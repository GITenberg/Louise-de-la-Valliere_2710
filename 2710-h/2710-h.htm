        Transcriber&rsquo;s Notes:
      </h3>
      <p>
        As you may be aware, Project Gutenberg has been involved with the
        writings of both the Alexandre Dumases for some time now, and since we
        get a few questions about the order in which the books should be read,
        and in which they were published, these following comments should
        hopefully help most of our readers.
      </p>
      ***
      <p>
        The Vicomte de Bragelonne is the final volume of D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances: it
        is usually split into three or four parts, and the final portion is
        entitled The Man in the Iron Mask. The Man in the Iron Mask we&rsquo;re
        familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition. [Not
        all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the
        confusion...but wait...there&rsquo;s yet more reason for confusion.]
      </p>
      <p>
        We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four etexts
        entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la
        Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask; you WILL be getting The Man in
        the Iron Mask.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,
        entitled Ten Years Later, says it&rsquo;s the sequel to The Three Musketeers.
        While this is technically true, there&rsquo;s another book, Twenty Years
        After, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts
        that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years
        After, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty
        Years &ldquo;After&rdquo; the original story...however, this is why the different
        words &ldquo;After&rdquo; and &ldquo;Later&rdquo;...the Ten Years &ldquo;After&rdquo; is ten years after the
        Twenty Years later.. .as per history. Also, the third book of the
        D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the
        subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different
        volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the
        first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later can,
        similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the
        four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,
        it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material
        in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the
        series which may prove helpful:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Three Musketeers: Etext 1257&mdash;First book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan
        Romances. Covers the years 1625-1628.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty Years After: Etext 1259&mdash;Second book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan
        Romances. Covers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we
        published, but second in time sequence!!!]
      </p>
      <p>
        Ten Years Later: Etext 1258&mdash;First 104 chapters of the third book
        of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the years 1660-1661.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Etext 2609 (first in the new series)&mdash;First
        75 chapters of the third book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the
        year 1660.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ten Years Later: Etext 2681 (second in the new series)&mdash;Chapters
        76-140 of that third book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the years
        1660-1661. [In this particular editing of it]
      </p>
      <p>
        Louise de la Valliere: Etext 2710 (our new text)&mdash;Chapters 141-208
        of the third book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the year 1661.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Man in the Iron Mask: forthcoming (our next text)&mdash;Chapters
        209-269 of the third book of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances. Covers the years
        1661-1673.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we&rsquo;ve calculated correctly, that fourth text SHOULD correspond to the
        modern editions of The Man in the Iron Mask, which is still widely
        circulated, and comprises about the last 1/4 of The Vicomte de
        Bragelonne.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a list of the other Dumas Etexts we have published so far:
      </p>
      <p>

        Dumas[Pere#6/French][tlpnrxxx.xxx]1910 This is an abridged edition in
        French, also see our full length English Etext Jul 1997 The Black Tulip,

    <h2>
      Introduction:
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le Siecle, the first
      portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated playwright Alexandre
      Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had found a year
      earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a history he
      planned to write on Louis XIV. They chronicled the adventures of a young
      man named D&rsquo;Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost immediately
      embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and ill-fated
      affairs between royal lovers. Over the next six years, readers would enjoy
      the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends, Porthos, Athos,
      and Aramis, as their exploits unraveled behind the scenes of some of the
      most momentous events in French and even English history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form, and
      became the three D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief summary
      of the first two novels:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Three Musketeers (serialized March&mdash;July, 1844): The year is
      1625. The young D&rsquo;Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and
      almost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.
      Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal&rsquo;s
      guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.
      The four become fast friends, and, when asked by D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s landlord to
      find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them across
      both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the Cardinal
      Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy, named
      simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of Austria
      before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the four
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty Years After (serialized January&mdash;August, 1845): The year is
      now 1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has
      died, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit
      upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV, the
      real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have
      retired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de
      la Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.
      Aramis, whose real name is D&rsquo;Herblay, has followed his intention of
      shedding the musketeer&rsquo;s cassock for the priest&rsquo;s robes, and Porthos has
      married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But
      trouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the
      institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at
      home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D&rsquo;Artagnan brings his
      friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch, but
      Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother&rsquo;s death at the
      musketeers&rsquo; hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our heroes
      return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV, quiet the
      Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October, 1847&mdash;January,
      1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English translation. It has
      been split into three, four, or five volumes at various points in its
      history. The five-volume edition generally does not give titles to the
      smaller portions, but the others do. In the three-volume edition, the
      novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Louise de la Valliere, and
      The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of this etext, I have chosen to
      split the novel as the four-volume edition does, with these titles: The
      Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la Valliere, and The Man
      in the Iron Mask. In the first two etexts:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become disgusted
      with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with the Cardinal
      Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on his own project,
      that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England, and, with the help
      of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune in the process.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich citizen, and Athos,
      after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king&rsquo;s brother, to Princess
      Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own estate, La Fere.
      Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to assume the reigns
      of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly Mazarin&rsquo;s trusted
      clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet, the king&rsquo;s
      superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any means necessary to
      bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant bestowed on him by
      Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet&rsquo;s loyal friends tried and
      executed. He then brings to the king&rsquo;s attention that Fouquet is
      fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could possibly be planning
      to use it as a base for some military operation against the king. Louis
      calls D&rsquo;Artagnan out of retirement and sends him to investigate the
      island, promising him a tremendous salary and his long-promised promotion
      to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At Belle-Isle, D&rsquo;Artagnan
      discovers that the engineer of the fortifications is, in fact, Porthos,
      now the Baron du Vallon, and that&rsquo;s not all. The blueprints for the
      island, although in Porthos&rsquo;s handwriting, show evidence of another script
      that has been erased, that of Aramis. D&rsquo;Artagnan later discovers that
      Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes, which is, coincidentally, a parish
      belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting that D&rsquo;Artagnan has arrived on the
      king&rsquo;s behalf to investigate, Aramis tricks D&rsquo;Artagnan into wandering
      around Vannes in search of Porthos, and sends Porthos on an heroic ride
      back to Paris to warn Fouquet of the danger. Fouquet rushes to the king,
      and gives him Belle-Isle as a present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at
      the same time humiliating Colbert, just minutes before the usher announces
      someone else seeking an audience with the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten Years Later (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches, Princess Henrietta of
      England arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of France into
      complete disorder. The jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is in love
      with her, nearly occasions a war on the streets of Le Havre, thankfully
      prevented by Raoul&rsquo;s timely and tactful intervention. After the marriage,
      though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of Buckingham, and has
      him exiled. Before leaving, however, the duke fights a duel with M. de
      Wardes at Calais. De Wardes is a malicious and spiteful man, the sworn
      enemy of D&rsquo;Artagnan, and, by the same token, that of Athos, Aramis,
      Porthos, and Raoul as well. Both men are seriously wounded, and the duke
      is taken back to England to recover. Raoul&rsquo;s friend, the Comte de Guiche,
      is the next to succumb to Henrietta&rsquo;s charms, and Monsieur obtains his
      exile as well, though De Guiche soon effects a reconciliation. But then
      the king&rsquo;s eye falls on Madame Henrietta during the comte&rsquo;s absence, and
      this time Monsieur&rsquo;s jealousy has no recourse. Anne of Austria intervenes,
      and the king and his sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom
      the king can pretend to be in love, the better to mask their own affair.
      They unfortunately select Louise de la Valliere, Raoul&rsquo;s fiancee. While
      the court is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears
      Louise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends beneath
      the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets his affection for Madame.
      That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De Guiche
      confessing his love for her to Raoul. The two embark on their own affair.
      A few days later, during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise are trapped alone
      together, and the whole court begins to talk of the scandal while their
      love affair blossoms. Aware of Louise&rsquo;s attachment, the king arranges for
      Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.
      Although the Belle-Isle plot backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask
      Fouquet for more and more money, and without his two friends to raise it
      for him, Fouquet is sorely pressed. The situation gets so bad that his new
      mistress, Madame de Belliere, must resort to selling all her jewels and
      her gold and silver plate. Aramis, while this is going on, has grown
      friendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de Baisemeaux, a fact that
      Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D&rsquo;Artagnan while inquiring of him as to
      Aramis&rsquo;s whereabouts. This further arouses the suspicions of the
      musketeer, who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis. He had ridden
      overnight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet had
      already presented Belle-Isle to the king. Aramis learns from the governor
      the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a remarkable resemblance
      to Louis XIV&mdash;in fact, the two are identical. He uses the existence
      of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the general of the
      society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new general of the order.
      On Aramis&rsquo;s advice, hoping to use Louise&rsquo;s influence with the king to
      counteract Colbert&rsquo;s influence, Fouquet also writes a love letter to La
      Valliere, unfortunately undated. It never reaches its destination,
      however, as the servant ordered to deliver it turns out to be an agent of
      Colbert&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, in the meantime, has been recovering from his midnight ride from
      Belle-Isle at Fouquet&rsquo;s residence at Saint-Mande. Athos has retired, once
      again to La Fere. D&rsquo;Artagnan, little amused by the court&rsquo;s activities at
      Fontainebleau, and finding himself with nothing to do, has returned to
      Paris, and we find him again in Planchet&rsquo;s grocery shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, the story continues in this, the third etext of The Vicomte de
      Bragelonne. Enjoy!

    <h2>
      Chapter I. Malaga.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During all these long and noisy debates between the opposite ambitions of
      politics and love, one of our characters, perhaps the one least deserving
      of neglect, was, however, very much neglected, very much forgotten, and
      exceedingly unhappy. In fact, D&rsquo;Artagnan&mdash;D&rsquo;Artagnan, we say, for we
      must call him by his name, to remind our readers of his existence&mdash;D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      we repeat, had absolutely nothing whatever to do, amidst these brilliant
      butterflies of fashion. After following the king during two whole days at
      Fontainebleau, and critically observing the various pastoral fancies and
      heroi-comic transformations of his sovereign, the musketeer felt that he
      needed something more than this to satisfy the cravings of his nature. At
      every moment assailed by people asking him, &ldquo;How do you think this costume
      suits me, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo; he would reply to them in quiet, sarcastic
      tones, &ldquo;Why, I think you are quite as well-dressed as the best-dressed
      monkey to be found in the fair at Saint-Laurent.&rdquo; It was just such a
      compliment D&rsquo;Artagnan would choose where he did not feel disposed to pay
      any other: and, whether agreeable or not, the inquirer was obliged to be
      satisfied with it. Whenever any one asked him, &ldquo;How do you intend to dress
      yourself this evening?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I shall undress myself;&rdquo; at which the
      ladies all laughed, and a few of them blushed. But after a couple of days
      passed in this manner, the musketeer, perceiving that nothing serious was
      likely to arise which would concern him, and that the king had completely,
      or, at least, appeared to have completely forgotten Paris, Saint-Mande,
      and Belle-Isle&mdash;that M. Colbert&rsquo;s mind was occupied with
      illuminations and fireworks&mdash;that for the next month, at least, the
      ladies had plenty of glances to bestow, and also to receive in exchange&mdash;D&rsquo;Artagnan
      asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of private business. At
      the moment D&rsquo;Artagnan made his request, his majesty was on the point of
      going to bed, quite exhausted from dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to leave me, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo; inquired the king, with an
      air of astonishment; for Louis XIV. could never understand why any one who
      had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I leave you simply because I am not of the
      slightest service to you in anything. Ah! if I could only hold the
      balancing-pole while you were dancing, it would be a very different
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said the king, gravely, &ldquo;people dance
      without balancing-poles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! indeed,&rdquo; said the musketeer, continuing his imperceptible tone of
      irony, &ldquo;I had no idea such a thing was possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not seen me dance, then?&rdquo; inquired the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I always thought dancers went from easy to difficult acrobatic
      feats. I was mistaken; all the more greater reason, therefore, that I
      should leave for a time. Sire, I repeat, you have no present occasion for
      my services; besides, if your majesty should have any need of me, you
      would know where to find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the king, and he granted him leave of absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall not look for D&rsquo;Artagnan, therefore, at Fontainebleau, for to do
      so would be useless; but, with the permission of our readers, follow him
      to the Rue des Lombards, where he was located at the sign of the Pilon
      d&rsquo;Or, in the house of our old friend Planchet. It was about eight o&rsquo;clock
      in the evening, and the weather was exceedingly warm; there was only one
      window open, and that one belonging to a room on the <i>entresol</i>. A
      perfume of spices, mingled with another perfume less exotic, but more
      penetrating, namely, that which arose from the street, ascended to salute
      the nostrils of the musketeer. D&rsquo;Artagnan, reclining in an immense
      straight-backed chair, with his legs not stretched out, but simply placed
      upon a stool, formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly
      be seen. Both his arms were crossed over his head, his head reclining upon
      his left shoulder, like Alexander the Great. His eyes, usually so quick
      and intelligent in their expression, were now half-closed, and seemed
      fastened, as it were, upon a small corner of blue sky that was visible
      behind the opening of the chimneys; there was just enough blue, and no
      more, to fill one of the sacks of lentils, or haricots, which formed the
      principal furniture of the shop on the ground floor. Thus extended at his
      ease, and sheltered in his place of observation behind the window,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan seemed as if he had ceased to be a soldier, as if he were no
      longer an officer belonging to the palace, but was, on the contrary, a
      quiet, easy-going citizen in a state of stagnation between his dinner and
      supper, or between his supper and his bed; one of those strong, ossified
      brains, which have no more room for a single idea, so fiercely does animal
      matter keep watch at the doors of intelligence, narrowly inspecting the
      contraband trade which might result from the introduction into the brain
      of a symptom of thought. We have already said night was closing in, the
      shops were being lighted, while the windows of the upper apartments were
      being closed, and the rhythmic steps of a patrol of soldiers forming the
      night watch could be heard retreating. D&rsquo;Artagnan continued, however, to
      think of nothing, except the blue corner of the sky. A few paces from him,
      completely in the shade, lying on his stomach, upon a sack of Indian corn,
      was Planchet, with both his arms under his chin, and his eyes fixed on
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, who was either thinking, dreaming, or sleeping, with his eyes
      open. Planchet had been watching him for a tolerably long time, and, by
      way of interruption, he began by exclaiming, &ldquo;Hum! hum!&rdquo; But D&rsquo;Artagnan
      did not stir. Planchet then saw that it was necessary to have recourse to
      more effectual means still: after a prolonged reflection on the subject,
      the most ingenious means that suggested itself to him under the present
      circumstances, was to let himself roll off the sack on to the floor,
      murmuring, at the same time, against himself, the word &ldquo;stupid.&rdquo; But,
      notwithstanding the noise produced by Planchet&rsquo;s fall, D&rsquo;Artagnan, who had
      in the course of his existence heard many other, and very different falls,
      did not appear to pay the least attention to the present one. Besides, an
      enormous cart, laden with stones, passing from the Rue Saint-Mederic,
      absorbed, in the noise of its wheels, the noise of Planchet&rsquo;s tumble. And
      yet Planchet fancied that, in token of tacit approval, he saw him
      imperceptibly smile at the word &ldquo;stupid.&rdquo; This emboldened him to say, &ldquo;Are
      you asleep, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Planchet, I am not <i>even</i> asleep,&rdquo; replied the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in despair,&rdquo; said Planchet, &ldquo;to hear such a word as <i>even</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and why not; is it not a grammatical word, Monsieur Planchet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the word distresses me beyond measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me why you are distressed, Planchet,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say that you are not <i>even</i> asleep, it is as much as to say
      that you have not even the consolation of being able to sleep; or, better
      still, it is precisely the same as telling me that you are getting bored
      to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planchet, you know that I am never bored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except to-day, and the day before yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, it is a week since you returned here from
      Fontainebleau; in other words, you have no longer your orders to issue, or
      your men to review and maneuver. You need the sound of guns, drums, and
      all that din and confusion; I, who have myself carried a musket, can
      easily believe that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planchet,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I assure you I am not bored in the least
      in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, what are you doing, lying there, as if you were dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Planchet, there was, once upon a time, at the siege of La
      Rochelle, when I was there, when you were there, when we both were there,
      a certain Arab, who was celebrated for the manner in which he adjusted
      culverins. He was a clever fellow, although of a very odd complexion,
      which was the same color as your olives. Well, this Arab, whenever he had
      done eating or working, used to sit down to rest himself, as I am resting
      myself now, and smoked I cannot tell you what sort of magical leaves, in a
      large amber-mouthed tube; and if any officers, happening to pass,
      reproached him for being always asleep, he used quietly to reply: &lsquo;Better
      to sit down than to stand up, to lie down than to sit down, to be dead
      than to lie down.&rsquo; He was an acutely melancholy Arab, and I remember him
      perfectly well, form the color of his skin, and the style of his
      conversation. He used to cut off the heads of Protestants with the most
      singular gusto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; and then used to embalm them, when they were worth the
      trouble; and when he was thus engaged with his herbs and plants about him,
      he looked like a basket-maker making baskets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, Planchet, he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I can remember things very well, at times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it; but what do you think of his mode of reasoning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it good in one sense, but very stupid in another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expound your meaning, M. Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, in point of fact, then, &lsquo;better to sit down than to stand
      up,&rsquo; is plain enough, especially when one may be fatigued,&rdquo; and Planchet
      smiled in a roguish way; &ldquo;as for &lsquo;better to be lying down,&rsquo; let that pass,
      but as for the last proposition, that it is &lsquo;better to be dead than
      alive,&rsquo; it is, in my opinion, very absurd, my own undoubted preference
      being for my bed; and if you are not of my opinion, it is simply, as I
      have already had the honor of telling you, because you are boring yourself
      to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planchet, do you know M. La Fontaine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chemist at the corner of the Rue Saint-Mederic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the writer of fables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>Maitre Corbeau!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; well, then, I am like his hare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got a hare also, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has all sorts of animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what does his hare do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. La Fontaine&rsquo;s hare thinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planchet, I am like that hare&mdash;I am thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking, you say?&rdquo; said Planchet, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; your house is dull enough to drive people to think; you will admit
      that, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, monsieur, you have a look-out upon the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and wonderfully interesting that is, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is no less true, monsieur, that, if you were living at the back of
      the house, you would bore yourself&mdash;I mean, you would think&mdash;more
      than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Planchet, I hardly know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the grocer, &ldquo;if your reflections are at all like those which
      led you to restore King Charles II.&mdash;&rdquo; and Planchet finished by a
      little laugh which was not without its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Planchet, my friend,&rdquo; returned D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you are getting
      ambitious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no other king to be restored, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan&mdash;no second Monk
      to be packed up, like a salted hog, in a deal box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Planchet; all the kings are seated on their respective
      thrones; less comfortably so, perhaps, than I am upon this chair; but, at
      all events, there they are.&rdquo; And D&rsquo;Artagnan sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said Planchet, &ldquo;you are making me very uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good, Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to suspect something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, you are getting thin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, striking his chest which sounded like an empty
      cuirass, &ldquo;it is impossible, Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Planchet, slightly overcome; &ldquo;if you were to get thin in my
      house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should do something rash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do? Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should look out for the man who was the cause of all your anxieties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! according to your account, I am anxious now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are anxious; and you are getting thin, visibly getting thin. <i>Malaga!</i>
      if you go on getting thin, in this way, I will take my sword in my hand,
      and go straight to M. d&rsquo;Herblay, and have it out with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, starting in his chair; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that you say?
      And what has M. d&rsquo;Herblay&rsquo;s name to do with your groceries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you please. Get angry if you like, or call me names, if you
      prefer it; but, the deuce is in it. <i>I know what I know</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had, during this second outburst of Planchet&rsquo;s, so placed
      himself as not to lose a single look of his face; that is, he sat with
      both his hands resting on both his knees, and his head stretched out
      towards the grocer. &ldquo;Come, explain yourself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and tell me how
      you could possibly utter such a blasphemy. M. d&rsquo;Herblay, your old master,
      my friend, an ecclesiastic, a musketeer turned bishop&mdash;do you mean to
      say you would raise your sword against him, Planchet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could raise my sword against my own father, when I see you in such a
      state as you are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay, a gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me whether he&rsquo;s a gentleman or not. He gives you the
      blue devils, that is all I know. And the blue devils make people get thin.
      <i>Malaga!</i> I have no notion of M. d&rsquo;Artagnan leaving my house thinner
      than when he entered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he give me the blue devils, as you call it? Come, explain,
      explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had the nightmare during the last three nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you; and in your nightmare you called out, several times, &lsquo;Aramis,
      deceitful Aramis!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I said that, did I?&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, those very words, upon my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what else? You know the saying, Planchet, &lsquo;dreams go by
      contraries.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so; for every time, during the last three days, when you went out,
      you have not once failed to ask me, on your return, &lsquo;Have you seen M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay?&rsquo; or else &lsquo;Have you received any letters for me from M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is very natural I should take an interest in my old friend,&rdquo;
       said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; but not to such an extent as to get thin on that account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planchet, I&rsquo;ll get fatter; I give you my word of honor I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, monsieur, I accept it; for I know that when you give your word
      of honor, it is sacred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not dream of Aramis any more; and I will never ask you again if
      there are any letters from M. d&rsquo;Herblay; but on condition that you explain
      one thing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what it is, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a great observer; and just now you made use of a very singular oath,
      which is unusual for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean <i>Malaga!</i> I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the oath I have used ever since I have been a grocer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very proper, too; it is the name of a dried grape, or raisin, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my most ferocious oath; when I have once said <i>Malaga!</i> I am a
      man no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I never knew you use that oath before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely not, monsieur. I had a present made me of it,&rdquo; said Planchet;
      and, as he pronounced these words, he winked his eye with a cunning
      expression, which thoroughly awakened D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, M. Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am not like you, monsieur,&rdquo; said Planchet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pass my life
      in thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do wrong, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean in boring myself to death. We have but a very short time to live&mdash;why
      not make the best of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an Epicurean philosopher, I begin to think, Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? My hand is still as steady as ever; I can write, and can weigh
      out my sugar and spices; my foot is firm; I can dance and walk about; my
      stomach has its teeth still, for I eat and digest very well; my heart is
      not quite hardened. Well, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what, Planchet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see&mdash;&rdquo; said the grocer, rubbing his hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan crossed one leg over the other, and said, &ldquo;Planchet, my friend,
      I am unnerved with extreme surprise; for you are revealing yourself to me
      under a perfectly new light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planchet, flattered in the highest degree by this remark, continued to rub
      his hands very hard together. &ldquo;Ah, ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I happen to be
      only slow, you think me, perhaps, a positive fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Planchet; very well reasoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow my idea, monsieur, if you please. I said to myself,&rdquo; continued
      Planchet, &ldquo;that, without enjoyment, there is no happiness on this earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, what you say, Planchet,&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, if we cannot obtain pleasure&mdash;for pleasure is not so
      common a thing, after all&mdash;let us, at least, get consolations of some
      kind or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you console yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how you console yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put on a buckler for the purpose of confronting <i>ennui</i>. I place
      my time at the direction of patience; and on the very eve of feeling I am
      going to get bored, I amuse myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t find any difficulty in that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found it out quite by yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is miraculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, that your philosophy is not to be matched in the Christian or
      pagan world, in modern days or in antiquity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&mdash;follow my example, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very tempting one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not wish for anything better; but all minds are not of the same
      stamp; and it might possibly happen that if I were required to amuse
      myself in the manner you do, I should bore myself horribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! at least try first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell me what you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you observed that I leave home occasionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any particular way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Periodically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing. You have noticed it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Planchet, you must understand that when people see each other
      every day, and one of the two absents himself, the other misses him. Do
      you not feel the want of my society when I am in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prodigiously; that is to say, I feel like a body without a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That being understood then, proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the periods when I absent myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the fifteenth and thirtieth of every month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I remain away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes two, sometimes three, and sometimes four days at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever given it a thought, why I was absent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look after your debts, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I returned, how did you think I looked, as far as my face was
      concerned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exceedingly self-satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit, you say, that I always look satisfied. And what have you
      attributed my satisfaction to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That your business was going on very well; that your purchases of rice,
      prunes, raw sugar, dried apples, pears, and treacle were advantageous. You
      were always very picturesque in your notions and ideas, Planchet; and I
      was not in the slightest degree surprised to find you had selected grocery
      as an occupation, which is of all trades the most varied, and the very
      pleasantest, as far as the character is concerned; inasmuch as one handles
      so many natural and perfumed productions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true, monsieur; but you are very greatly mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In thinking that I leave here every fortnight, to collect my money or to
      make purchases. Ho, ho! how could you possibly have thought such a thing?
      Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; And Planchet began to laugh in a manner that inspired
      D&rsquo;Artagnan with very serious misgivings as to his sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said the musketeer, &ldquo;that I do not precisely catch your
      meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;very true&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be true, since you say it; but pray, be assured that it in no way
      lessens my opinion of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you are a man of genius; and whenever the question happens to be of
      war, tactics, surprises, or good honest blows to be dealt with, why, kings
      are marionettes, compared to you. But for the consolations of the mind,
      the proper care of the body, the agreeable things of like, if one may say
      so&mdash;ah! monsieur, don&rsquo;t talk to me about men of genius; they are
      nothing short of executioners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, really fidgety with curiosity, &ldquo;upon my word you
      interest me in the highest degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel already less bored than you did just now, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not bored; yet since you have been talking to me, I feel more
      animated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then; that is not a bad beginning. I will cure you, rely upon
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing I should like better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me try, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Have you any horses here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; ten, twenty, thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is no occasion for so many as that, two will be quite
      sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are quite at your disposal, Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then I shall carry you off with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are asking too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will admit, however, that it is important I should know where I am
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only moderately, Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case you like town better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I am going to take you to a place, half town and half
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a place where I am sure you will amuse yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and more wonderful still, to a place from which you have just
      returned for the purpose only, it would seem, of getting bored here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to Fontainebleau you are going, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; to Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, what are you going to do at Fontainebleau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planchet answered D&rsquo;Artagnan by a wink full of sly humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some property there, you rascal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a very paltry affair; a little bit of a house&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is tolerable enough, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Planchet&rsquo;s country-seat!&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did we not fix to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us say to-morrow, if you like; and then, besides, to-morrow is the
      14th, that is to say, the day before the one when I am afraid of getting
      bored; so we will look upon it as an understood thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed, by all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will lend me one of your horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I prefer the gentlest of all; I never was a very good rider, as you
      know, and in my grocery business I have got more awkward than ever;
      besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; added Planchet, &ldquo;I do not wish to fatigue myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan ventured to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I should lose half the pleasure I expect to enjoy,&rdquo; replied
      Planchet. And thereupon he rose from his sack of Indian corn, stretching
      himself, and making all his bones crack, one after the other, with a sort
      of harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planchet! Planchet!&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I do declare that there is no
      sybarite upon the face of the globe who can for a moment be compared to
      you. Oh, Planchet, it is very clear that we have never yet eaten a ton of
      salt together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, even now I can scarcely say I know you,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;and
      because, in point of fact, I return to the opinion which, for a moment, I
      had formed of you that day at Boulogne, when you strangled, or did so as
      nearly as possible, M. de Wardes&rsquo;s valet, Lubin; in plain language,
      Planchet, that you are a man of great resources.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planchet began to laugh with a laugh full of self-conceit; bade the
      musketeer good-night, and went down to his back shop, which he used as a
      bedroom. D&rsquo;Artagnan resumed his original position upon his chair, and his
      brow, which had been unruffled for a moment, became more pensive than
      ever. He had already forgotten the whims and dreams of Planchet. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
       said he, taking up again the thread of his thoughts, which had been broken
      by the whimsical conversation in which we have just permitted our readers
      to participate. &ldquo;Yes, yes, those three points include everything: First,
      to ascertain what Baisemeaux wanted with Aramis; secondly, to learn why
      Aramis does not let me hear from him; and thirdly, to ascertain where
      Porthos is. The whole mystery lies in these three points. Since,
      therefore,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;our friends tell us nothing, we must
      have recourse to our own poor intelligence. I must do what I can, <i>mordioux</i>,
      or rather <i>Malaga</i>, as Planchet would say.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter II. A Letter from M. Baisemeaux.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, faithful to his plan, went the very next morning to pay a
      visit to M. de Baisemeaux. It was cleaning up or tidying day at the
      Bastile; the cannons were furbished up, the staircases scraped and
      cleaned; and the jailers seemed to be carefully engaged in polishing the
      very keys. As for the soldiers belonging to the garrison, they were
      walking about in different courtyards, under the pretense that they were
      clean enough. The governor, Baisemeaux, received D&rsquo;Artagnan with more than
      ordinary politeness, but he behaved towards him with so marked a reserve
      of manner, that all D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s tact and cleverness could not get a
      syllable out of him. The more he kept himself within bounds, the more
      D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s suspicion increased. The latter even fancied he remarked that
      the governor was acting under the influence of a recent recommendation.
      Baisemeaux had not been at the Palais Royal with D&rsquo;Artagnan the same cold
      and impenetrable man which the latter now found in the Baisemeaux of the
      Bastile. When D&rsquo;Artagnan wished to make him talk about the urgent money
      matters which had brought Baisemeaux in search of D&rsquo;Artagnan, and had
      rendered him expansive, notwithstanding what had passed on that evening,
      Baisemeaux pretended that he had some orders to give in the prison, and
      left D&rsquo;Artagnan so long alone waiting for him, that our musketeer, feeling
      sure that he should not get another syllable out of him, left the Bastile
      without waiting until Baisemeaux returned from his inspection. But
      D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s suspicions were aroused, and when once that was the case,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan could not sleep or remain quiet for a moment. He was among men
      what the cat is among quadrupeds, the emblem of anxiety and impatience, at
      the same moment. A restless cat can no more remain the same place than a
      silk thread wafted idly to and fro with every breath of air. A cat on the
      watch is as motionless as death stationed at its place of observation, and
      neither hunger nor thirst can draw it from its meditations. D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      who was burning with impatience, suddenly threw aside the feeling, like a
      cloak which he felt too heavy on his shoulders, and said to himself that
      that which they were concealing from him was the very thing it was
      important he should know; and, consequently, he reasoned that Baisemeaux
      would not fail to put Aramis on his guard, if Aramis had given him any
      particular recommendation, and this was, in fact, the very thing that
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux had hardly had time to return from the donjon, than D&rsquo;Artagnan
      placed himself in ambuscade close to the Rue de Petit-Musc, so as to see
      every one who might leave the gates of the Bastile. After he had spent an
      hour on the look-out from the &ldquo;Golden Portcullis,&rdquo; under the pent-house of
      which he could keep himself a little in the shade, D&rsquo;Artagnan observed a
      soldier leave the Bastile. This was, indeed, the surest indication he
      could possibly have wished for, as every jailer or warder has certain
      days, and even certain hours, for leaving the Bastile, since all are alike
      prohibited from having either wives or lodgings in the castle, and can
      accordingly leave without exciting any curiosity; but a soldier once in
      barracks is kept there for four and twenty hours when on duty,&mdash;and
      no one knew this better than D&rsquo;Artagnan. The guardsman in question,
      therefore, was not likely to leave his regimentals, except on an express
      and urgent order. The soldier, we were saying, left the Bastile at a slow
      and lounging pace, like a happy mortal, in fact, who, instead of mounting
      sentry before a wearisome guard-house, or upon a bastion no less
      wearisome, has the good luck to get a little liberty, in addition to a
      walk&mdash;both pleasures being luckily reckoned as part of his time on
      duty. He bent his steps towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, enjoying the
      fresh air and the warmth of the sun, and looking at all the pretty faces
      he passed. D&rsquo;Artagnan followed him at a distance; he had not yet arranged
      his ideas as what was to be done. &ldquo;I must, first of all,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;see
      the fellow&rsquo;s face. A man seen is a man judged.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan increased his
      pace, and, which was not very difficult, by the by, soon got in advance of
      the soldier. Not only did he observe that his face showed a tolerable
      amount of intelligence and resolution, but he noticed also that his nose
      was a little red. &ldquo;He has a weakness for brandy, I see,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan
      to himself. At the same moment that he remarked his red nose, he saw that
      the soldier had a white paper in his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, he has a letter,&rdquo; added D&rsquo;Artagnan. The only difficulty was to get
      hold of the letter. But a common soldier would, of course, be only too
      delighted at having been selected by M. de Baisemeaux as a special
      messenger, and would not be likely to sell his message. As D&rsquo;Artagnan was
      biting his nails, the soldier continued to advance more and more into the
      Faubourg Saint-Antoine. &ldquo;He is certainly going to Saint-Mande,&rdquo; he said to
      himself, &ldquo;and I shall not be able to learn what the letter contains.&rdquo; It
      was enough to drive him wild. &ldquo;If I were in uniform,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan to
      himself, &ldquo;I would have this fellow seized, and his letter with him. I
      could easily get assistance at the very first guard-house; but the devil
      take me if I mention my name in an affair of this kind. If I were to treat
      him to something to drink, his suspicions would be roused; and besides, he
      might drink me drunk. <i>Mordioux!</i> my wits seem to have left me,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;it is all over with me. Yet, supposing I were to attack this
      poor devil, make him draw his sword and kill him for the sake of his
      letter? No harm in that, if it were a question of a letter from a queen to
      a nobleman, or a letter from a cardinal to a queen; but what miserable
      intrigues are those of Messieurs Aramis and Fouquet with M. Colbert. A
      man&rsquo;s life for that? No, no, indeed; not even ten crowns.&rdquo; As he
      philosophized in this manner, biting first his nails, and then his
      mustaches, he perceived a group of archers and a commissary of the police
      engaged in carrying away a man of very gentlemanly exterior, who was
      struggling with all his might against them. The archers had torn his
      clothes, and were dragging him roughly away. He begged they would lead him
      along more respectfully, asserting that he was a gentleman and a soldier.
      And observing our soldier walking in the street, he called out, &ldquo;Help,
      comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier walked on with the same step towards the man who had called
      out to him, followed by the crowd. An idea suddenly occurred to
      D&rsquo;Artagnan; it was his first one, and we shall find it was not a bad one
      either. During the time the gentleman was relating to the soldier that he
      had just been seized in a house as a thief, when the truth was he was only
      there as a lover; and while the soldier was pitying him, and offering him
      consolation and advice with that gravity which a French soldier has always
      ready whenever his vanity or his <i>esprit de corps</i> is concerned,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan glided behind the soldier, who was closely hemmed in by the
      crowd, and with a rapid sweep, like a sabre slash, snatched the letter
      from his belt. As at this moment the gentleman with the torn clothes was
      pulling about the soldier, to show how the commissary of police had pulled
      him about, D&rsquo;Artagnan effected his pillage of the letter without the
      slightest interference. He stationed himself about ten paces distant,
      behind the pillar of an adjoining house, and read on the address, &ldquo;To
      Monsieur du Vallon, at Monsieur Fouquet&rsquo;s, Saint-Mande.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said, and then he unsealed, without tearing the letter, drew
      out the paper, which was folded in four, from the inside; which contained
      only these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MONSIEUR DU VALLON,&mdash;Will you be good enough to tell Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Herblay that <i>he</i> has been to the Bastile, and has been making
      inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your devoted
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DE BAISEMEAUX.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good! all right!&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;it is clear enough now.
      Porthos is engaged in it.&rdquo; Being now satisfied of what he wished to know:
      &ldquo;<i>Mordioux!</i>&rdquo; thought the musketeer, &ldquo;what is to be done with that
      poor devil of a soldier? That hot-headed, cunning fellow, De Baisemeaux,
      will make him pay dearly for my trick,&mdash;if he returns without the
      letter, what will they do to him? Besides, I don&rsquo;t want the letter; when
      the egg has been sucked, what is the good of the shell?&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan
      perceived that the commissary and the archers had succeeded in convincing
      the soldier, and went on their way with the prisoner, the latter being
      still surrounded by the crowd, and continuing his complaints. D&rsquo;Artagnan
      advanced into the very middle of the crowd, let the letter fall, without
      any one having observed him, and then retreated rapidly. The soldier
      resumed his route towards Saint-Mande, his mind occupied with the
      gentleman who had implored his protection. Suddenly he thought of his
      letter, and, looking at his belt, saw that it was no longer there.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan derived no little satisfaction from his sudden, terrified cry.
      The poor soldier in the greatest anguish of mind looked round him on every
      side, and at last, about twenty paces behind him, he perceived the lucky
      envelope. He pounced on it like a falcon on its prey. The envelope was
      certainly a little dirty, and rather crumpled, but at all events the
      letter itself was found. D&rsquo;Artagnan observed that the broken seal
      attracted the soldier&rsquo;s attention a good deal, but he finished apparently
      by consoling himself, and returned the letter to his belt. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I have plenty of time before me, so you may precede me. It
      appears that Aramis is not in Paris, since Baisemeaux writes to Porthos.
      Dear Porthos, how delighted I shall be to see him again, and to have some
      conversation with him!&rdquo; said the Gascon. And, regulating his pace
      according to that of the soldier, he promised himself to arrive a quarter
      of an hour after him at M. Fouquet&rsquo;s.

    <h2>
      Chapter III. In Which the Reader will be Delighted to Find that Porthos
      Has Lost Nothing of His Muscularity.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had, according to his usual style, calculated that every hour
      is worth sixty minutes, and every minute worth sixty seconds. Thanks to
      this perfectly exact calculation of minutes and seconds, he reached the
      superintendent&rsquo;s door at the very moment the soldier was leaving it with
      his belt empty. D&rsquo;Artagnan presented himself at the door, which a porter
      with a profusely embroidered livery held half opened for him. D&rsquo;Artagnan
      would very much have liked to enter without giving his name, but this was
      impossible, and so he gave it. Notwithstanding this concession, which
      ought to have removed every difficulty in the way, at least D&rsquo;Artagnan
      thought so, the <i>concierge</i> hesitated; however, at the second
      repetition of the title, captain of the king&rsquo;s guards, the <i>concierge</i>,
      without quite leaving the passage clear for him, ceased to bar it
      completely. D&rsquo;Artagnan understood that orders of the most positive
      character had been given. He decided, therefore, to tell a falsehood,&mdash;a
      circumstance, moreover, which did not seriously affect his peace of mind,
      when he saw that beyond the falsehood the safety of the state itself, or
      even purely and simply his own individual personal interest, might be at
      stake. He moreover added to the declarations he had already made, that the
      soldier sent to M. du Vallon was his own messenger, and that the only
      object that letter had in view was to announce his intended arrival. From
      that moment, no one opposed D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s entrance any further, and he
      entered accordingly. A valet wished to accompany him, but he answered that
      it was useless to take that trouble on his account, inasmuch as he knew
      perfectly well where M. du Vallon was. There was nothing, of course, to
      say to a man so thoroughly and completely informed on all points, and
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was permitted, therefore, to do as he liked. The terraces, the
      magnificent apartments, the gardens, were all reviewed and narrowly
      inspected by the musketeer. He walked for a quarter of an hour in this
      more than royal residence, which included as many wonders as articles of
      furniture, and as many servants as there were columns and doors.
      &ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;this mansion has no other limits than
      the pillars of the habitable world. Is it probable Porthos has taken it
      into his head to go back to Pierrefonds without even leaving M. Fouquet&rsquo;s
      house?&rdquo; He finally reached a remote part of the chateau inclosed by a
      stone wall, which was covered with a profusion of thick plants, luxuriant
      in blossoms as large and solid as fruit. At equal distances on the top of
      this wall were placed various statues in timid or mysterious attitudes.
      These were vestals hidden beneath the long Greek peplum, with its thick,
      sinuous folds; agile nymphs, covered with their marble veils, and guarding
      the palace with their fugitive glances. A statue of Hermes, with his
      finger on his lips; one of Iris, with extended wings; another of Night,
      sprinkled all over with poppies, dominated the gardens and outbuildings,
      which could be seen through the trees. All these statues threw in white
      relief their profiles upon the dark ground of the tall cypresses, which
      darted their somber summits towards the sky. Around these cypresses were
      entwined climbing roses, whose flowering rings were fastened to every fork
      of the branches, and spread over the lower boughs and the various statues,
      showers of flowers of the rarest fragrance. These enchantments seemed to
      the musketeer the result of the greatest efforts of the human mind. He
      felt in a dreamy, almost poetical, frame of mind. The idea that Porthos
      was living in so perfect an Eden gave him a higher idea of Porthos,
      showing how tremendously true it is, that even the very highest orders of
      minds are not quite exempt from the influence of surroundings. D&rsquo;Artagnan
      found the door, and on, or rather in the door, a kind of spring which he
      detected; having touched it, the door flew open. D&rsquo;Artagnan entered,
      closed the door behind him, and advanced into a pavilion built in a
      circular form, in which no other sound could be heard but cascades and the
      songs of birds. At the door of the pavilion he met a lackey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here, I believe,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, without hesitation, &ldquo;that M. le
      Baron du Vallon is staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; answered the lackey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the goodness to tell him that M. le Chevalier d&rsquo;Artagnan, captain of
      the king&rsquo;s musketeers, is waiting to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was introduced into the <i>salon</i>, and had not long to
      remain in expectation: a well-remembered step shook the floor of the
      adjoining room, a door opened, or rather flew open, and Porthos appeared
      and threw himself into his friend&rsquo;s arms with a sort of embarrassment
      which did not ill become him. &ldquo;You here?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Ah, you sly fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Porthos, with a somewhat embarrassed smile; &ldquo;yes, you see I am
      staying in M. Fouquet&rsquo;s house, at which you are not a little surprised, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; why should you not be one of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s friends? M. Fouquet
      has a very large number, particularly among clever men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos had the modesty not to take the compliment to himself. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo;
       he added, &ldquo;you saw me at Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A greater reason for my believing you to be one of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, I am acquainted with him,&rdquo; said Porthos, with a certain
      embarrassment of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, friend Porthos,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;how treacherously you have behaved
      towards me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; exclaimed Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you complete so admirable a work as the fortifications of
      Belle-Isle, and you did not tell me of it!&rdquo; Porthos colored. &ldquo;Nay, more
      than that,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you saw me out yonder, you know I am in
      the king&rsquo;s service, and yet you could not guess that the king, jealously
      desirous of learning the name of the man whose abilities had wrought a
      work of which he heard the most wonderful accounts,&mdash;you could not
      guess, I say, that the king sent me to learn who this man was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! the king sent you to learn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; but don&rsquo;t let us speak of that any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not speak of it!&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;on the contrary, we will speak of it;
      and so the king knew that we were fortifying Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; does not the king know everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he did not know who was fortifying it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he only suspected, from what he had been told of the nature of the
      works, that it was some celebrated soldier or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;if I had only known that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not have run away from Vannes as you did, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; what did you say when you couldn&rsquo;t find me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I reflected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed; you reflect, do you? Well, and what did that reflection lead
      to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It led me to guess the whole truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then, tell me what did you guess after all?&rdquo; said Porthos, settling
      himself into an armchair, and assuming the airs of a sphinx.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed, in the first place, that you were fortifying Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no great difficulty in that, for you saw me at work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute; I also guessed something else,&mdash;that you were
      fortifying Belle-Isle by M. Fouquet&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even that is not all. Whenever I feel myself in trim for guessing, I
      do not stop on my road; and so I guessed that M. Fouquet wished to
      preserve the most absolute secrecy respecting these fortifications.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that was his intention, in fact,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but do you know why he wished to keep it secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order it should not become known, perhaps,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was his principal reason. But his wish was subservient to a bit of
      generosity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;I have heard it said that M. Fouquet was a very
      generous man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a bit of generosity he wished to exhibit towards the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem surprised at that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wizard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a very simple means. I heard M. Fouquet himself say so to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what to the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he fortified Belle-Isle on his majesty&rsquo;s account, and that he had
      made him a present of Belle Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you heard M. Fouquet say that to the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those very words. He even added: &lsquo;Belle-Isle has been fortified by an
      engineer, one of my friends, a man of a great deal of merit, whom I shall
      ask your majesty&rsquo;s permission to present to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is his name?&rsquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Baron du Vallon,&rsquo; M. Fouquet replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; returned his majesty, &lsquo;you will present him to me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king said that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon the word of a D&rsquo;Artagnan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;Why have I not been presented, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they not spoken to you about this presentation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly; but I am always kept waiting for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be easy, it will be sure to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! humph!&rdquo; grumbled Porthos, which D&rsquo;Artagnan pretended not to hear;
      and, changing the conversation, he said, &ldquo;You seem to be living in a very
      solitary place here, my dear fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always preferred retirement. I am of a melancholy disposition,&rdquo; replied
      Porthos, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, that is odd,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I never remarked that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only since I have taken to reading,&rdquo; said Porthos, with a
      thoughtful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the labors of the mind have not affected the health of the body, I
      trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the slightest degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your strength is as great as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too great, my friend, too great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I had heard that, for a short time after your arrival&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I could hardly move a limb, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, smiling, &ldquo;and why was it you could not
      move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, perceiving that he had made a mistake, wished to correct it.
      &ldquo;Yes, I came from Belle-Isle upon very hard horses,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that
      fatigued me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no longer astonished, then, since I, who followed you, found seven
      or eight lying dead on the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very heavy, you know,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you were bruised all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My marrow melted, and that made me very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Porthos! But how did Aramis act towards you under those
      circumstances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, indeed. He had me attended to by M. Fouquet&rsquo;s own doctor. But
      just imagine, at the end of a week I could not breathe any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room was too small; I had absorbed every atom of air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told so, at least; and so I was removed into another apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you were able to breathe, I hope and trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, more freely; but no exercise&mdash;nothing to do. The doctor
      pretended that I was not to stir; I, on the contrary, felt that I was
      stronger than ever; that was the cause of a very serious accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy, my dear fellow, that I revolted against the directions of that ass
      of a doctor, and I resolved to go out, whether it suited him or not: and,
      consequently, I told the valet who waited on me to bring me my clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite naked, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! on the contrary, I had a magnificent dressing-gown to wear. The
      lackey obeyed; I dressed myself in my own clothes, which had become too
      large for me; but a strange circumstance had happened,&mdash;my feet had
      become too large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my boots too small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean your feet were still swollen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; you have hit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> And is that the accident you were going to tell me
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I did not make the same reflection you have done. I said to
      myself: &lsquo;Since my feet have entered my boots ten times, there is no reason
      why they should not go in the eleventh.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to tell you, my dear Porthos, that on this occasion you failed
      in your logic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short, then, they placed me opposite to a part of the room which was
      partitioned; I tried to get my boot on; I pulled it with my hands, I
      pushed with all the strength of the muscles of my leg, making the most
      unheard-of efforts, when suddenly the two tags of my boot remained in my
      hands, and my foot struck out like a ballista.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How learned you are in fortification, dear Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My foot darted out like a ballista, and came against the partition, which
      it broke in; I really thought that, like Samson, I had demolished the
      temple. And the number of pictures, the quantity of china, vases of
      flowers, carpets, and window-panes that fell down were really wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without reckoning that on the other side of the partition was a small
      table laden with porcelain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you knocked over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I dashed to the other side of the room,&rdquo; said Porthos, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, it is, as you say, astonishing,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      beginning to laugh also; whereupon Porthos laughed louder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I broke,&rdquo; said Porthos, in a voice half-choked from his increasing mirth,
      &ldquo;more than three thousand francs worth of china&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I smashed more than four thousand francs worth of glass!&mdash;ho, ho,
      ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without counting a luster, which fell on my head and was broken into a
      thousand pieces&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon your head?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, holding his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your head was broken, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, since I tell you, on the contrary, my dear fellow, that it was the
      luster which was broken, like glass, which, in point of fact, it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the luster was glass, you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Venetian glass! a perfect curiosity, quite matchless, indeed, and weighed
      two hundred pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it fell upon your head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my head. Just imagine, a globe of crystal, gilded all over, the
      lower part beautifully encrusted, perfumes burning at the top, with jets
      from which flame issued when they were lighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand, but they were not lighted at the time, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happily not, or I should have been grilled prematurely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were only knocked down flat, instead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, &lsquo;not at all?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the luster fell on my skull. It appears that we have upon the top of
      our heads an exceedingly thick crust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that, Porthos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor. A sort of dome which would bear Notre-Dame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it seems that our skulls are made in that manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself, my dear fellow, it is your own skull that is made in
      that manner, and not the skulls of other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that may be so,&rdquo; said Porthos, conceitedly, &ldquo;so much, however, was
      that the case, in my instance, that no sooner did the luster fall upon the
      dome which we have at the top of our head, than there was a report like a
      cannon, the crystal was broken to pieces, and I fell, covered from head to
      foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With blood, poor Porthos!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; with perfumes, which smelt like rich creams; it was
      delicious, but the odor was too strong, and I felt quite giddy from it;
      perhaps you have experienced it sometimes yourself, D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in inhaling the scent of the lily of the valley; so that, my poor
      friend, you were knocked over by the shock and overpowered by the
      perfumes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but what is very remarkable, for the doctor told me he had never
      seen anything like it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a bump on your head I suppose?&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why five?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you; the luster had, at its lower extremity, five gilt
      ornaments; excessively sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, these five ornaments penetrated my hair, which, as you see, I wear
      very thick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they made a mark on my skin. But just notice the singularity of it,
      these things seem really only to happen to me! Instead of making
      indentations, they made bumps. The doctor could never succeed in
      explaining that to me satisfactorily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will explain it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do me a great service if you will,&rdquo; said Porthos, winking his
      eyes, which, with him, was sign of the profoundest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have been employing your brain in studies of an exalted
      character, in important calculations, and so on, the head has gained a
      certain advantage, so that your head is now too full of science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it. The result is, that, instead of allowing any foreign
      matter to penetrate the interior of the head, your bony box or skull,
      which is already too full, avails itself of the openings which are made in
      allowing this excess to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Porthos, to whom this explanation appeared clearer than that of
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The five protuberances, caused by the five ornaments of the luster, must
      certainly have been scientific globules, brought to the surface by the
      force of circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;the real truth is, that I felt far worse outside
      my head than inside. I will even confess, that when I put my hat upon my
      head, clapping it on my head with that graceful energy which we gentlemen
      of the sword possess, if my fist was not very gently applied, I
      experienced the most painful sensations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite believe you, Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, my friend,&rdquo; said the giant, &ldquo;M. Fouquet decided, seeing how
      slightly built the house was, to give me another lodging, and so they
      brought me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the private park, I think, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the rendezvous are made; that park, indeed, which is so celebrated
      in some of those mysterious stories about the superintendent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I have had no rendezvous or heard mysterious stories
      myself, but they have authorized me to exercise my muscles, and I take
      advantage of the permission by rooting up some of the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep my hand in, and also to take some birds&rsquo; nests; I find it more
      convenient than climbing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as pastoral as Tyrcis, my dear Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I like the small eggs; I like them very much better than larger
      ones. You have no idea how delicate an <i>omelette</i> is, if made of four
      or five hundred eggs of linnets, chaffinches, starlings, blackbirds, and
      thrushes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But five hundred eggs is perfectly monstrous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A salad-bowl will hold them easily enough,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan looked at Porthos admiringly for full five minutes, as if he
      had seen him for the first time, while Porthos spread his chest out
      joyously and proudly. They remained in this state several minutes, Porthos
      smiling, and D&rsquo;Artagnan looking at him. D&rsquo;Artagnan was evidently trying to
      give the conversation a new turn. &ldquo;Do you amuse yourself much here,
      Porthos?&rdquo; he asked at last, very likely after he had found out what he was
      searching for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can imagine that; but when you get thoroughly bored, by and by, what do
      you intend to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shall not be here for any length of time. Aramis is waiting until
      the last bump on my head disappears, in order to present me to the king,
      who I am told cannot endure the sight of a bump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis is still in Paris, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereabouts is he, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. But do you happen to know one thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, tell it me, and then I shall know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I think Aramis is forgetting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for at Fontainebleau yonder, you must know, they are laughing,
      dancing, banqueting, and drawing the corks of M. de Mazarin&rsquo;s wine in fine
      style. Are you aware that they have a ballet every evening there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce they have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you that your dear Aramis is forgetting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is not at all unlikely, and I have myself thought so
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless he is playing you a trick, the sly fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that Aramis is as sly as a fox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but to play <i>me</i> a trick&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen: in the first place, he puts you under a sort of sequestration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sequestrates me! Do you mean to say I am sequestrated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would have the goodness to prove that to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing easier. Do you ever go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever ride on horseback?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your friends allowed to come and see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; never to go out, never to ride on horseback, never to be
      allowed to see your friends, that is called being sequestrated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should Aramis sequestrate me?&rdquo; inquired Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;be frank, Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Aramis who drew the plan of the fortifications at Belle-Isle, was
      it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos colored as he said, &ldquo;Yes; but that was all he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, and my own opinion is that it was no very great affair after
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is mine, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; I am delighted we are of the same opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never even came to Belle-Isle,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I who went to Vannes, as you may have seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather, as I did see. Well, that is precisely the state of the case,
      my dear Porthos. Aramis, who only drew the plans, wishes to pass himself
      off as the engineer, whilst you, who, stone by stone, built the wall, the
      citadel, and the bastions, he wishes to reduce to the rank of a mere
      builder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By builder, you mean mason, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mason; the very word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plasterer, in fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hodman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh! my dear Aramis, you seem to think you are only five and twenty
      years of age still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that is not all, for he believes you are fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have amazingly liked to have seen him at work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fellow who has got the gout?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has lost three of his teeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I, look at mine.&rdquo; And Porthos, opening his large mouth very wide,
      displayed two rows of teeth not quite as white as snow, but even, hard,
      and sound as ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hardly believe, Porthos,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;what a fancy the king
      has for good teeth. Yours decide me; I will present you to the king
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Do you think I have less credit at court than Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I have the slightest pretensions upon the fortifications at
      Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your own interest alone which would induce me to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am the intimate friend of the king; and a proof of that is, that
      whenever there is anything disagreeable to tell him, it is I who have to
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear D&rsquo;Artagnan, if you present me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis will be angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, with <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! whether he or I present you, since you are to be presented, what
      does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were going to get me some clothes made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own are splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! those I had ordered were far more beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care: the king likes simplicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I will be simple. But what will M. Fouquet say, when he
      learns that I have left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a prisoner, then, on parole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not quite that. But I promised him I would not leave without letting
      him know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, we shall return to that presently. Have you anything to do
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, nothing: nothing of any importance, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless, indeed, you are Aramis&rsquo;s representative for something of
      importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I tell you&mdash;pray, understand that&mdash;is out of interest for
      you. I suppose, for instance, that you are commissioned to send messages
      and letters to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! letters&mdash;yes. I send certain letters to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any letters, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, let me speak. Have you any letters, I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just received one for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interesting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not read them, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all curious,&rdquo; said Porthos, as he drew out of his pocket the
      soldier&rsquo;s letter which Porthos had not read, but D&rsquo;Artagnan had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what to do with it?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; do as I always do, send it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Keep it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they not tell you that this letter was important?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must take it yourself to Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Aramis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And since the king is there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will profit by that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall profit by the opportunity to present you to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! D&rsquo;Artagnan, there is no one like you for expedients.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, instead of forwarding to our friend any messages, which may or
      may not be faithfully delivered, we will ourselves be the bearers of the
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had never even thought of that, and yet it is simple enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore, because it is urgent, Porthos, we ought to set off at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;the sooner we set off the less chance there is
      of Aramis&rsquo;s letter being delayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos, your reasoning is always accurate, and, in your case, logic
      seems to serve as an auxiliary to the imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the result of your hard reading,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;So come
      along, let us be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;my promise to M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to leave Saint-Mande without telling him of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Porthos,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;how very young you still are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to Fontainebleau, are you not, where you will find M.
      Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably in the king&rsquo;s palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated Porthos, with an air full of majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will accost him with these words: &lsquo;M. Fouquet, I have the honor
      to inform you that I have just left Saint-Mande.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Porthos, with the same majestic mien, &ldquo;seeing me at
      Fontainebleau at the king&rsquo;s, M. Fouquet will not be able to tell me I am
      not speaking the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Porthos, I was just on the point of opening my lips to make the
      same remark, but you anticipate me in everything. Oh! Porthos, how
      fortunately you are gifted! Years have made not the slightest impression
      on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not over-much, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is nothing more to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All your scruples are removed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I shall carry you off with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; and I will go and get my horse saddled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have horses here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had them sent from Pierrefonds, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, M. Fouquet gave them to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Porthos, we shall not want five horses for two persons; besides,
      I have already three in Paris, which would make eight, and that will be
      too many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be too many if I had some of my servants here; but, alas! I
      have not got them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you regret them, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret Mousqueton; I miss Mousqueton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a good-hearted fellow you are, Porthos,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;but the
      best thing you can do is to leave your horses here, as you have left
      Mousqueton out yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, by and by, it might turn out a very good thing if M. Fouquet had
      never given you anything at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary you should understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain to you later, Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager it is some piece of policy or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of the most subtle character,&rdquo; returned D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos nodded his head at this word policy; then, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection, he added, &ldquo;I confess, D&rsquo;Artagnan, that I am no politician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no one knows what you told me yourself, you, the bravest of the
      brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you, Porthos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That every man has his day. You told me so, and I have experienced it
      myself. There are certain days when one feels less pleasure than others in
      exposing one&rsquo;s self to a bullet or a sword-thrust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly my own idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine, too, although I can hardly believe in blows or thrusts that
      kill outright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! and yet you have killed a few in your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I have never been killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reason is a very good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, I do not believe I shall ever die from a thrust of a sword or
      a gun-shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, then, you are afraid of nothing. Ah! water, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I swim like an otter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a quartan fever, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had one yet, and I don&rsquo;t believe I ever shall; but there is
      one thing I will admit,&rdquo; and Porthos dropped his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Artagnan, adopting the same tone of voice as
      Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess,&rdquo; repeated Porthos, &ldquo;that I am horribly afraid of
      politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Porthos, in a stentorian voice. &ldquo;I have
      seen his eminence Monsieur le Cardinal de Richelieu, and his eminence
      Monsieur le Cardinal de Mazarin; the one was a red politician, the other a
      black politician; I never felt very much more satisfied with the one than
      with the other; the first struck off the heads of M. de Marillac, M. de
      Thou, M. de Cinq-Mars, M. Chalais, M. de Bouteville, and M. de
      Montmorency; the second got a whole crowd of Frondeurs cut in pieces, and
      we belonged to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, we did not belong to them,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! indeed, yes; for if I unsheathed my sword for the cardinal, I struck
      it for the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good Porthos!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have done. My dread of politics is such, that if there is any
      question of politics in the matter, I should greatly prefer to return to
      Pierrefonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be quite right, if that were the case. But with me, my dear
      Porthos, no politics at all, that is quite clear. You have labored hard in
      fortifying Belle-Isle; the king wished to know the name of the clever
      engineer under whose directions the works were carried out; you are
      modest, as all men of true genius are; perhaps Aramis wishes to put you
      under a bushel. But I happen to seize hold of you; I make it known who you
      are; I produce you; the king rewards you; and that is the only policy I
      have to do with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the only one I will have to do with either,&rdquo; said Porthos, holding
      out his hand to D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      But D&rsquo;Artagnan knew Porthos&rsquo;s grasp; he knew that, once imprisoned within
      the baron&rsquo;s five fingers, no hand ever left it without being half-crushed.
      He therefore held out, not his hand, but his fist, and Porthos did not
      even perceive the difference. The servants talked a little with each other
      in an undertone, and whispered a few words, which D&rsquo;Artagnan understood,
      but which he took very good care not to let Porthos understand. &ldquo;Our
      friend,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;was really and truly Aramis&rsquo;s prisoner. Let
      us now see what the result will be of the liberation of the captive.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter IV. The Rat and the Cheese.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan and Porthos returned on foot, as D&rsquo;Artagnan had set out. When
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he entered the shop of the Pilon d&rsquo;Or, announced to
      Planchet that M. du Vallon would be one of the privileged travelers, and
      as the plume in Porthos&rsquo;s hat made the wooden candles suspended over the
      front jingle together, a melancholy presentiment seemed to eclipse the
      delight Planchet had promised himself for the morrow. But the grocer had a
      heart of gold, ever mindful of the good old times&mdash;a trait that
      carries youth into old age. So Planchet, notwithstanding a sort of
      internal shiver, checked as soon as experienced, received Porthos with
      respect, mingled with the tenderest cordiality. Porthos, who was a little
      cold and stiff in his manners at first, on account of the social
      difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer, soon
      began to soften when he perceived so much good-feeling and so many kind
      attentions in Planchet. He was particularly touched by the liberty which
      was permitted him to plunge his great palms into the boxes of dried fruits
      and preserves, into the sacks of nuts and almonds, and into the drawers
      full of sweetmeats. So that, notwithstanding Planchet&rsquo;s pressing
      invitations to go upstairs to the <i>entresol</i>, he chose as his
      favorite seat, during the evening which he had to spend at Planchet&rsquo;s
      house, the shop itself, where his fingers could always fish up whatever
      his nose detected. The delicious figs from Provence, filberts from the
      forest, Tours plums, were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five
      consecutive hours. His teeth, like millstones, cracked heaps of nuts, the
      shells of which were scattered all over the floor, where they were
      trampled by every one who went in and out of the shop; Porthos pulled from
      the stalk with his lips, at one mouthful, bunches of the rich Muscatel
      raisins with their beautiful bloom, half a pound of which passed at one
      gulp from his mouth to his stomach. In one of the corners of the shop,
      Planchet&rsquo;s assistants, huddled together, looked at each other without
      venturing to open their lips. They did not know who Porthos was, for they
      had never seen him before. The race of those Titans who had worn the
      cuirasses of Hugh Capet, Philip Augustus, and Francis I. had already begun
      to disappear. They could hardly help thinking he might be the ogre of the
      fairy tale, who was going to turn the whole contents of Planchet&rsquo;s shop
      into his insatiable stomach, and that, too, without in the slightest
      degree displacing the barrels and chests that were in it. Cracking,
      munching, chewing, nibbling, sucking, and swallowing, Porthos occasionally
      said to the grocer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do a very good business here, friend Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will very soon have none at all to do, if this sort of thing
      continues,&rdquo; grumbled the foreman, who had Planchet&rsquo;s word that he should
      be his successor. In the midst of his despair, he approached Porthos, who
      blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to the shop
      itself. He hoped that Porthos would rise and that this movement would
      distract his devouring ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, my man?&rdquo; asked Porthos, affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to pass you, monsieur, if it is not troubling you too
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;it does not trouble me in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband,
      lifted him off the ground, and placed him very gently on the other side,
      smiling all the while with the same affable expression. As soon as Porthos
      had placed him on the ground, the lad&rsquo;s legs so shook under him that he
      fell back upon some sacks of corks. But noticing the giant&rsquo;s gentleness of
      manner, he ventured again, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, monsieur! pray be careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; inquired Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are positively putting a fiery furnace into your body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that, my good fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All those things are very heating to the system!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raisins, nuts, and almonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but if raisins, nuts, and almonds are heating&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt at all of it, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honey is very cooling,&rdquo; said Porthos, stretching out his hand toward a
      small barrel of honey which was open, and he plunged the scoop with which
      the wants of the customers were supplied into it, and swallowed a good
      half-pound at one gulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must trouble you for some water now, my man,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a pail, monsieur?&rdquo; asked the lad, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, in a water-bottle; that will be quite enough;&rdquo; and raising the bottle
      to his mouth, as a trumpeter does his trumpet, he emptied the bottle at a
      single draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planchet was agitated in every fibre of propriety and self-esteem.
      However, a worthy representative of the hospitality which prevailed in
      early days, he feigned to be talking very earnestly with D&rsquo;Artagnan, and
      incessantly repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! monsieur, what a happiness! what an
      honor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time shall we have supper, Planchet?&rdquo; inquired Porthos, &ldquo;I feel
      hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreman clasped his hands together. The two others got under the
      counters, fearing Porthos might have a taste for human flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall only take a sort of snack here,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;and when we
      get to Planchet&rsquo;s country-seat, we will have supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah! so we are going to your country-house, Planchet,&rdquo; said Porthos;
      &ldquo;so much the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overwhelm me, monsieur le baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;monsieur le baron&rdquo; had a great effect upon the men, who detected a
      personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind. This title,
      too, reassured them. They had never heard that an ogre was ever called
      &ldquo;monsieur le baron&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take a few biscuits to eat on the road,&rdquo; said Porthos, carelessly;
      and he emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge pocket of his
      doublet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My shop is saved!&rdquo; exclaimed Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as the cheese was,&rdquo; whispered the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cheese?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dutch cheese, inside which a rat had made his way, and we found only
      the rind left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planchet looked all round his shop, and observing the different articles
      which had escaped Porthos&rsquo;s teeth, he found the comparison somewhat
      exaggerated. The foreman, who remarked what was passing in his master&rsquo;s
      mind, said, &ldquo;Take care; he is not gone yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any fruit here?&rdquo; said Porthos, as he went upstairs to the <i>entresol</i>,
      where it had just been announced that some refreshment was prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; thought the grocer, addressing a look at D&rsquo;Artagnan full of
      entreaty, which the latter half understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they had finished eating they set off. It was late when the
      three riders, who had left Paris about six in the evening, arrived at
      Fontainebleau. The journey passed very agreeably. Porthos took a fancy to
      Planchet&rsquo;s society, because the latter was very respectful in his manners,
      and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows, his woods, and his
      rabbit-warrens. Porthos had all the taste and pride of a landed
      proprietor. When D&rsquo;Artagnan saw his two companions in earnest
      conversation, he took the opposite side of the road, and letting his
      bridle drop upon his horse&rsquo;s neck, separated himself from the whole world,
      as he had done from Porthos and from Planchet. The moon shone softly
      through the foliage of the forest. The breezes of the open country rose
      deliciously perfumed to the horse&rsquo;s nostrils, and they snorted and pranced
      along delightedly. Porthos and Planchet began to talk about hay-crops.
      Planchet admitted to Porthos that in the advanced years of his life, he
      had certainly neglected agricultural pursuits for commerce, but that his
      childhood had been passed in Picardy in the beautiful meadows where the
      grass grew as high as the knees, and where he had played under the green
      apple-trees covered with red-cheeked fruit; he went on to say, that he had
      solemnly promised himself that as soon as he should have made his fortune,
      he would return to nature, and end his days, as he had begun them, as near
      as he possibly could to the earth itself, where all men must sleep at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, eh!&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;in that case, my dear Monsieur Planchet, your
      retirement is not far distant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we are getting on pretty well, I must admit,&rdquo; replied Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, tell me what is the extent of your ambition, and what is the amount
      you intend to retire upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one circumstance, monsieur,&rdquo; said Planchet, without answering
      the question, &ldquo;which occasions me a good deal of anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Porthos, looking all round him as if in search of
      the circumstance that annoyed Planchet, and desirous of freeing him from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, formerly,&rdquo; said the grocer, &ldquo;you used to call me Planchet quite
      short, and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar manner
      than you do now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly, I should have said so formerly,&rdquo; replied the
      good-natured Porthos, with an embarrassment full of delicacy; &ldquo;but
      formerly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Formerly I was M. d&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s lackey; is not that what you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well if I am not quite his lackey, I am as much as ever I was his devoted
      servant; and more than that, since that time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Planchet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that time, I have had the honor of being in partnership with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;What, has D&rsquo;Artagnan gone into the grocery
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, whom these words had drawn out of his reverie,
      and who entered into the conversation with that readiness and rapidity
      which distinguished every operation of his mind and body. &ldquo;It was not
      D&rsquo;Artagnan who entered into the grocery business, but Planchet who entered
      into a political affair with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Planchet, with mingled pride and satisfaction, &ldquo;we transacted
      a little business which brought me in a hundred thousand francs and M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan two hundred thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; said Porthos, with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that, monsieur le baron,&rdquo; continued the grocer, &ldquo;I again beg you to be
      kind enough to call me Planchet, as you used to do; and to speak to me as
      familiarly as in old times. You cannot possibly imagine the pleasure it
      would give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be the case, my dear Planchet, I will do so, certainly,&rdquo; replied
      Porthos. And as he was quite close to Planchet, he raised his hand, as if
      to strike him on the shoulder, in token of friendly cordiality; but a
      fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim, so that his hand
      fell on the crupper of Planchet&rsquo;s horse, instead; which made the animal&rsquo;s
      legs almost give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan burst out laughing, as he said, &ldquo;Take care, Planchet; for if
      Porthos begins to like you so much, he will caress you, and if he caresses
      you he will knock you as flat as a pancake. Porthos is still as strong as
      ever, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Planchet, &ldquo;Mousqueton is not dead, and yet monsieur le baron is
      very fond of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Porthos, with a sigh which made all the three horses
      rear; &ldquo;and I was only saying, this very morning, to D&rsquo;Artagnan, how much I
      regretted him. But tell me, Planchet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, monsieur le baron, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good lad, good lad! How many acres of park have you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of park?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we will reckon up the meadows presently, and the woods afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereabouts, monsieur?&rdquo; &ldquo;At your chateau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur le baron, I have neither chateau, nor park, nor meadows, nor
      woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got, then?&rdquo; inquired Porthos, &ldquo;and why do you call it a
      country-seat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not call it a country-seat, monsieur le baron,&rdquo; replied Planchet,
      somewhat humiliated, &ldquo;but a country-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah! I understand. You are modest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur le baron, I speak the plain truth. I have rooms for a couple
      of friends, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in that case, whereabouts do your friends walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, they can walk about the king&rsquo;s forest, which is very
      beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know the forest is very fine,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;nearly as beautiful
      as my forest at Berry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planchet opened his eyes very wide. &ldquo;Have you a forest of the same kind as
      the forest at Fontainebleau, monsieur le baron?&rdquo; he stammered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have two, indeed, but the one at Berry is my favorite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t know where it ends; and, also, because it is full of
      poachers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can the poachers make the forest so agreeable to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they hunt my game, and I hunt them&mdash;which, in these peaceful
      times, is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small scale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached this turn of conversation, when Planchet, looking up,
      perceived the houses at the commencement of Fontainebleau, the lofty
      outlines of which stood out strongly against the misty visage of the
      heavens; whilst, rising above the compact and irregularly formed mass of
      buildings, the pointed roofs of the chateau were clearly visible, the
      slates of which glistened beneath the light of the moon, like the scales
      of an immense fish. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Planchet, &ldquo;I have the honor to
      inform you that we have arrived at Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter V. Planchet&rsquo;s Country-House.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cavaliers looked up, and saw that what Planchet had announced to them
      was true. Ten minutes afterwards they were in the street called the Rue de
      Lyon, on the opposite side of the hostelry of the Beau Paon. A high hedge
      of bushy elders, hawthorn, and wild hops formed an impenetrable fence,
      behind which rose a white house, with a high tiled roof. Two of the
      windows, which were quite dark, looked upon the street. Between the two, a
      small door, with a porch supported by a couple of pillars, formed the
      entrance to the house. The door was gained by a step raised a little from
      the ground. Planchet got off his horse, as if he intended to knock at the
      door; but, on second thoughts, he took hold of his horse by the bridle,
      and led it about thirty paces further on, his two companions following
      him. He then advanced about another thirty paces, until he arrived at the
      door of a cart-house, lighted by an iron grating; and, lifting up a wooden
      latch, pushed open one of the folding-doors. He entered first, leading his
      horse after him by the bridle, into a small courtyard, where an odor met
      them which revealed their close vicinity to a stable. &ldquo;That smells all
      right,&rdquo; said Porthos, loudly, getting off his horse, &ldquo;and I almost begin
      to think I am near my own cows at Pierrefonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one cow,&rdquo; Planchet hastened to say modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have thirty,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;or rather, I don&rsquo;t exactly know how
      many I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the two cavaliers had entered, Planchet fastened the door behind
      them. In the meantime, D&rsquo;Artagnan, who had dismounted with his usual
      agility, inhaled the fresh perfumed air with the delight a Parisian feels
      at the sight of green fields and fresh foliage, plucked a piece of
      honeysuckle with one hand, and of sweet-briar with the other. Porthos
      clawed hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into the
      ground, and ate, or rather browsed upon them, shells and all: and Planchet
      was busily engaged trying to wake up an old and infirm peasant, who was
      fast asleep in a shed, lying on a bed of moss, and dressed in an old
      stable suit of clothes. The peasant, recognizing Planchet, called him &ldquo;the
      master,&rdquo; to the grocer&rsquo;s great satisfaction. &ldquo;Stable the horses well, old
      fellow, and you shall have something good for yourself,&rdquo; said Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; fine animals they are too,&rdquo; said the peasant. &ldquo;Oh! they shall
      have as much as they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, gently, my man,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;we are getting on a little too
      fast. A few oats and a good bed&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some bran and water for my horse,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;for it is very warm, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied Planchet; &ldquo;Daddy Celestin is an old
      gendarme, who fought at Ivry. He knows all about horses; so come into the
      house.&rdquo; And he led the way along a well-sheltered walk, which crossed a
      kitchen-garden, then a small paddock, and came out into a little garden
      behind the house, the principal front of which, as we have already
      noticed, faced the street. As they approached, they could see, through two
      open windows on the ground floor, which led into a sitting-room, the
      interior of Planchet&rsquo;s residence. This room, softly lighted by a lamp
      placed on the table, seemed, from the end of the garden, like a smiling
      image of repose, comfort, and happiness. In every direction where the rays
      of light fell, whether upon a piece of old china, or upon an article of
      furniture shining from excessive neatness, or upon the weapons hanging
      against the wall, the soft light was softly reflected; and its rays seemed
      to linger everywhere upon something or another, agreeable to the eye. The
      lamp which lighted the room, whilst the foliage of jasmine and climbing
      roses hung in masses from the window-frames, splendidly illuminated a
      damask table-cloth as white as snow. The table was laid for two persons.
      Amber-colored wine sparkled in a long cut-glass bottle; and a large jug of
      blue china, with a silver lid, was filled with foaming cider. Near the
      table, in a high-backed armchair, reclined, fast asleep, a woman of about
      thirty years of age, her face the very picture of health and freshness.
      Upon her knees lay a large cat, with her paws folded under her, and her
      eyes half-closed, purring in that significant manner which, according to
      feline habits, indicates perfect contentment. The two friends paused
      before the window in complete amazement, while Planchet, perceiving their
      astonishment, was in no little degree secretly delighted at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Planchet, you rascal,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I now understand your
      absences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh! there is some white linen!&rdquo; said Porthos, in his turn, in a voice
      of thunder. At the sound of this gigantic voice, the cat took flight, the
      housekeeper woke up with a start, and Planchet, assuming a gracious air,
      introduced his two companions into the room, where the table was already
      laid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to present to you Monsieur le Chevalier
      d&rsquo;Artagnan, my patron.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan took the lady&rsquo;s hand in his in the most
      courteous manner, and with precisely the same chivalrous air as he would
      have taken Madame&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,&rdquo; added Planchet.
      Porthos bowed with a reverence which Anne of Austria would have approved
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then Planchet&rsquo;s turn, and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady in
      question, not, however, until he had made a sign as if requesting
      D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s and Porthos&rsquo;s permission, a permission as a matter of course
      frankly conceded. D&rsquo;Artagnan complimented Planchet, and said, &ldquo;You are
      indeed a man who knows how to make life agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life, monsieur,&rdquo; said Planchet, laughing, &ldquo;is capital which a man ought
      to invest as sensibly as he possibly can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you get very good interest for yours,&rdquo; said Porthos, with a burst of
      laughter like a peal of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planchet turned to his housekeeper. &ldquo;You have before you,&rdquo; he said to her,
      &ldquo;the two gentlemen who influenced the greatest, gayest, grandest portion
      of my life. I have spoken to you about them both very frequently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about two others as well,&rdquo; said the lady, with a very decided Flemish
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is Dutch?&rdquo; inquired D&rsquo;Artagnan. Porthos curled his mustache, a
      circumstance which was not lost upon D&rsquo;Artagnan, who noticed everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am from Antwerp,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her name is Madame Getcher,&rdquo; said Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not call her madame,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it would make her seem older every time you call her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I call her Truchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very pretty name too,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truchen,&rdquo; said Planchet, &ldquo;came to me from Flanders with her virtue and
      two thousand florins. She ran away from a brute of a husband who was in
      the habit of beating her. Being myself a Picard born, I was always very
      fond of the Artesian women, and it is only a step from Artois to Flanders;
      she came crying bitterly to her godfather, my predecessor in the Rue des
      Lombards; she placed her two thousand florins in my establishment, which I
      have turned to very good account, and which have brought her in ten
      thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Planchet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is free and well off; she has a cow, a maid servant and old Celestin
      at her orders; she mends my linen, knits my winter stockings; she only
      sees me every fortnight, and seems to make herself in all things tolerably
      happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And indeed, gentlemen, I <i>am</i> very happy and comfortable,&rdquo; said
      Truchen, with perfect ingenuousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos began to curl the other side of his mustache. &ldquo;The deuce,&rdquo; thought
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;can Porthos have any intentions in that quarter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Truchen had set her cook to work, had laid the table for
      two more, and covered it with every possible delicacy that could convert a
      light supper into a substantial meal, a meal into a regular feast. Fresh
      butter, salt beef, anchovies, tunny, a shopful of Planchet&rsquo;s commodities,
      fowls, vegetables, salad, fish from the pond and the river, game from the
      forest&mdash;all the produce, in fact, of the province. Moreover, Planchet
      returned from the cellar, laden with ten bottles of wine, the glass of
      which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of dust which covered
      them. Porthos&rsquo;s heart began to expand as he said, &ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; and he
      sat himself beside Madame Truchen, whom he looked at in the most killing
      manner. D&rsquo;Artagnan seated himself on the other side of her, while
      Planchet, discreetly and full of delight, took his seat opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble yourselves,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if Truchen should leave the table
      now and then during supper; for she will have to look after your
      bedrooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently, and they could
      hear, on the first floor above them, the creaking of the wooden bedsteads
      and the rolling of the castors on the floor. While this was going on, the
      three men, Porthos especially, ate and drank gloriously,&mdash;it was
      wonderful to see them. The ten full bottles were ten empty ones by the
      time Truchen returned with the cheese. D&rsquo;Artagnan still preserved his
      dignity and self-possession, but Porthos had lost a portion of his; and
      the mirth soon began to grow somewhat uproarious. D&rsquo;Artagnan recommended a
      new descent into the cellar, and, as Planchet no longer walked with the
      steadiness of a well-trained foot-soldier, the captain of the musketeers
      proposed to accompany him. They set off, humming songs wild enough to
      frighten anybody who might be listening. Truchen remained behind at table
      with Porthos. While the two wine-bibbers were looking behind the firewood
      for what they wanted, a sharp report was heard like the impact of a pair
      of lips on a lady&rsquo;s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos fancies himself at La Rochelle,&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan, as they
      returned freighted with bottles. Planchet was singing so loudly that he
      was incapable of noticing anything. D&rsquo;Artagnan, whom nothing ever escaped,
      remarked how much redder Truchen&rsquo;s left cheek was than her right. Porthos
      was sitting on Truchen&rsquo;s left, and was curling with both his hands both
      sides of his mustache at once, and Truchen was looking at him with a most
      bewitching smile. The sparkling wine of Anjou very soon produced a
      remarkable effect upon the three companions. D&rsquo;Artagnan had hardly
      strength enough left to take a candlestick to light Planchet up his own
      staircase. Planchet was pulling Porthos along, who was following Truchen,
      who was herself jovial enough. It was D&rsquo;Artagnan who found out the rooms
      and the beds. Porthos threw himself into the one destined for him, after
      his friend had undressed him. D&rsquo;Artagnan got into his own bed, saying to
      himself, &ldquo;<i>Mordioux!</i> I had made up my mind never to touch that
      light-colored wine, which brings my early camp days back again. Fie! fie!
      if my musketeers were only to see their captain in such a state.&rdquo; And
      drawing the curtains of his bed, he added, &ldquo;Fortunately enough, though,
      they will not see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country is very amusing,&rdquo; said Porthos, stretching out his legs,
      which passed through the wooden footboard, and made a tremendous crash, of
      which, however, no one in the house was capable of taking the slightest
      notice. By two o&rsquo;clock in the morning every one was fast asleep.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI. Showing What Could Be Seen from Planchet&rsquo;s House.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning found the three heroes sleeping soundly. Truchen had
      closed the outside blinds to keep the first rays of the sun from the
      leaden-lidded eyes of her guests, like a kind, good housekeeper. It was
      still perfectly dark, then, beneath Porthos&rsquo;s curtains and under
      Planchet&rsquo;s canopy, when D&rsquo;Artagnan, awakened by an indiscreet ray of light
      which made its way through a peek-hole in the shutters, jumped hastily out
      of bed, as if he wished to be the first at a forlorn hope. He took by
      assault Porthos&rsquo;s room, which was next to his own. The worthy Porthos was
      sleeping with a noise like distant thunder; in the dim obscurity of the
      room his gigantic frame was prominently displayed, and his swollen fist
      hung down outside the bed upon the carpet. D&rsquo;Artagnan awoke Porthos, who
      rubbed his eyes in a tolerably good humor. In the meantime Planchet was
      dressing himself, and met at their bedroom doors his two guests, who were
      still somewhat unsteady from their previous evening&rsquo;s entertainment.
      Although it was yet very early, the whole household was already up. The
      cook was mercilessly slaughtering in the poultry-yard; Celestin was
      gathering white cherries in the garden. Porthos, brisk and lively as ever,
      held out his hand to Planchet&rsquo;s, and D&rsquo;Artagnan requested permission to
      embrace Madame Truchen. The latter, to show that she bore no ill-will,
      approached Porthos, upon whom she conferred the same favor. Porthos
      embraced Madame Truchen, heaving an enormous sigh. Planchet took both his
      friends by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to show you over the house,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;when we arrived last
      night it was as dark as an oven, and we were unable to see anything; but
      in broad daylight, everything looks different, and you will be satisfied,
      I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we begin by the view you have here,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;that charms me
      beyond everything; I have always lived in royal mansions, you know, and
      royal personages have tolerably sound ideas upon the selection of points
      of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a great stickler for a good view myself,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;At my
      Chateau de Pierrefonds, I have had four avenues laid out, and at the end
      of each is a landscape of an altogether different character from the
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see <i>my</i> prospect,&rdquo; said Planchet; and he led his two
      guests to a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;this is the Rue de Lyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have two windows on this side, a paltry, insignificant view, for
      there is always that bustling and noisy inn, which is a very disagreeable
      neighbor. I had four windows here, but I bricked up two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered a corridor leading to the bedrooms, and Planchet pushed open
      the outside blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hollo! what is that out yonder?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The forest,&rdquo; said Planchet. &ldquo;It is the horizon,&mdash;a thick line of
      green, which is yellow in the spring, green in the summer, red in the
      autumn, and white in the winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All very well, but it is like a curtain, which prevents one seeing a
      greater distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Planchet; &ldquo;still, one can see, at all events, everything that
      intervenes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the open country,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;But what is that I see out there,&mdash;crosses
      and stones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is the cemetery,&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Planchet; &ldquo;I assure you it is very curious. Hardly a day
      passes that some one is not buried there; for Fontainebleau is by no means
      an inconsiderable place. Sometimes we see young girls clothed in white
      carrying banners; at others, some of the town-council, or rich citizens,
      with choristers and all the parish authorities; and then, too, we see some
      of the officers of the king&rsquo;s household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not like that,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not much amusement in it, at all events,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you it encourages religious thoughts,&rdquo; replied Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Planchet, &ldquo;we must all die one day or another, and I once
      met with a maxim somewhere which I have remembered, that the thought of
      death is a thought that will do us all good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am far from saying the contrary,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;the thought of green fields, flowers, rivers,
      blue horizons, extensive and boundless plains, is not likely to do us
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had any, I should be far from rejecting them,&rdquo; said Planchet; &ldquo;but
      possessing only this little cemetery, full of flowers, so moss-grown,
      shady, and quiet, I am contented with it, and I think of those who live in
      town, in the Rue des Lombards, for instance, and who have to listen to the
      rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every day, and to the soulless
      tramp, tramp, tramp of a hundred and fifty thousand foot-passengers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But living,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;living, remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly the reason,&rdquo; said Planchet, timidly, &ldquo;why I feel it does
      me good to contemplate a few dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;that fellow Planchet is born a
      philosopher as well as a grocer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Planchet, &ldquo;I am one of those good-humored sort of men
      whom Heaven created for the purpose of living a certain span of days, and
      of considering all good they meet with during their transitory stay on
      earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan sat down close to the window, and as there seemed to be
      something substantial in Planchet&rsquo;s philosophy, he mused over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Planchet, &ldquo;if I am not mistaken, we are going to have
      a representation now, for I think I heard something like chanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I hear singing too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is only a burial of a very poor description,&rdquo; said Planchet,
      disdainfully; &ldquo;the officiating priest, the beadle, and only one chorister
      boy, nothing more. You observe, messieurs, that the defunct lady or
      gentleman could not have been of very high rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; no one seems to be following the coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;I see a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; a man wrapped in a cloak,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth looking at,&rdquo; said Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find it interesting,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, leaning on the window-sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, you are beginning to take a fancy to the place already,&rdquo; said
      Planchet, delightedly; &ldquo;it is exactly my own case. I was so melancholy at
      first that I could do nothing but make the sign of the cross all day, and
      the chants were like so many nails being driven into my head; but now,
      they lull me to sleep, and no bird I have ever seen or heard can sing
      better than those which are to be met with in this cemetery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;this is beginning to get a little dull for me, and
      I prefer going downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planchet with one bound was beside his guest, whom he offered to lead into
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Porthos to D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he turned round, &ldquo;are you going to
      remain here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will join you presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, M. D&rsquo;Artagnan is right, after all,&rdquo; said Planchet: &ldquo;are they
      beginning to bury yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, the grave-digger is waiting until the cords are fastened round
      the bier. But, see, a woman has just entered the cemetery at the other
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my dear Planchet,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, quickly, &ldquo;leave me, leave
      me; I feel I am beginning already to be much comforted by my meditations,
      so do not interrupt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planchet left, and D&rsquo;Artagnan remained, devouring with his eager gaze from
      behind the half-closed blinds what was taking place just before him. The
      two bearers of the corpse had unfastened the straps by which they carried
      the litter, and were letting their burden glide gently into the open
      grave. At a few paces distant, the man with the cloak wrapped round him,
      the only spectator of this melancholy scene, was leaning with his back
      against a large cypress-tree, and kept his face and person entirely
      concealed from the grave-diggers and the priests; the corpse was buried in
      five minutes. The grave having been filled up, the priests turned away,
      and the grave-digger having addressed a few words to them, followed them
      as they moved away. The man in the mantle bowed as they passed him, and
      put a piece of gold into the grave-digger&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordioux!</i>&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;it is Aramis himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, in fact, remained alone, on that side at least; for hardly had he
      turned his head when a woman&rsquo;s footsteps, and the rustling of her dress,
      were heard in the path close to him. He immediately turned round, and took
      off his hat with the most ceremonious respect; he led the lady under the
      shelter of some walnut and lime trees, which overshadowed a magnificent
      tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! who would have thought it,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;the bishop of Vannes at
      a rendezvous! He is still the same Abbe Aramis as he was at Noisy-le-Sec.
      Yes,&rdquo; he added, after a pause; &ldquo;but as it is in a cemetery, the rendezvous
      is sacred.&rdquo; But he almost laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation lasted for fully half an hour. D&rsquo;Artagnan could not see
      the lady&rsquo;s face, for she kept her back turned towards him; but he saw
      perfectly well, by the erect attitude of both the speakers, by their
      gestures, by the measured and careful manner with which they glanced at
      each other, either by way of attack or defense, that they must be
      conversing about any other subject than of love. At the end of the
      conversation the lady rose, and bowed profoundly to Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;this rendezvous finishes like one of a very
      tender nature though. The cavalier kneels at the beginning, the young lady
      by and by gets tamed down, and then it is she who has to supplicate. Who
      is this lady? I would give anything to ascertain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed impossible, however, for Aramis was the first to leave; the
      lady carefully concealed her head and face, and then immediately departed.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan could hold out no longer; he ran to the window which looked out
      on the Rue de Lyon, and saw Aramis entering the inn. The lady was
      proceeding in quite an opposite direction, and seemed, in fact, to be
      about to rejoin an equipage, consisting of two led horses and a carriage,
      which he could see standing close to the borders of the forest. She was
      walking slowly, her head bent down, absorbed in the deepest meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordioux! Mordioux!</i> I must and will learn who that woman is,&rdquo; said
      the musketeer again; and then, without further deliberation, he set off in
      pursuit of her. As he was going along, he tried to think how he could
      possibly contrive to make her raise her veil. &ldquo;She is not young,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and is a woman of high rank in society. I ought to know that figure and
      peculiar style of walk.&rdquo; As he ran, the sound of his spurs and of his
      boots upon the hard ground of the street made a strange jingling noise; a
      fortunate circumstance in itself, which he was far from reckoning upon.
      The noise disturbed the lady; she seemed to fancy she was being either
      followed or pursued, which was indeed the case, and turned round.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan started as if he had received a charge of small shot in his
      legs, and then turning suddenly round as if he were going back the same
      way he had come, he murmured, &ldquo;Madame de Chevreuse!&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan would not
      go home until he had learnt everything. He asked Celestin to inquire of
      the grave-digger whose body it was they had buried that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor Franciscan mendicant friar,&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;who had not even
      a dog to love him in this world, and to accompany him to his last
      resting-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that were really the case,&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;we should not have
      found Aramis present at his funeral. The bishop of Vannes is not precisely
      a dog as far as devotion goes: his scent, however, is quite as keen, I
      admit.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter VII. How Porthos, Truchen, and Planchet Parted with Each Other on
      Friendly Terms, Thanks to D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was good living in Planchet&rsquo;s house. Porthos broke a ladder and two
      cherry-trees, stripped the raspberry-bushes, and was only unable to
      succeed in reaching the strawberry-beds on account, as he said, of his
      belt. Truchen, who had become quite sociable with the giant, said that it
      was not the belt so much as his corporation; and Porthos, in a state of
      the highest delight, embraced Truchen, who gathered him a pailful of the
      strawberries, and made him eat them out of her hands. D&rsquo;Artagnan, who
      arrived in the midst of these little innocent flirtations, scolded Porthos
      for his indolence, and silently pitied Planchet. Porthos breakfasted with
      a very good appetite, and when he had finished, he said, looking at
      Truchen, &ldquo;I could make myself very happy here.&rdquo; Truchen smiled at his
      remark, and so did Planchet, but not without embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan then addressed Porthos: &ldquo;You must not let the delights of Capua
      make you forget the real object of our journey to Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My presentation to the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I am going to take a turn in the town to get everything ready
      for that. Do not think of leaving the house, I beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planchet looked at D&rsquo;Artagnan nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be away long?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend; and this very evening I will release you from two
      troublesome guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan! can you say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; you are a noble-hearted fellow, but your house is very small.
      Such a house, with half a dozen acres of land, would be fit for a king,
      and make him very happy, too. But you were not born a great lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more was M. Porthos,&rdquo; murmured Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has become so, my good fellow; his income has been a hundred
      thousand francs a year for the last twenty years, and for the last fifty
      years Porthos has been the owner of a couple of fists and a backbone,
      which are not to be matched throughout the whole realm of France. Porthos
      is a man of the very greatest consequence compared to you, and... well, I
      need say no more, for I know you are an intelligent fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, monsieur, explain what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at your orchard, how stripped it is, how empty your larder, your
      bedstead broken, your cellar almost exhausted, look too... at Madame
      Truchen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my goodness gracious!&rdquo; said Planchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Truchen is an excellent person,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;but keep
      her for yourself, do you understand?&rdquo; and he slapped him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planchet at this moment perceived Porthos and Truchen sitting close
      together in an arbor; Truchen, with a grace of manner peculiarly Flemish,
      was making a pair of earrings for Porthos out of a double cherry, while
      Porthos was laughing as amorously as Samson in the company of Delilah.
      Planchet pressed D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s hand, and ran towards the arbor. We must do
      Porthos the justice to say that he did not move as they approached, and,
      very likely, he did not think he was doing any harm. Nor indeed did
      Truchen move either, which rather put Planchet out; but he, too, had been
      so accustomed to see fashionable folk in his shop, that he found no
      difficulty in putting a good countenance on what seemed disagreeable or
      rude. Planchet seized Porthos by the arm, and proposed to go and look at
      the horses, but Porthos pretended he was tired. Planchet then suggested
      that the Baron du Vallon should taste some noyeau of his own manufacture,
      which was not to be equaled anywhere; an offer the baron immediately
      accepted; and, in this way, Planchet managed to engage his enemy&rsquo;s
      attention during the whole of the day, by dint of sacrificing his cellar,
      in preference to his <i>amour propre</i>. Two hours afterwards D&rsquo;Artagnan
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is arranged,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I saw his majesty at the very moment
      he was setting off for the chase; the king expects us this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king expects <i>me!</i>&rdquo; cried Porthos, drawing himself up. It is a
      sad thing to have to confess, but a man&rsquo;s heart is like an ocean billow;
      for, from that very moment Porthos ceased to look at Madame Truchen in
      that touching manner which had so softened her heart. Planchet encouraged
      these ambitious leanings as best as he could. He talked over, or rather
      gave exaggerated accounts of all the splendors of the last reign, its
      battles, sieges, and grand court ceremonies. He spoke of the luxurious
      display which the English made; the prizes the three brave companions
      carried off; and how D&rsquo;Artagnan, who at the beginning had been the
      humblest of the four, finished by becoming the leader. He fired Porthos
      with a generous feeling of enthusiasm by reminding him of his early youth
      now passed away; he boasted as much as he could of the moral life this
      great lord had led, and how religiously he respected the ties of
      friendship; he was eloquent, and skillful in his choice of subjects. He
      tickled Porthos, frightened Truchen, and made D&rsquo;Artagnan think. At six
      o&rsquo;clock, the musketeer ordered the horses to be brought round, and told
      Porthos to get ready. He thanked Planchet for his kind hospitality,
      whispered a few words about a post he might succeed in obtaining for him
      at court, which immediately raised Planchet in Truchen&rsquo;s estimation, where
      the poor grocer&mdash;so good, so generous, so devoted&mdash;had become
      much lowered ever since the appearance and comparison with him of the two
      great gentlemen. Such, however, is a woman&rsquo;s nature; they are anxious to
      possess what they have not got, and disdain it as soon as it is acquired.
      After having rendered this service to his friend Planchet, D&rsquo;Artagnan said
      in a low tone of voice to Porthos: &ldquo;That is a very beautiful ring you have
      on your finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worth three hundred pistoles,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Truchen will remember you better if you leave her that ring,&rdquo;
       replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, a suggestion which Porthos seemed to hesitate to
      adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it is not beautiful enough, perhaps,&rdquo; said the musketeer. &ldquo;I
      understand your feelings; a great lord such as you would not think of
      accepting the hospitality of an old servant without paying him most
      handsomely for it: but I am sure that Planchet is too good-hearted a
      fellow to remember that you have an income of a hundred thousand francs a
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have more than half a mind,&rdquo; said Porthos, flattered by the remark, &ldquo;to
      make Madame Truchen a present of my little farm at Bracieux; it has twelve
      acres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too much, my good Porthos, too much just at present... Keep it for
      a future occasion.&rdquo; He then took the ring off Porthos&rsquo;s finger, and
      approaching Truchen, said to her:&mdash;&ldquo;Madame, monsieur le baron hardly
      knows how to entreat you, out of your regard for him, to accept this
      little ring. M. du Vallon is one of the most generous and discreet men of
      my acquaintance. He wished to offer you a farm that he has at Bracieux,
      but I dissuaded him from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Truchen, looking eagerly at the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le baron!&rdquo; exclaimed Planchet, quite overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; stammered out Porthos, delighted at having been so well
      represented by D&rsquo;Artagnan. These several exclamations, uttered at the same
      moment, made quite a pathetic winding-up of a day which might have
      finished in a very ridiculous manner. But D&rsquo;Artagnan was there, and, on
      every occasion, wheresoever D&rsquo;Artagnan exercised any control, matters
      ended only just in the very way he wished and willed. There were general
      embracings; Truchen, whom the baron&rsquo;s munificence had restored to her
      proper position, very timidly, and blushing all the while, presented her
      forehead to the great lord with whom she had been on such very pretty
      terms the evening before. Planchet himself was overcome by a feeling of
      genuine humility. Still, in the same generosity of disposition, Porthos
      would have emptied his pockets into the hands of the cook and of Celestin;
      but D&rsquo;Artagnan stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is now my turn.&rdquo; And he gave one pistole to the woman
      and two to the man; and the benedictions which were showered down upon
      them would have rejoiced the heart of Harpagon himself, and have rendered
      even him a prodigal.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan made Planchet lead them to the chateau, and introduced Porthos
      into his own apartment, where he arrived safely without having been
      perceived by those he was afraid of meeting.

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII. The Presentation of Porthos at Court.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock the same evening, the king gave an audience to an
      ambassador from the United Provinces, in the grand reception-room. The
      audience lasted a quarter of an hour. His majesty afterwards received
      those who had been recently presented, together with a few ladies, who
      paid their respects first. In one corner of the salon, concealed behind a
      column, Porthos and D&rsquo;Artagnan were conversing together, waiting until
      their turn arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo; inquired the musketeer of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look, then.&rdquo; Porthos raised himself on tiptoe, and saw M. Fouquet
      in full court dress, leading Aramis towards the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis!&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presented to the king by M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For having fortified Belle-Isle,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;oh, you! as I have already had the honor of telling you, are
      the good-natured, kind-hearted Porthos; and so they begged you to take
      care of Saint-Mande a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; repeated Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, happily, I was there,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;and presently it will be <i>my</i>
      turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Fouquet addressed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have a favor to solicit of your majesty. M. d&rsquo;Herblay
      is not ambitious, but he knows when he can be of service. Your majesty
      needs a representative at Rome, who would be able to exercise a powerful
      influence there; may I request a cardinal&rsquo;s hat for M. d&rsquo;Herblay?&rdquo; The
      king started. &ldquo;I do not often solicit anything of your majesty,&rdquo; said
      Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a reason, certainly,&rdquo; replied the king, who always expressed any
      hesitation he might have in that manner, and to which remark there was
      nothing to say in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet and Aramis looked at each other. The king resumed: &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Herblay
      can serve us equally well in France; an archbishopric, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; objected Fouquet, with a grace of manner peculiarly his own, &ldquo;your
      majesty overwhelms M. d&rsquo;Herblay; the archbishopric may, in your majesty&rsquo;s
      extreme kindness, be conferred in addition to the hat; the one does not
      exclude the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king admired the readiness which he displayed, and smiled, saying:
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan himself could not have answered better.&rdquo; He had no sooner
      pronounced the name than D&rsquo;Artagnan appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your majesty call me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis and Fouquet drew back a step, as if they were about to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your majesty allow me,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan quickly, as he led forward
      Porthos, &ldquo;to present to your majesty M. le Baron du Vallon, one of the
      bravest gentlemen of France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Aramis saw Porthos, he turned as pale as death, while Fouquet
      clenched his hands under his ruffles. D&rsquo;Artagnan smiled blandly at both of
      them, while Porthos bowed, visibly overcome before the royal presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porthos here?&rdquo; murmured Fouquet in Aramis&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! deep treachery at work,&rdquo; hissed the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;it is more than six years ago I ought to have
      presented M. du Vallon to your majesty; but certain men resemble stars,
      they move not one inch unless their satellites accompany them. The
      Pleiades are never disunited, and that is the reason I have selected, for
      the purpose of presenting him to you, the very moment when you would see
      M. d&rsquo;Herblay by his side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis almost lost countenance. He looked at D&rsquo;Artagnan with a proud,
      haughty air, as though willing to accept the defiance the latter seemed to
      throw down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! these gentlemen are good friends, then?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent friends, sire; the one can answer for the other. Ask M. de
      Vannes now in what manner Belle-Isle was fortified?&rdquo; Fouquet moved back a
      step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belle-Isle,&rdquo; said Aramis, coldly, &ldquo;was fortified by that gentleman,&rdquo; and
      he indicated Porthos with his hand, who bowed a second time. Louis could
      not withhold his admiration, though at the same time his suspicions were
      aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;but ask monsieur le baron whose assistance he had
      in carrying the works out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Porthos, frankly; and he pointed to the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce does all this mean?&rdquo; thought the bishop, &ldquo;and what sort of
      a termination are we to expect to this comedy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, &ldquo;is the cardinal&rsquo;s, I mean this bishop&rsquo;s, name
      <i>Aramis?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His <i>nom de guerre</i>,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nickname,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to modesty!&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;beneath the priest&rsquo;s robe,
      sire, is concealed the most brilliant officer, a gentleman of the most
      unparalleled intrepidity, and the wisest theologian in your kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis raised his head. &ldquo;And an engineer, also, it appears,&rdquo; he said,
      admiring Aramis&rsquo;s calm, imperturbable self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An engineer for a particular purpose, sire,&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My companion in the musketeers, sire,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, with great warmth
      of manner, &ldquo;the man who has more than a hundred times aided your father&rsquo;s
      ministers by his advice&mdash;M. d&rsquo;Herblay, in a word, who, with M. du
      Vallon, myself, and M. le Comte de la Fere, who is known to your majesty,
      formed that quartette which was a good deal talked about during the late
      king&rsquo;s reign, and during your majesty&rsquo;s minority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who fortified Belle-Isle?&rdquo; the king repeated, in a significant tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis advanced and bowed: &ldquo;In order to serve the son as I served the
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan looked very narrowly at Aramis while he uttered these words,
      which displayed so much true respect, so much warm devotion, such entire
      frankness and sincerity, that even he, D&rsquo;Artagnan, the eternal doubter,
      he, the almost infallible in judgment, was deceived by it. &ldquo;A man who lies
      cannot speak in such a tone as that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis was overcome by it. &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; he said to Fouquet, who
      anxiously awaited the result of this proof, &ldquo;the cardinal&rsquo;s hat is
      promised. Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay, I pledge you my honor that the first
      promotion shall be yours. Thank M. Fouquet for it.&rdquo; Colbert overheard
      these words; they stung him to the quick, and he left the salon abruptly.
      &ldquo;And you, Monsieur du Vallon,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;what have you to ask? I am
      truly pleased to have it in my power to acknowledge the services of those
      who were faithful to my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire&mdash;&rdquo; began Porthos, but he was unable to proceed with what he was
      going to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;this worthy gentleman is utterly
      overpowered by your majesty&rsquo;s presence, he who so valiantly sustained the
      looks and the fire of a thousand foes. But, knowing what his thoughts are,
      I&mdash;who am more accustomed to gaze upon the sun&mdash;can translate
      them: he needs nothing, absolutely nothing; his sole desire is to have the
      happiness of gazing upon your majesty for a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall sup with me this evening,&rdquo; said the king, saluting Porthos with
      a gracious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos became crimson from delight and pride. The king dismissed him, and
      D&rsquo;Artagnan pushed him into the adjoining apartment, after he had embraced
      him warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit next to me at table,&rdquo; said Porthos in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis is annoyed with me, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis has never liked you so much as he does now. Fancy, it was I who
      was the means of his getting the cardinal&rsquo;s hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;By the by, does the king like his guests to
      eat much at his table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a compliment to himself if you do,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;for he
      himself possesses a royal appetite.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter IX. Explanations.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aramis cleverly managed to effect a diversion for the purpose of finding
      D&rsquo;Artagnan and Porthos. He came up to the latter, behind one of the
      columns, and, as he pressed his hand, said, &ldquo;So you have escaped from my
      prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not scold him,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;it was I, dear Aramis, who set him
      free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my friend,&rdquo; replied Aramis, looking at Porthos, &ldquo;could you not have
      waited with a little more patience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan came to the assistance of Porthos, who already began to breathe
      hard, in sore perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you members of the Church are great politicians; we mere
      soldiers come at once to the point. The facts are these: I went to pay
      Baisemeaux a visit&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis pricked up his ears at this announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;you make me remember that I have a letter from
      Baisemeaux for you, Aramis.&rdquo; And Porthos held out the bishop the letter we
      have already seen. Aramis begged to be allowed to read it, and read it
      without D&rsquo;Artagnan feeling in the slightest degree embarrassed by the
      circumstance that he was so well acquainted with the contents of it.
      Besides, Aramis&rsquo;s face was so impenetrable, that D&rsquo;Artagnan could not but
      admire him more than ever; after he had read it, he put the letter into
      his pocket with the calmest possible air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were saying, captain?&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying,&rdquo; continued the musketeer, &ldquo;that I had gone to pay
      Baisemeaux a visit on his majesty&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his majesty&rsquo;s service?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;and, naturally enough, we talked about you and
      our friends. I must say that Baisemeaux received me coldly; so I soon took
      my leave of him. As I was returning, a soldier accosted me, and said (no
      doubt as he recognized me, notwithstanding I was in private clothes),
      &lsquo;Captain, will you be good enough to read me the name written on this
      envelope?&rsquo; and I read, &lsquo;To Monsieur du Vallon, at M. Fouquet&rsquo;s house,
      Saint-Mande.&rsquo; The deuce, I said to myself, Porthos has not returned, then,
      as I fancied, to Bell-Isle, or to Pierrefonds, but is at M. Fouquet&rsquo;s
      house, at Saint-Mande; and as M. Fouquet is not at Saint-Mande, Porthos
      must be quite alone, or, at all events, with Aramis; I will go and see
      Porthos, and I accordingly went to see Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Aramis, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never told me that,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no time, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you brought back Porthos with you to Fontainebleau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to Planchet&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Planchet live at Fontainebleau?&rdquo; inquired Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, near the cemetery,&rdquo; said Porthos, thoughtlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;near the cemetery?&rsquo;&rdquo; said Aramis, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; thought the musketeer, &ldquo;since there is to be a squabble, let us
      take advantage of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the cemetery,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;Planchet is a very excellent fellow,
      who makes very excellent preserves; but his house has windows which look
      out upon the cemetery. And a confoundedly melancholy prospect it is! So
      this morning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning?&rdquo; said Aramis, more and more excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan turned his back to them, and walked to the window, where he
      began to play a march upon one of the panes of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this morning we saw a man buried there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very depressing, was it not? I should never be able to live in a house
      where burials can always be seen from the window. D&rsquo;Artagnan, on the
      contrary, seems to like it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So D&rsquo;Artagnan saw it as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not simply <i>saw</i> it; he literally never took his eyes off the whole
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis started, and turned to look at the musketeer, but the latter was
      engaged in earnest conversation with Saint-Aignan. Aramis continued to
      question Porthos, and when he had squeezed all the juice out of this
      enormous lemon, he threw the peel aside. He turned towards his friend
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, and clapping him on the shoulder, when Saint-Aignan had left
      him, the king&rsquo;s supper having been announced, said, &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not sup with his majesty, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&mdash;<i>we</i> do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give me ten minutes&rsquo; conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty, if you like. His majesty will take quite that time to get
      properly seated at table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we talk, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, upon these seats if you like; the king has left, we can sit down,
      and the apartment is empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit down, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down, and Aramis took one of D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, candidly, my dear friend, whether you have not counseled Porthos
      to distrust me a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit, I have, but not as you understand it. I saw that Porthos was
      bored to death, and I wished, by presenting him to the king, to do for
      him, and for you, what you would never do for yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak in your own praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have done it most nobly; I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I brought the cardinal&rsquo;s hat a little nearer, just as it seemed to be
      retreating from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I admit that,&rdquo; said Aramis, with a singular smile, &ldquo;you are, indeed,
      not to be matched for making your friends&rsquo; fortunes for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, then, that I only acted with the view of making Porthos&rsquo;s
      fortune for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to have done that myself; but your arm reaches farther than
      ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s turn to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;we ought to deal truthfully with each other. Do you
      still love me, D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as I used to do,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, without compromising
      himself too much by this reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, thanks; and now, for the most perfect frankness,&rdquo; said
      Aramis; &ldquo;you visited Belle-Isle on behalf of the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wished to deprive us of the pleasure of offering Bell-Isle completely
      fortified to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before I could deprive you of that pleasure, I ought to have been
      made acquainted with your intention of doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to Belle-Isle without knowing anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of you! yes. How the devil could I imagine that Aramis had become so
      clever an engineer as to be able to fortify like Polybius, or Archimedes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. And yet you smelt me out over yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Porthos, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not divine that Aramis was an engineer. I was only able to guess
      that Porthos might have become one. There is a saying, one becomes an
      orator, one is born a poet; but it has never been said, one is born
      Porthos, and one becomes an engineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wit is always amusing,&rdquo; said Aramis, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do. When you found out our secret, you made all the haste you could to
      communicate it to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly made as much haste as I could, since I saw that you were
      making still more. When a man weighing two hundred and fifty pounds, as
      Porthos does, rides post; when a gouty prelate&mdash;I beg your pardon,
      but you yourself told me you were so&mdash;when a prelate scours the
      highway&mdash;I naturally suppose that my two friends, who did not wish to
      be communicative with me, had certain matters of the highest importance to
      conceal from me, and so I made as much haste as my leanness and the
      absence of gout would allow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it not occur to you, my dear friend, that you might be rendering
      Porthos and myself a very sad service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought it not unlikely; but you and Porthos made me play a very
      ridiculous part at Belle-Isle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that,&rdquo; pursued Aramis, &ldquo;you now know everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I was obliged to inform M. Fouquet of what had happened, in
      order that he would be able to anticipate what you might have to tell the
      king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather obscure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all: M. Fouquet has his enemies&mdash;you will admit that, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one in particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dangerous one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mortal enemy. Well, in order to counteract that man&rsquo;s influence, it was
      necessary that M. Fouquet should give the king a proof of his great
      devotion to him, and of his readiness to make the greatest sacrifices. He
      surprised his majesty by offering him Belle-Isle. If you had been the
      first to reach Paris, the surprise would have been destroyed, it would
      have looked as if we had yielded to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the whole mystery,&rdquo; said Aramis, satisfied that he had at last
      quite convinced the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;it would have been more simple to have taken me
      aside, and said to me, &lsquo;My dear D&rsquo;Artagnan, we are fortifying Belle-Isle,
      and intend to offer it to the king. Tell us frankly, for whom you are
      acting. Are you a friend of M. Colbert, or of M. Fouquet?&rsquo; Perhaps I
      should not have answered you, but you would have added,&mdash;&lsquo;Are you my
      friend?&rsquo; I should have said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo; Aramis hung down his head. &ldquo;In this
      way,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you would have paralyzed my movements, and I
      should have gone to the king, and said, &lsquo;Sire, M. Fouquet is fortifying
      Belle-Isle, and exceedingly well, too; but here is a note, which the
      governor of Belle-Isle gave me for your majesty;&rsquo; or, &lsquo;M. Fouquet is about
      to wait upon your majesty to explain his intentions with regard to it.&rsquo; I
      should not have been placed in an absurd position; you would have enjoyed
      the surprise so long planned, and we should not have had any occasion to
      look askant at each other when we met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While, on the contrary,&rdquo; replied Aramis, &ldquo;you have acted altogether as
      one friendly to M. Colbert. And you really are a friend of his, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain. &ldquo;M. Colbert is a mean
      fellow, and I hate him as I used to hate Mazarin, but without fearing
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;I love M. Fouquet, and his interests are mine.
      You know my position. I have no property or means whatever. M. Fouquet
      gave me several livings, a bishopric as well; M. Fouquet has served and
      obliged me like the generous-hearted man he is, and I know the world
      sufficiently well to appreciate a kindness when I meet with one. M.
      Fouquet has won my regard, and I have devoted myself to his service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not possibly do better. You will find him a very liberal
      master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis bit his lips; and then said, &ldquo;The best a man could possibly have.&rdquo;
       He then paused for a minute, D&rsquo;Artagnan taking good care not to interrupt
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know how Porthos got mixed up in all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;I am curious, of course, but I never question a
      friend when he wishes to keep a secret from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hardly worth the trouble, if the confidence is to bind me in any
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not be afraid.; there is no man whom I love better than Porthos,
      because he is so simple-minded and good-natured. Porthos is so
      straightforward in everything. Since I have become a bishop, I have looked
      for these primeval natures, which make me love truth and hate intrigue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan stroked his mustache, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Porthos and again cultivated his acquaintance; his own time hanging
      idly on his hands, his presence recalled my earlier and better days
      without engaging me in any present evil. I sent for Porthos to come to
      Vannes. M. Fouquet, whose regard for me is very great, having learnt that
      Porthos and I were attached to each other by old ties of friendship,
      promised him increase of rank at the earliest promotion, and that is the
      whole secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not abuse your confidence,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of that, my dear friend; no one has a finer sense of honor than
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I flatter myself that you are right, Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&rdquo;&mdash;and here the prelate looked searchingly and scrutinizingly
      at his friend&mdash;&ldquo;now let us talk of ourselves and for ourselves; will
      you become one of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s friends? Do not interrupt me until you know
      what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you become a marechal of France, peer, duke, and the possessor of a
      duchy, with a million of francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my friend,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;what must one do to get all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belong to M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I already belong to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exclusively, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a D&rsquo;Artagnan cannot be divided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, I presume, ambitions, as noble hearts like yours have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I wish to be a marechal; the king will make me marechal, duke,
      peer; the king will make me all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis fixed a searching look upon D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not the king master?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one disputes it; but Louis XIII. was master also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear friend, between Richelieu and Louis XIII. stood no
      D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said the musketeer, very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many stumbling-blocks round the king,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the king&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely not; still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Aramis; I observe that every one thinks of himself, and never
      of his poor prince; I will maintain myself maintaining him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you meet with ingratitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weak alone are afraid of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite certain of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, the king may some day have no further need for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I think his need of me will soon be greater than ever;
      and hearken, my dear fellow, if it became necessary to arrest a new Conde,
      who would do it? This&mdash;this alone in France!&rdquo; and D&rsquo;Artagnan struck
      his sword, which clanked sullenly on the tesselated floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Aramis, turning very pale; and then he rose and
      pressed D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the last summons for supper,&rdquo; said the captain of the musketeers;
      &ldquo;will you excuse me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis threw his arm round the musketeer&rsquo;s neck, and said, &ldquo;A friend like
      you is the brightest jewel in the royal crown.&rdquo; And they immediately
      separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was right,&rdquo; mused D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;there is, indeed, something strangely
      serious stirring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must hasten the explosion,&rdquo; breathed the coming cardinal, &ldquo;for
      D&rsquo;Artagnan has discovered the existence of a plot.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter X. Madame and De Guiche.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It will not be forgotten how Comte de Guiche left the queen-mother&rsquo;s
      apartments on the day when Louis XIV. presented La Valliere with the
      beautiful bracelets he had won in the lottery. The comte walked to and fro
      for some time outside the palace, in the greatest distress, from a
      thousand suspicions and anxieties with which his mind was beset. Presently
      he stopped and waited on the terrace opposite the grove of trees, watching
      for Madame&rsquo;s departure. More than half an hour passed away; and as he was
      at that moment quite alone, the comte could hardly have had any very
      diverting ideas at his command. He drew his tables from his pocket, and,
      after hesitating over and over again, determined to write these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Madame,
      I implore you to grant me one moment&rsquo;s conversation. Do not be alarmed at
      this request, which contains nothing in any way opposed to the profound
      respect with which I subscribe myself, etc., etc.&rdquo; He had signed and
      folded this singular love-letter, when he suddenly observed several ladies
      leaving the chateau, and afterwards several courtiers too; in fact, almost
      every one that formed the queen&rsquo;s circle. He saw La Valliere herself, then
      Montalais talking with Malicorne; he watched the departure of the very
      last of the numerous guests that had a short time before thronged the
      queen-mother&rsquo;s cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame herself had not yet passed; she would be obliged, however, to cross
      the courtyard in order to enter her own apartments; and, from the terrace
      where he was standing, De Guiche could see all that was going on in the
      courtyard. At last he saw Madame leave, attended by a couple of pages, who
      were carrying torches before her. She was walking very quickly; as soon as
      she reached the door, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let some one go and look for De Guiche: he has to render an account of a
      mission he had to discharge for me; if he should be disengaged, request
      him to be good enough to come to my apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche remained silent, hidden in the shade; but as soon as Madame had
      withdrawn, he darted from the terrace down the steps and assumed a most
      indifferent air, so that the pages who were hurrying towards his rooms
      might meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is Madame, then, who is seeking me!&rdquo; he said to himself, quite
      overcome; and he crushed in his hand the now worse than useless letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le comte,&rdquo; said one of the pages, approaching him, &ldquo;we are indeed most
      fortunate in meeting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, messieurs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A command from Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Madame!&rdquo; said De Guiche, looking surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M. le comte, her royal highness has been asking for you; she expects
      to hear, she told us, the result of a commission you had to execute for
      her. Are you at liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite at her royal highness&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have the goodness to follow us, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When De Guiche entered the princess&rsquo;s apartments, he found her pale and
      agitated. Montalais was standing at the door, evidently uneasy about what
      was passing in her mistress&rsquo;s mind. De Guiche appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is that you, Monsieur de Guiche?&rdquo; said Madame; &ldquo;come in, I beg.
      Mademoiselle de Montalais, I do not require your attendance any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais, more puzzled than ever, courtesied and withdrew. De Guiche and
      the princess were left alone. The comte had every advantage in his favor;
      it was Madame who had summoned him to a rendezvous. But how was it
      possible for the comte to make use of this advantage? Madame was so
      whimsical, and her disposition so changeable. She soon allowed this to be
      perceived, for, suddenly, opening the conversation, she said: &ldquo;Well! have
      you nothing to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He imagined she must have guessed his thoughts; he fancied (for those who
      are in love are thus constituted, being as credulous and blind as poets or
      prophets), he fancied she knew how ardent was his desire to see her, and
      also the subject uppermost in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I think it very singular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The affair of the bracelets,&rdquo; she exclaimed, eagerly, &ldquo;you mean that, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think the king is in love; do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guiche looked at her for some time; her eyes sank under his gaze, which
      seemed to read her very heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the king may possibly have had an idea of
      annoying some one; were it not for that, the king would hardly show
      himself so earnest in his attentions as he is; he would not run the risk
      of compromising, from mere thoughtlessness of disposition, a young girl
      against whom no one has been hitherto able to say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! the bold, shameless girl,&rdquo; said the princess, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can positively assure your royal highness,&rdquo; said De Guiche, with a
      firmness marked by great respect, &ldquo;that Mademoiselle de la Valliere is
      beloved by a man who merits every respect, for he is a brave and honorable
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bragelonne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend; yes, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and though he is your friend, what does that matter to the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king knows that Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere; and as Raoul has served the king most valiantly, the king will
      not inflict an irreparable injury upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame began to laugh in a manner that produced a sinister impression upon
      De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, Madame, I do not believe the king is in love with Mademoiselle
      de la Valliere; and the proof that I do not believe it is, that I was
      about to ask you whose <i>amour propre</i> it is likely the king is
      desirous of wounding? You, who are well acquainted with the whole court,
      can perhaps assist me in ascertaining that; and assuredly, with greater
      certainty, since it is everywhere said that your royal highness is on very
      friendly terms with the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame bit her lips, and, unable to assign any good and sufficient
      reasons, changed the conversation. &ldquo;Prove to me,&rdquo; she said, fixing on him
      one of those looks in which the whole soul seems to pass into the eyes,
      &ldquo;prove to me, I say, that you intended to interrogate me at the very
      moment I sent for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche gravely drew from his pocket the now crumpled note that he had
      written, and showed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sympathy,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the comte, with an indescribable tenderness of tone,
      &ldquo;sympathy. I have explained to you how and why I sought you; you, however,
      have yet to tell me, Madame, why you sent for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the princess. She hesitated, and then suddenly exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Those bracelets will drive me mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expected the king would offer them to you,&rdquo; replied De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before you, Madame, before you, his sister-in-law, was there not the
      queen herself to whom the king should have offered them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before La Valliere,&rdquo; cried the princess, wounded to the quick, &ldquo;could he
      not have presented them to me? Was there not the whole court, indeed, to
      choose from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, Madame,&rdquo; said the comte, respectfully, &ldquo;that if any one
      heard you speak in this manner, if any one were to see how red your eyes
      are, and, Heaven forgive me, to see, too, that tear trembling on your
      eyelids, it would be said that your royal highness was jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealous!&rdquo; said the princess, haughtily, &ldquo;jealous of La Valliere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She expected to see De Guiche yield beneath her scornful gesture and her
      proud tone; but he simply and boldly replied, &ldquo;Jealous of La Valliere;
      yes, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to suppose, monsieur,&rdquo; she stammered out, &ldquo;that your object is to
      insult me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not possible, Madame,&rdquo; replied the comte, slightly agitated, but
      resolved to master that fiery nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; said the princess, thoroughly exasperated, De Guiche&rsquo;s
      coolness and silent respect having made her completely lose her temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche fell back a step, bowed slowly, but with great respect, drew
      himself up, looking as white as his lace cuffs, and, in a voice slightly
      trembling, said, &ldquo;It was hardly worth while to have hurried here to be
      subjected to this unmerited disgrace.&rdquo; And he turned away with hasty
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely gone half a dozen paces when Madame darted like a tigress
      after him, seized him by the cuff, and making him turn round again, said,
      trembling with passion as she did so, &ldquo;The respect you pretend to have is
      more insulting than the insult itself. Insult me, if you please, but at
      least speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the comte, gently, as he drew his sword, &ldquo;thrust this blade
      into my heart, rather than kill me by degrees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the look he fixed upon her,&mdash;a look full of love, resolution, and
      despair, even,&mdash;she knew how readily the comte, so outwardly calm in
      appearance, would pass his sword through his own breast if she added
      another word. She tore the blade from his hands, and, pressing his arm
      with a feverish impatience, which might pass for tenderness, said, &ldquo;Do not
      be too hard upon me, comte. You see how I am suffering, and yet you have
      no pity for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears, the cries of this strange attack, stifled her voice. As soon as De
      Guiche saw her weep, he took her in his arms and carried her to an
      armchair; in another moment she would have been suffocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why,&rdquo; he murmured, as he knelt by her side, &ldquo;why do you conceal your
      troubles from me? Do you love any one&mdash;tell me? It would kill me, I
      know, but not until I should have comforted, consoled, and served you
      even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you love me to that extent?&rdquo; she replied, completely conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed love you to that extent, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She placed both her hands in his. &ldquo;My heart is indeed another&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she
      murmured in so low a tone that her voice could hardly be heard; but he
      heard it, and said, &ldquo;Is it the king you love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gently shook her head, and her smile was like a clear bright streak in
      the clouds, through which after the tempest has passed one almost fancies
      Paradise is opening. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;there are other passions in a
      high-born heart. Love is poetry; but the real life of the heart is pride.
      Comte, I was born on a throne, I am proud and jealous of my rank. Why does
      the king gather such unworthy objects round him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, I repeat,&rdquo; said the comte, &ldquo;you are acting unjustly towards
      that poor girl, who will one day be my friend&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you simple enough to believe that, comte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not believe it,&rdquo; he said, turning very pale, &ldquo;Bragelonne should
      be informed of it to-morrow; indeed he should, if I thought that poor La
      Valliere had forgotten the vows she had exchanged with Raoul. But no, it
      would be cowardly to betray a woman&rsquo;s secret; it would be criminal to
      disturb a friend&rsquo;s peace of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then,&rdquo; said the princess, with a wild burst of laughter, &ldquo;that
      ignorance is happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it to me, then,&rdquo; she said, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easily done, Madame. It is reported through the whole court that
      the king loves you, and that you return his affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, breathing with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; admit for a moment that Raoul, my friend, had come and said to me,
      &lsquo;Yes, the king loves Madame, and has made an impression upon her heart,&rsquo; I
      possibly should have slain Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been necessary,&rdquo; said the princess, with the obstinacy of a
      woman who feels herself not easily overcome, &ldquo;for M. de Bragelonne to have
      had proofs before he ventured to speak to you in that manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such, however, is the case,&rdquo; replied De Guiche, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;that,
      not having been warned, I have never examined into the matter seriously;
      and I now find that my ignorance has saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then, you drive selfishness and coldness to that extent,&rdquo; said
      Madame, &ldquo;that you would let this unhappy young man continue to love La
      Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, until La Valliere&rsquo;s guilt were revealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the bracelets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Madame, since you yourself expected to receive them from the king,
      what can I possibly say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The argument was a telling one, and the princess was overwhelmed by it,
      and from that moment her defeat was assured. But as her heart and mind
      were instinct with noble and generous feelings, she understood De Guiche&rsquo;s
      extreme delicacy. She saw that in his heart he really suspected that the
      king was in love with La Valliere, and that he did not wish to resort to
      the common expedient of ruining a rival in the mind of a woman, by giving
      the latter the assurance and certainty that this rival&rsquo;s affections were
      transferred to another woman. She guessed that his suspicions of La
      Valliere were aroused, and that, in order to leave himself time for his
      convictions to undergo a change, so as not to ruin Louise utterly, he was
      determined to pursue a certain straightforward line of conduct. She could
      read so much real greatness of character, and such true generosity of
      disposition in her lover, that her heart really warmed with affection
      towards him, whose passion for her was so pure and delicate. Despite his
      fear of incurring her displeasure, De Guiche, by retaining his position as
      a man of proud independence of feeling and deep devotion, became almost a
      hero in her estimation, and reduced her to the state of a jealous and
      little-minded woman. She loved him for this so tenderly, that she could
      not refuse to give him a proof of her affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how many words we have wasted,&rdquo; she said, taking his hand,
      &ldquo;suspicions, anxieties, mistrust, sufferings&mdash;I think we have
      enumerated all those words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Madame, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Efface them from your heart as I drive them from mine. Whether La
      Valliere does or does not love the king, and whether the king does or does
      not love La Valliere&mdash;from this moment you and I will draw a
      distinction in the two characters I have to perform. You open your eyes so
      wide that I am sure you hardly understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so impetuous, Madame, that I always tremble at the fear of
      displeasing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And see how he trembles now, poor fellow,&rdquo; she said, with the most
      charming playfulness of manner. &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, I have two characters to
      perform. I am the sister of the king, the sister-in-law of the king&rsquo;s
      wife. In this character ought I not to take an interest in these domestic
      intrigues? Come, tell me what you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As little as possible, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed, monsieur; but it is a question of dignity; and then, you know, I
      am the wife of the king&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo; De Guiche sighed. &ldquo;A circumstance,&rdquo;
       she added, with an expression of great tenderness, &ldquo;which will remind you
      that I am always to be treated with the profoundest respect.&rdquo; De Guiche
      fell at her feet, which he kissed, with the religious fervor of a
      worshipper. &ldquo;And I begin to think that, really and truly, I have another
      character to perform. I was almost forgetting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it, oh! name it,&rdquo; said De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a woman,&rdquo; she said, in a voice lower than ever, &ldquo;and I love.&rdquo; He
      rose, she opened her arms, and their lips met. A footstep was heard behind
      the tapestry, and Mademoiselle de Montalais appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche is wanted,&rdquo; replied Montalais, who was just in time to see
      the agitation of the actors of these four characters; for De Guiche had
      consistently carried out his part with heroism.

    <h2>
      Chapter XI. Montalais and Malicorne.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Montalais was right. M. de Guiche, thus summoned in every direction, was
      very much exposed, from such a multiplication of business, to the risk of
      not attending to any. It so happened that, considering the awkwardness of
      the interruption, Madame, notwithstanding her wounded pride, and secret
      anger, could not, for the moment at least, reproach Montalais for having
      violated, in so bold a manner, the semi-royal order with which she had
      been dismissed on De Guiche&rsquo;s entrance. De Guiche, also, lost his presence
      of mind, or, it would be more correct to say, had already lost it, before
      Montalais&rsquo;s arrival, for, scarcely had he heard the young girl&rsquo;s voice,
      than, without taking leave of Madame, as the most ordinary politeness
      required, even between persons equal in rank and station, he fled from her
      presence, his heart tumultuously throbbing, and his brain on fire, leaving
      the princess with one hand raised, as though to bid him adieu. Montalais
      was at no loss, therefore, to perceive the agitation of the two lovers&mdash;the
      one who fled was agitated, and the one who remained was equally so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured the young girl, as she glanced inquisitively round her,
      &ldquo;this time, at least, I think I know as much as the most curious woman
      could possibly wish to know.&rdquo; Madame felt so embarrassed by this
      inquisitorial look, that, as if she heard Montalais&rsquo;s muttered side
      remark, she did not speak a word to her maid of honor, but, casting down
      her eyes, retired at once to her bedroom. Montalais, observing this, stood
      listening for a moment, and then heard Madame lock and bolt her door. By
      this she knew that the rest of the evening was at her own disposal; and
      making, behind the door which had just been closed, a gesture which
      indicated but little real respect for the princess, she went down the
      staircase in search of Malicorne, who was very busily engaged at that
      moment in watching a courier, who, covered with dust, had just left the
      Comte de Guiche&rsquo;s apartments. Montalais knew that Malicorne was engaged in
      a matter of some importance; she therefore allowed him to look and stretch
      out his neck as much as he pleased; and it was only when Malicorne had
      resumed his natural position, that she touched him on the shoulder.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Montalais, &ldquo;what is the latest intelligence you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche is in love with Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine news, truly! I know something more recent than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Madame is in love with M. de Guiche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one is the consequence of the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always, my good monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that remark intended for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Present company always excepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Malicorne. &ldquo;Well, and in the other direction, what is
      stirring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king wished, this evening, after the lottery, to see Mademoiselle de
      la Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and he has seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door was shut and locked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that the king was obliged to go back again, looking very sheepish,
      like a thief who has forgotten his crowbar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the third place?&rdquo; inquired Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The courier who has just arrived for De Guiche came from M. de
      Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said Montalais, clapping her hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we have work to do. If we get weary now, something unlucky will
      be sure to happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must divide the work, then,&rdquo; said Malicorne, &ldquo;in order to avoid
      confusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; replied Montalais. &ldquo;Three intrigues, carefully nursed,
      and carefully encouraged, will produce, one with another, and taking a low
      average, three love letters a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Malicorne, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;you cannot mean what
      you say, darling; three letters a day, that may do for sentimental common
      people. A musketeer on duty, a young girl in a convent, may exchange
      letters with their lovers once a day, perhaps, from the top of a ladder,
      or through a hole in the wall. A letter contains all the poetry their poor
      little hearts have to boast of. But the cases we have in hand require to
      be dealt with very differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, finish,&rdquo; said Montalais, out of patience with him. &ldquo;Some one may
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish! Why, I am only at the beginning. I have still three points as yet
      untouched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, he will be the death of me, with his Flemish indifference,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will drive me mad with your Italian vivacity. I was going to say
      that our lovers here will be writing volumes to each other. But what are
      you driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this. Not one of our lady correspondents will be able to keep the
      letters they may receive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche will not be able to keep his either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is probable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; I will take care of all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very thing that is impossible,&rdquo; said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are not your own mistress; your room is as much La Valliere&rsquo;s
      as yours; and there are certain persons who will think nothing of visiting
      and searching a maid of honor&rsquo;s room; so that I am terribly afraid of the
      queen, who is as jealous as a Spaniard; of the queen-mother, who is as
      jealous as a couple of Spaniards; and, last of all, of Madame herself, who
      has jealousy enough for ten Spaniards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forgot some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only speaking of the women. Let us add them up, then: we will call
      Monsieur, No. 1.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Guiche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 2.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Vicomte de Bragelonne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 3.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king, the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 4. Of course the king, who not only will be more jealous, but more
      powerful than all the rest put together. Ah, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into what a wasp&rsquo;s nest you have thrust yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as yet not quite far enough, if you will follow me into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly I will follow you where you like. Yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we have time, I think it will be prudent to turn back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I, on the contrary, think the wisest course to take is to put
      ourselves at once at the head of all these intrigues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never be able to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you, I could superintend ten of them. I am in my element, you must
      know. I was born to live at the court, as the salamander is made to live
      in the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your comparison does not reassure me in the slightest degree in the
      world, my dear Montalais. I have heard it said, and by learned men too,
      that, in the first place, there are no salamanders at all, and that, if
      there had been any, they would have been infallibly baked or roasted on
      leaving the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your learned men may be very wise as far as salamanders are concerned,
      but they would never tell you what I can tell you; namely, that Aure de
      Montalais is destined, before a month is over, to become the first
      diplomatist in the court of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, but on condition that I shall be the second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed; an offensive and defensive alliance, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only be very careful of any letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will hand them to you as I receive them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we tell the king about Madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Madame is still in love with his majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we tell Madame about the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she would be exceedingly wrong not to humor him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we tell La Valliere about Madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever we choose, for La Valliere is in our power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, through the Vicomte de Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not forget, I hope, that Monsieur de Bragelonne has written many
      letters to Mademoiselle de la Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it was I who received, and I who intercepted those letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, consequently, it is you who have them still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where,&mdash;here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I have them safe at Blois, in the little room you know well
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That dear little room,&mdash;that darling little room, the ante-chamber
      of the palace I intend you to live in one of these days. But, I beg your
      pardon, you said that all those letters are in that little room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not put them in a box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; in the same box where I put all the letters I received from
      you, and where I put mine also when your business or your amusements
      prevented you from coming to our rendezvous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, very good,&rdquo; said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I see there is a possibility of not having to run to Blois after
      the letters, for I have them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have brought the box away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very dear to me, because it belonged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure and take care of it, for it contains original documents that will
      be of priceless value by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly well aware of that indeed, and that is the very reason why
      I laugh as I do, and with all my heart, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, one last word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why <i>last?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we need any one to assist us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valets or maid-servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad policy. You will give the letters,&mdash;you will receive them. Oh!
      we must have no pride in this affair, otherwise M. Malicorne and
      Mademoiselle Aure, not transacting their own affairs themselves, will have
      to make up their minds to see them done by others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right; but what is going on yonder in M. de Guiche&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; he is only opening his window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be gone.&rdquo; And they both immediately disappeared, all the terms of
      the contract being agreed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window just opened was, in fact, that of the Comte de Guiche. It was
      not alone with the hope of catching a glimpse of Madame through her
      curtains that he seated himself by the open window for his preoccupation
      of mind had at that time a different origin. He had just received, as we
      have already stated, the courier who had been dispatched to him by
      Bragelonne, the latter having written to De Guiche a letter which had made
      the deepest impression upon him, and which he had read over and over
      again. &ldquo;Strange, strange!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;How irresponsible are the means
      by which destiny hurries men onward to their fate!&rdquo; Leaving the window in
      order to approach nearer to the light, he once more read the letter he had
      just received:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CALAIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR COUNT,&mdash;I found M. de Wardes at Calais; he has been
      seriously wounded in an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. De Wardes is,
      as you know, unquestionably brave, but full of malevolent and wicked
      feelings. He conversed with me about yourself, for whom, he says, he has a
      warm regard, also about Madame, whom he considers a beautiful and amiable
      woman. He has guessed your affection for a certain person. He also talked
      to me about the lady for whom I have so ardent a regard, and showed the
      greatest interest on my behalf in expressing a deep pity for me,
      accompanied, however, by dark hints which alarmed me at first, but which I
      at last looked upon as the result of his usual love of mystery. These are
      the facts: he had received news of the court; you will understand,
      however, that it was only through M. de Lorraine. The report goes, so says
      the news, that a change has taken place in the king&rsquo;s affections. You know
      whom that concerns. Afterwards, the news continues, people are talking
      about one of the maids of honor, respecting whom various slanderous
      reports are being circulated. These vague phrases have not allowed me to
      sleep. I have been deploring, ever since yesterday, that my diffidence and
      vacillation of purpose, notwithstanding a certain obstinacy of character I
      may possess, have left me unable to reply to these insinuations. In a
      word, M. de Wardes was setting off for Paris, and I did not delay his
      departure with explanations; for it seemed rather hard, I confess, to
      cross-examine a man whose wounds are hardly yet closed. In short, he
      travelled by short stages, as he was anxious to leave, he said, in order
      to be present at a curious spectacle the court cannot fail to offer within
      a short time. He added a few congratulatory words accompanied by vague
      sympathizing expressions. I could not understand the one any more than the
      other. I was bewildered by my own thoughts, and tormented by a mistrust of
      this man,&mdash;a mistrust which, you know better than any one else, I
      have never been able to overcome. As soon as he left, my perceptions
      seemed to become clearer. It is hardly possible that a man of De Wardes&rsquo;s
      character should not have communicated something of his own malicious
      nature to the statements he made to me. It is not unlikely, therefore,
      that in the strange hints De Wardes threw out in my presence, there may be
      a mysterious signification, which I might have some difficulty in applying
      either to myself or to some one with whom you are acquainted. Being
      compelled to leave as soon as possible, in obedience to the king&rsquo;s
      commands, the idea did not occur to me of running after De Wardes in order
      to ask him to explain his reserve; but I have dispatched a courier to you
      with this letter, which will explain in detail my various doubts. I regard
      you as myself; you have reflected and observed; it will be for you to act.
      M. de Wardes will arrive very shortly; endeavor to learn what he meant, if
      you do not already know. M. de Wardes, moreover, pretended that the Duke
      of Buckingham left Paris on the very best of terms with Madame. This was
      an affair which would have unhesitatingly made me draw my sword, had I not
      felt that I was under the necessity of dispatching the king&rsquo;s mission
      before undertaking any quarrel whatsoever. Burn this letter, which Olivain
      will hand you. Whatever Olivain says, you may confidently rely on. Will
      you have the goodness, my dear comte, to recall me to the remembrance of
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere, whose hands I kiss with the greatest respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your devoted
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DE BRAGELONNE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;If anything serious should happen&mdash;we should be prepared
      for everything, dispatch a courier to me with this one single word,
      &lsquo;come,&rsquo; and I will be in Paris within six and thirty hours after the
      receipt of your letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche sighed, folded up the letter a third time, and, instead of
      burning it, as Raoul had recommended him to do, placed it in his pocket.
      He felt it needed reading over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much distress of mind, yet what sublime confidence, he shows!&rdquo;
       murmured the comte; &ldquo;he has poured out his whole soul in this letter. He
      says nothing of the Comte de la Fere, and speaks of his respect for
      Louise. He cautions me on my own account, and entreats me on his. Ah!&rdquo;
       continued De Guiche, with a threatening gesture, &ldquo;you interfere in my
      affairs, Monsieur de Wardes, do you? Very well, then; I will shortly
      occupy myself with yours. As for you, poor Raoul,&mdash;you who intrust
      your heart to my keeping, be assured I will watch over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this promise, De Guiche begged Malicorne to come immediately to his
      apartments, if possible. Malicorne acknowledged the invitation with an
      activity which was the first result of his conversation with Montalais.
      And while De Guiche, who thought that his motive was undiscovered,
      cross-examined Malicorne, the latter, who appeared to be working in the
      dark, soon guessed his questioner&rsquo;s motives. The consequence was, that,
      after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s conversation, during which De Guiche thought
      he had ascertained the whole truth with regard to La Valliere and the
      king, he had learned absolutely nothing more than his own eyes had already
      acquainted him with, while Malicorne learned, or guessed, that Raoul, who
      was absent, was fast becoming suspicious, and that De Guiche intended to
      watch over the treasure of the Hesperides. Malicorne accepted the office
      of dragon. De Guiche fancied he had done everything for his friend, and
      soon began to think of nothing but his personal affairs. The next evening,
      De Wardes&rsquo;s return and first appearance at the king&rsquo;s reception were
      announced. When that visit had been paid, the convalescent waited on
      Monsieur; De Guiche taking care, however, to be at Monsieur&rsquo;s apartments
      before the visit took place.

    <h2>
      Chapter XII. How De Wardes Was Received at Court.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monsieur had received De Wardes with that marked favor light and frivolous
      minds bestow on every novelty that comes in their way. De Wardes, who had
      been absent for a month, was like fresh fruit to him. To treat him with
      marked kindness was an infidelity to old friends, and there is always
      something fascinating in that; moreover, it was a sort of reparation to De
      Wardes himself. Nothing, consequently, could exceed the favorable notice
      Monsieur took of him. The Chevalier de Lorraine, who feared this rival but
      a little, but who respected a character and disposition only too parallel
      to his own in every particular, with the addition of a bull-dog courage he
      did not himself possess, received De Wardes with a greater display of
      regard and affection than even Monsieur had done. De Guiche, as we have
      said, was there also, but kept in the background, waiting very patiently
      until all these interchanges were over. De Wardes, while talking to the
      others, and even to Monsieur himself, had not for a moment lost sight of
      De Guiche, who, he instinctively felt, was there on his account. As soon
      as he had finished with the others, he went up to De Guiche. They
      exchanged the most courteous compliments, after which De Wardes returned
      to Monsieur and the other gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these congratulations Madame was announced. She had been
      informed of De Wardes&rsquo;s arrival, and knowing all the details of his voyage
      and duel, she was not sorry to be present at the remarks she knew would be
      made, without delay, by one who, she felt assured, was her personal enemy.
      Two or three of her ladies accompanied her. De Wardes saluted Madame in
      the most graceful and respectful manner, and, as a commencement of
      hostilities, announced, in the first place, that he could furnish the Duke
      of Buckingham&rsquo;s friends with the latest news about him. This was a direct
      answer to the coldness with which Madame had received him. The attack was
      a vigorous one, and Madame felt the blow, but without appearing to have
      even noticed it. He rapidly cast a glance at Monsieur and at De Guiche,&mdash;the
      former colored, and the latter turned very pale. Madame alone preserved an
      unmoved countenance; but, as she knew how many unpleasant thoughts and
      feelings her enemy could awaken in the two persons who were listening to
      him, she smilingly bent forward towards the traveler, as if to listen to
      the news he had brought&mdash;but he was speaking of other matters. Madame
      was brave, even to imprudence; if she were to retreat, it would be
      inviting an attack; so, after the first disagreeable impression had passed
      away, she returned to the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you suffered much from your wounds, Monsieur de Wardes?&rdquo; she
      inquired, &ldquo;for we have been told that you had the misfortune to get
      wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now De Wardes&rsquo;s turn to wince; he bit his lips, and replied, &ldquo;No,
      Madame, hardly at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! and yet in this terribly hot weather&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sea-breezes were very fresh and cool, Madame, and then I had one
      consolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knowledge that my adversary&rsquo;s sufferings were still greater than my
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you mean he was more seriously wounded than you were; I was not aware
      of that,&rdquo; said the princess, with utter indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Madame, you are mistaken, or rather you pretend to misunderstand my
      remark. I did not say that he was a greater sufferer in body than myself;
      but his heart was very seriously affected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche comprehended instinctively from what direction the struggle was
      approaching; he ventured to make a sign to Madame, as if entreating her to
      retire from the contest. But she, without acknowledging De Guiche&rsquo;s
      gesture, without pretending to have noticed it even, and still smiling,
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s heart was
      touched? I had no idea, until now, that a heart-wound could be cured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Madame,&rdquo; replied De Wardes, politely, &ldquo;every woman believes that;
      and it is this belief that gives them that superiority to man which
      confidence begets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misunderstand altogether, dearest,&rdquo; said the prince, impatiently; &ldquo;M.
      de Wardes means that the Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s heart had been touched, not
      by the sword, but by something sharper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! very good, very good!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame. &ldquo;It is a jest of M. de
      Wardes&rsquo;s. Very good; but I should like to know if the Duke of Buckingham
      would appreciate the jest. It is, indeed, a very great pity he is not
      here, M. de Wardes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s eyes seemed to flash fire. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, as he clenched
      his teeth, &ldquo;there is nothing I should like better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche did not move. Madame seemed to expect that he would come to her
      assistance. Monsieur hesitated. The Chevalier de Lorraine advanced and
      continued the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;De Wardes knows perfectly well that for a Buckingham&rsquo;s
      heart to be touched is nothing new, and what he has said has already taken
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of an ally, I have two enemies,&rdquo; murmured Madame; &ldquo;two determined
      enemies, and in league with each other.&rdquo; And she changed the conversation.
      To change the conversation is, as every one knows, a right possessed by
      princes which etiquette requires all to respect. The remainder of the
      conversation was moderate enough in tone; the principal actors had
      rehearsed their parts. Madame withdrew easily, and Monsieur, who wished to
      question her on several matters, offered her his hand on leaving. The
      chevalier was seriously afraid that an understanding might be established
      between the husband and wife if he were to leave them quietly together. He
      therefore made his way to Monsieur&rsquo;s apartments, in order to surprise him
      on his return, and to destroy with a few words all the good impressions
      Madame might have been able to sow in his heart. De Guiche advanced
      towards De Wardes, who was surrounded by a large number of persons, and
      thereby indicated his wish to converse with him; De Wardes, at the same
      time, showing by his looks and by a movement of his head that he perfectly
      understood him. There was nothing in these signs to enable strangers to
      suppose they were otherwise than upon the most friendly footing. De Guiche
      could therefore turn away from him, and wait until he was at liberty. He
      had not long to wait; for De Wardes, freed from his questioners,
      approached De Guiche, and after a fresh salutation, they walked side by
      side together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made a good impression since your return, my dear De Wardes,&rdquo;
       said the comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, as you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your spirits are just as lively as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very great happiness, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Everything is so ridiculous in this world, everything so absurd
      around us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are of my opinion, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so! And what news do you bring us from yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? None at all. I have come to look for news here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, tell me, you surely must have seen some people at Boulogne, one of
      our friends, for instance; it is no great time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people&mdash;one of our friends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your memory is short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! true; Bragelonne, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was on his way to fulfil a mission, with which he was intrusted to
      King Charles II.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Well, then, did he not tell you, or did not you tell him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not precisely know what I told him, I must confess: but I do know
      what I did <i>not</i> tell him.&rdquo; De Wardes was <i>finesse</i> itself. He
      perfectly well knew from De Guiche&rsquo;s tone and manner, which was cold and
      dignified, that the conversation was about to assume a disagreeable turn.
      He resolved to let it take what course it pleased, and to keep strictly on
      his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask you what you did not tell him?&rdquo; inquired De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All about La Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Valliere... What is it? and what was that strange circumstance you
      seem to have known over yonder, which Bragelonne, who was here on the
      spot, was not acquainted with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really ask me that in a serious manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you, a member of the court, living in Madame&rsquo;s household, a friend
      of Monsieur&rsquo;s, a guest at their table, the favorite of our lovely
      princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guiche colored violently from anger. &ldquo;What princess are you alluding to?&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only acquainted with one, my dear fellow. I am speaking of Madame
      herself. Are you devoted to another princess, then? Come, tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche was on the point of launching out, but he saw the drift of the
      remark. A quarrel was imminent between the two young men. De Wardes wished
      the quarrel to be only in Madame&rsquo;s name, while De Guiche would not accept
      it except on La Valliere&rsquo;s account. From this moment, it became a series
      of feigned attacks, which would have continued until one of the two had
      been touched home. De Guiche therefore resumed all the self-possession he
      could command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not the slightest question in the world of Madame in this
      matter, my dear De Wardes.&rdquo; said Guiche, &ldquo;but simply of what you were
      talking about just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was I saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you had concealed certain things from Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain things which you know as well as I do,&rdquo; replied De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, upon my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you tell me what they are, I shall know, but not otherwise, I swear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! I who have just arrived from a distance of sixty leagues, and you
      who have not stirred from this place, who have witnessed with your own
      eyes that which rumor informed me of at Calais! Do you now tell me
      seriously that you do not know what it is about? Oh! comte, this is hardly
      charitable of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like, De Wardes; but I again repeat, I know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are truly discreet&mdash;well!&mdash;perhaps it is very prudent of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you will not tell me anything, will not tell me any more than you
      told Bragelonne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pretending to be deaf, I see. I am convinced that Madame could
      not possibly have more command over herself than <i>you</i> have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Double hypocrite,&rdquo; murmured Guiche to himself, &ldquo;you are again returning
      to the old subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; continued De Wardes, &ldquo;since we find it so difficult to
      understand each other about La Valliere and Bragelonne let us speak about
      your own affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said De Guiche, &ldquo;I have no affairs of my own to talk about. You
      have not said anything about me, I suppose, to Bragelonne, which you
      cannot repeat to my face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but understand me, Guiche, that however much I may be ignorant of
      certain matters, I am quite as conversant with others. If, for instance,
      we were conversing about the intimacies of the Duke of Buckingham at
      Paris, as I did during my journey with the duke, I could tell you a great
      many interesting circumstances. Would you like me to mention them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche passed his hand across his forehead, which was covered in
      perspiration. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a hundred times no! I have no curiosity
      for matters which do not concern me. The Duke of Buckingham is for me
      nothing more than a simple acquaintance, whilst Raoul is an intimate
      friend. I have not the slightest curiosity to learn what happened to the
      duke, while I have, on the contrary, the greatest interest in all that
      happened to Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in Paris, or Boulogne. You understand I am on the spot; if anything
      should happen, I am here to meet it; whilst Raoul is absent, and has only
      myself to represent him; so, Raoul&rsquo;s affairs before my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he will return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not, however, until his mission is completed. In the meantime, you
      understand, evil reports cannot be permitted to circulate about him
      without my looking into them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for a better reason still, that he will remain some time in London,&rdquo;
       said De Wardes, chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so,&rdquo; said De Guiche, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think so, indeed! do you suppose he was sent to London for no other
      purpose than to go there and return again immediately? No, no; he was sent
      to London to remain there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! De Wardes,&rdquo; said De Guiche, grasping De Wardes&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;that is a
      very serious suspicion concerning Bragelonne, which completely confirms
      what he wrote to me from Boulogne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes resumed his former coldness of manner: his love of raillery had
      led him too far, and by his own imprudence, he had laid himself open to
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell me, what did he write to you about?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that you had artfully insinuated some injurious remarks
      against La Valliere, and that you had seemed to laugh at his great
      confidence in that young girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is perfectly true I did so,&rdquo; said De Wardes, &ldquo;and I was quite
      ready, at the time, to hear from the Vicomte de Bragelonne that which
      every man expects from another whenever anything may have been said to
      displease him. In the same way, for instance, if I were seeking a quarrel
      with you, I should tell you that Madame after having shown the greatest
      preference for the Duke of Buckingham, is at this moment supposed to have
      sent the handsome duke away for your benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that would not wound me in the slightest degree, my dear De Wardes,&rdquo;
       said De Guiche, smiling, notwithstanding the shiver that ran through his
      whole frame. &ldquo;Why, such a favor would be too great a happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit that, but if I absolutely wished to quarrel with you, I should
      try and invent a falsehood, perhaps, and speak to you about a certain
      arbor, where you and that illustrious princess were together&mdash;I
      should speak also of certain gratifications, of certain kissings of the
      hand; and you who are so secret on all occasions, so hasty, so punctilious&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said De Guiche, interrupting him, with a smile upon his lips,
      although he almost felt as if he were going to die; &ldquo;I swear I should not
      care for that, nor should I in any way contradict you; for you must know,
      my dear marquis, that for all matters which concern myself I am a block of
      ice; but it is a very different thing when an absent friend is concerned,
      a friend, who, on leaving, confided his interests to my safe-keeping; for
      such a friend, De Wardes, believe me, I am like fire itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, Monsieur de Guiche. In spite of what you say, there
      cannot be any question between us, just now, either of Bragelonne or of
      this insignificant girl, whose name is La Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment some of the younger courtiers were crossing the apartment,
      and having already heard the few words which had just been pronounced,
      were able also to hear those which were about to follow. De Wardes
      observed this, and continued aloud:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! if La Valliere were a
      coquette like Madame, whose innocent flirtations, I am sure, were, first
      of all, the cause of the Duke of Buckingham being sent back to England,
      and afterwards were the reason of your being sent into exile; for you will
      not deny, I suppose, that Madame&rsquo;s pretty ways really had a certain
      influence over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The courtiers drew nearer to the speakers, Saint-Aignan at their head, and
      then Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow, whose fault was that?&rdquo; said De Guiche, laughing. &ldquo;I
      am a vain, conceited fellow, I know, and everybody else knows it too. I
      took seriously that which was only intended as a jest, and got myself
      exiled for my pains. But I saw my error. I overcame my vanity, and I
      obtained my recall, by making the <i>amende honorable</i>, and by
      promising myself to overcome this defect; and the consequence is, that I
      am so thoroughly cured, that I now laugh at the very thing which, three or
      four days ago, would have almost broken my heart. But Raoul is in love,
      and is loved in return; he cannot laugh at the reports which disturb his
      happiness&mdash;reports which you seem to have undertaken to interpret,
      when you know, marquis, as I do, as these gentlemen do, as every one does
      in fact, that all such reports are pure calumny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calumny!&rdquo; exclaimed De Wardes, furious at seeing himself caught in the
      snare by De Guiche&rsquo;s coolness of temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;calumny. Look at this letter from him, in which he tells
      me you have spoken ill of Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and where he asks
      me, if what you reported about this young girl is true or not. Do you wish
      me to appeal to these gentlemen, De Wardes, to decide?&rdquo; And with admirable
      coolness, De Guiche read aloud the paragraph of the letter which referred
      to La Valliere. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued De Guiche, &ldquo;there is no doubt in the
      world, as far as I am concerned, that you wished to disturb Bragelonne&rsquo;s
      peace of mind, and that your remarks were maliciously intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes looked round him, to see if he could find support from any one;
      but, at the idea that De Wardes had insulted, either directly or
      indirectly, the idol of the day, every one shook his head; and De Wardes
      saw that he was in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; said De Guiche, intuitively divining the general feeling, &ldquo;my
      discussion with Monsieur de Wardes refers to a subject so delicate in its
      nature, that it is most important no one should hear more than you have
      already heard. Close the doors, then, I beg you, and let us finish our
      conversation in the manner which becomes two gentlemen, one of whom has
      given the other the lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, messieurs!&rdquo; exclaimed those who were present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your opinion, then, that I was wrong in defending Mademoiselle de
      la Valliere?&rdquo; said De Guiche. &ldquo;In that case, I pass judgment upon myself,
      and am ready to withdraw the offensive words I may have used to Monsieur
      de Wardes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! certainly not!&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan. &ldquo;Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere is an angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Virtue and purity itself,&rdquo; said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Monsieur de Wardes,&rdquo; said De Guiche, &ldquo;I am not the only one who
      undertakes the defense of that poor girl. I entreat you, therefore,
      messieurs, a second time, to leave us. You see, it is impossible we could
      be more calm and composed than we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the very thing the courtiers wished; some went out at one door, and
      the rest at the other, and the two young men were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well played,&rdquo; said De Wardes, to the comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not?&rdquo; replied the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it be wondered at, my dear fellow; I have got quite rusty in the
      country, while the command you have acquired over yourself, comte,
      confounds me; a man always gains something in women&rsquo;s society; so, pray
      accept my congratulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do accept them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will make Madame a present of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear Monsieur de Wardes, let us speak as loud as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not defy me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do defy you, for you are known to be an evil-minded man; if you do
      that, you will be looked upon as a coward, too; and Monsieur would have
      you hanged, this evening, at his window-casement. Speak, my dear De
      Wardes, speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fought already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not quite enough, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, you would not be sorry to fight with me while my wounds are still
      open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; better still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! you are unfortunate in the moment you have chosen; a duel,
      after the one I have just fought, would hardly suit me; I have lost too
      much blood at Boulogne; at the slightest effort my wounds would open
      again, and you would really have too good a bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said De Guiche; &ldquo;and yet, on your arrival here, your looks and
      your arms showed there was nothing the matter with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my arms are all right, but my legs are weak; and then, I have not
      had a foil in my hand since that devil of a duel; and you, I am sure, have
      been fencing every day, in order to carry your little conspiracy against
      me to a successful issue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honor, monsieur,&rdquo; replied De Guiche, &ldquo;it is six months since I
      last practiced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, comte, after due reflection, I will not fight, at least, with you. I
      will await Bragelonne&rsquo;s return, since you say it is Bragelonne who finds
      fault with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, indeed! You shall not wait until Bragelonne&rsquo;s return,&rdquo; exclaimed
      the comte, losing all command over himself, &ldquo;for you have said that
      Bragelonne might, possibly, be some time before he returns; and, in the
      meanwhile, your wicked insinuations would have had their effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, I shall have my excuse. So take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you a week to finish your recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better. We will wait a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand; a week will give time to my adversary to make his
      escape. No, no; I will not give you one day, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad, monsieur,&rdquo; said De Wardes, retreating a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are a coward, if you do not fight willingly. Nay, what is more, I
      will denounce you to the king, as having refused to fight, after having
      insulted La Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said De Wardes, &ldquo;you are dangerously treacherous, though you pass
      for a man of honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing more dangerous than the treachery, as you term it, of
      the man whose conduct is always loyal and upright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Restore me the use of my legs, then, or get yourself bled, till you are
      as white as I am, so as to equalize our chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I have something better than that to propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will fight on horseback, and will exchange three pistol-shots each.
      You are a first rate marksman. I have seen you bring down swallows with
      single balls, and at full gallop. Do not deny it, for I have seen you
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; said De Wardes; &ldquo;and as that is the case, it is
      not unlikely I might kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be rendering me a very great service, if you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it agreed? Give me your hand upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is: but on one condition, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That not a word shall be said about it to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word, I swear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and get my horse, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the plain; I know an admirable place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And both of them, on their way to the stables, passed beneath Madame&rsquo;s
      windows, which were faintly lighted; a shadow could be seen behind the
      lace curtains. &ldquo;There is a woman,&rdquo; said De Wardes, smiling, &ldquo;who does not
      suspect that we are going to fight&mdash;to die, perhaps, on her account.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII. The Combat.
    </h2>
    <p>
      De Wardes and De Guiche selected their horses, and saddled them with their
      own hands, with holster saddles. De Guiche, having two pairs of pistols,
      went to his apartments to get them; and after having loaded them, gave the
      choice to De Wardes, who selected the pair he had made use of twenty times
      before&mdash;the same, indeed, with which De Guiche had seen him kill
      swallows flying. &ldquo;You will not be surprised,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I take every
      precaution. You know the weapons well, and, consequently, I am only making
      the chances equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your remark was quite useless,&rdquo; replied De Guiche, &ldquo;and you have done no
      more than you are entitled to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said De Wardes, &ldquo;I beg you to have the goodness to help me to
      mount; for I still experience a little difficulty in doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, we had better settle the matter on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; once in the saddle, I shall be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then; we will not speak of it again,&rdquo; said De Guiche, as he
      assisted De Wardes to mount his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued the young man, &ldquo;in our eagerness to murder one
      another, we have neglected one circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it is quite dark, and we shall almost be obliged to grope about, in
      order to kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said De Guiche, &ldquo;you are as anxious as I am that everything should
      be done in proper order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I do not wish people to say that you have assassinated me, any
      more than, supposing I were to kill you, I should myself like to be
      accused of such a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any one make a similar remark about your duel with the Duke of
      Buckingham?&rdquo; said De Guiche; &ldquo;it took place precisely under the same
      conditions as ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true; but there was still light enough to see by; and we were up to
      our middles almost, in the water; besides, there were a good number of
      spectators on shore, looking at us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche reflected for a moment; and the thought which had already
      presented itself to him became more confirmed&mdash;that De Wardes wished
      to have witnesses present, in order to bring back the conversation about
      Madame, and to give a new turn to the combat. He avoided saying a word in
      reply, therefore; and, as De Wardes once more looked at him
      interrogatively, he replied, by a movement of the head, that it would be
      best to let things remain as they were. The two adversaries consequently
      set off, and left the chateau by the same gate, close to which we may
      remember to have seen Montalais and Malicorne together. The night, as if
      to counteract the extreme heat of the day, had gathered the clouds
      together in masses which were moving slowly along from the west to the
      east. The vault above, without a clear spot anywhere visible, or without
      the faintest indication of thunder, seemed to hang heavily over the earth,
      and soon began, by the force of the wind, to split into streamers, like a
      huge sheet torn to shreds. Large and warm drops of rain began to fall
      heavily, and gathered the dust into globules, which rolled along the
      ground. At the same time, the hedges, which seemed conscious of the
      approaching storm, the thirsty plants, the drooping branches of the trees,
      exhaled a thousand aromatic odors, which revived in the mind tender
      recollections, thoughts of youth, endless life, happiness, and love. &ldquo;How
      fresh the earth smells,&rdquo; said De Wardes; &ldquo;it is a piece of coquetry to
      draw us to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; replied De Guiche, &ldquo;several ideas have just occurred to me;
      and I wish to have your opinion upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relative to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relative to our engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite some time, in fact, that we should begin to arrange matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it to be an ordinary combat, and conducted according to established
      custom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me first know what your established custom is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we dismount in any particular open space that may suit us, fasten
      our horses to the nearest object, meet, each without our pistols in our
      hands, and afterwards retire for a hundred and fifty paces, in order to
      advance on each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; that is precisely the way in which I killed poor Follivent,
      three weeks ago, at Saint-Denis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but you forgot one circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That in your duel with Follivent you advanced towards each other on foot,
      your swords between your teeth, and your pistols in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While now, on the contrary, as you cannot walk, you yourself admit that
      we shall have to mount our horses again, and charge; and the first who
      wishes to fire will do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the best course, no doubt; but it is quite dark; we must make
      allowances for more missed shots than would be the case in the daytime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; each will fire three times; the pair of pistols already
      loaded, and one reload.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! Where shall our engagement take place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any preference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that small wood which lies before us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wood which is called Rochin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that there is an open glade in the center?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this glade is admirably adapted for such a purpose, with a variety
      of roads, by-places, paths, ditches, windings, and avenues. We could not
      find a better spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied, if you are so. We are at our destination, if I
      am not mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Look at the beautiful open space in the center. The faint light
      which the stars afford seems concentrated in this spot; the woods which
      surround it seem, with their barriers, to form its natural limits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Do as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us first settle the conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are mine; if you have any objection to make you will state it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the horse be killed, its rider will be obliged to fight on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a matter of course, since we have no change of horses here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that does not oblige his adversary to dismount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His adversary will, in fact, be free to act as he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The adversaries, having once met in close contact, cannot quit each other
      under any circumstances, and may, consequently, fire muzzle to muzzle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three shots and no more will do, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sufficient, I think. Here are powder and balls for your pistols;
      measure out three charges, take three balls, I will do the same; then we
      will throw the rest of the powder and balls away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we will solemnly swear,&rdquo; said De Wardes, &ldquo;that we have neither balls
      nor powder about us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed; and I swear it,&rdquo; said De Guiche, holding his hand towards heaven,
      a gesture which De Wardes imitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear comte,&rdquo; said De Wardes, &ldquo;allow me to tell you that I am
      in no way your dupe. You already are, or soon will be, the accepted lover
      of Madame. I have detected your secret, and you are afraid I shall tell
      others of it. You wish to kill me, to insure my silence; that is very
      clear; and in your place, I should do the same.&rdquo; De Guiche hung down his
      head. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; continued De Wardes, triumphantly, &ldquo;was it really worth
      while, tell me, to throw this affair of Bragelonne&rsquo;s on my shoulders? But,
      take care, my dear fellow; in bringing the wild boar to bay, you enrage
      him to madness; in running down the fox, you endow him with the ferocity
      of the jaguar. The consequence is, that brought to bay by you, I shall
      defend myself to the very last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be quite right to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but take care; I shall work more harm than you think. In the first
      place, as a beginning, you will readily suppose that I have not been
      absurd enough to lock up my secret, or your secret rather, in my own
      breast. There is a friend of mine, who resembles me in every way, a man
      whom you know very well, who shares my secret with me; so, pray
      understand, that if you kill me, my death will not have been of much
      service to you; whilst, on the contrary, if I kill you&mdash;and
      everything is possible, you know&mdash;you understand?&rdquo; De Guiche
      shuddered. &ldquo;If I kill you,&rdquo; continued De Wardes, &ldquo;you will have secured
      two mortal enemies to Madame, who will do their very utmost to ruin her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur,&rdquo; exclaimed De Guiche, furiously, &ldquo;do not reckon upon my
      death so easily. Of the two enemies you speak of, I trust most heartily to
      dispose of one immediately, and the other at the earliest opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only reply De Wardes made was a burst of laughter, so diabolical in
      its sound, that a superstitious man would have been terrified. But De
      Guiche was not so impressionable as that. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
      everything is now settled, Monsieur de Wardes; so have the goodness to
      take your place first, unless you would prefer me to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said De Wardes. &ldquo;I shall be delighted to save you the
      slightest trouble.&rdquo; And spurring his horse to a gallop, he crossed the
      wide open space, and took his stand at that point of the circumference of
      the cross-road immediately opposite to where De Guiche was stationed. De
      Guiche remained motionless. At this distance of a hundred paces, the two
      adversaries were absolutely invisible to each other, being completely
      concealed by the thick shade of elms and chestnuts. A minute elapsed
      amidst the profoundest silence. At the end of the minute, each of them, in
      the deep shade in which he was concealed, heard the double click of the
      trigger, as they put the pistols on full cock. De Guiche, adopting the
      usual tactics, put his horse to a gallop, persuaded that he should render
      his safety doubly sure by the movement, as well as by the speed of the
      animal. He directed his course in a straight line towards the point where,
      in his opinion, De Wardes would be stationed; and he expected to meet De
      Wardes about half-way; but in this he was mistaken. He continued his
      course, presuming that his adversary was impatiently awaiting his
      approach. When, however, he had gone about two-thirds of the distance, he
      beheld the trees suddenly illuminated and a ball flew by, cutting the
      plume of his hat in two. Nearly at the same moment, and as if the flash of
      the first shot had served to indicate the direction of the other, a second
      report was heard, and a second ball passed through the head of De Guiche&rsquo;s
      horse, a little below the ear. The animal fell. These two reports,
      proceeding from the very opposite direction in which he expected to find
      De Wardes, surprised him a great deal; but as he was a man of amazing
      self-possession, he prepared himself for his horse falling, but not so
      completely, however, that the toe of his boot escaped being caught under
      the animal as it fell. Very fortunately the horse in its dying agonies
      moved so as to enable him to release the leg which was less entangled than
      the other. De Guiche rose, felt himself all over, and found that he was
      not wounded. At the very moment he had felt the horse tottering under him,
      he placed his pistols in the holsters, afraid that the force of the fall
      might explode one at least, if not both of them, by which he would have
      been disarmed, and left utterly without defense. Once on his feet, he took
      the pistols out of the holsters, and advanced towards the spot where, by
      the light of the flash, he had seen De Wardes appear. De Wardes had, at
      the first shot, accounted for the maneuver, than which nothing could have
      been simpler. Instead of advancing to meet De Guiche, or remaining in his
      place to await his approach, De Wardes had, for about fifteen paces,
      followed the circle of the shadow which hid him from his adversary&rsquo;s
      observation, and at the very moment when the latter presented his flank in
      his career, he had fired from the place where he stood, carefully taking
      aim, and assisted instead of being inconvenienced by the horse&rsquo;s gallop.
      It has been seen that, notwithstanding the darkness, the first ball passed
      hardly more than an inch above De Guiche&rsquo;s head. De Wardes had so
      confidently relied upon his aim, that he thought he had seen De Guiche
      fall; his astonishment was extreme when he saw he still remained erect in
      his saddle. He hastened to fire his second shot, but his hand trembled,
      and he killed the horse instead. It would be a most fortunate chance for
      him if De Guiche were to remain held fast under the animal. Before he
      could have freed himself, De Wardes would have loaded his pistol and had
      De Guiche at his mercy. But De Guiche, on the contrary, was up, and had
      three shots to fire. De Guiche immediately understood the position of
      affairs. It would be necessary to exceed De Wardes in rapidity of
      execution. He advanced, therefore, so as to reach him before he should
      have had time to reload his pistol. De Wardes saw him approaching like a
      tempest. The ball was rather tight, and offered some resistance to the
      ramrod. To load carelessly would be simply to lose his last chance; to
      take the proper care in loading meant fatal loss of time, or rather,
      throwing away his life. He made his horse bound on one side. De Guiche
      turned round also, and, at the moment the horse was quiet again, fired,
      and the ball carried off De Wardes&rsquo;s hat from his head. De Wardes now knew
      that he had a moment&rsquo;s time at his own disposal; he availed himself of it
      in order to finish loading his pistol. De Guiche, noticing that his
      adversary did not fall, threw the pistol he had just discharged aside, and
      walked straight towards De Wardes, elevating the second pistol as he did
      so. He had hardly proceeded more than two or three paces, when De Wardes
      took aim at him as he was walking, and fired. An exclamation of anger was
      De Guiche&rsquo;s answer; the comte&rsquo;s arm contracted and dropped motionless by
      his side, and the pistol fell from his grasp. His anxiety was excessive.
      &ldquo;I am lost,&rdquo; murmured De Wardes, &ldquo;he is not mortally wounded.&rdquo; At the very
      moment, however, De Guiche was about to raise his pistol against De
      Wardes, the head, shoulders, and limbs of the comte seemed to collapse. He
      heaved a deep-drawn sigh, tottered, and fell at the feet of De Wardes&rsquo;s
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; said De Wardes, and gathering up the reins, he struck
      his spurs into the horse&rsquo;s sides. The horse cleared the comte&rsquo;s motionless
      body, and bore De Wardes rapidly back to the chateau. When he arrived
      there, he remained a quarter of an hour deliberating within himself as to
      the proper course to be adopted. In his impatience to leave the field of
      battle, he had omitted to ascertain whether De Guiche were dead or not. A
      double hypothesis presented itself to De Wardes&rsquo;s agitated mind; either De
      Guiche was killed, or De Guiche was wounded only. If he were killed, why
      should he leave his body in that manner to the tender mercies of the
      wolves; it was a perfectly useless piece of cruelty, for if De Guiche were
      dead, he certainly could not breathe a syllable of what had passed; if he
      were not killed, why should he, De Wardes, in leaving him there uncared
      for, allow himself to be regarded as a savage, incapable of one generous
      feeling? This last consideration determined his line of conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes immediately instituted inquires after Manicamp. He was told that
      Manicamp had been looking after De Guiche, and, not knowing where to find
      him, had retired to bed. De Wardes went and awoke the sleeper, without any
      delay, and related the whole affair to him, which Manicamp listened to in
      perfect silence, but with an expression of momentarily increasing energy,
      of which his face could hardly have been supposed capable. It was only
      when De Wardes had finished, that Manicamp uttered the words, &ldquo;Let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they proceeded, Manicamp became more and more excited, and in
      proportion as De Wardes related the details of the affair to him, his
      countenance assumed every moment a darker expression. &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he said,
      when De Wardes had finished, &ldquo;you think he is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you fought in that manner, without witnesses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He insisted upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very singular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by saying it is singular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it is very unlike Monsieur de Guiche&rsquo;s disposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not doubt my word, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! hum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do doubt it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little. But I shall doubt it more than ever, I warn you, if I find the
      poor fellow is really dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Manicamp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Wardes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems you intend to insult me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you please. The fact is, I never did like people who come and
      say, &lsquo;I have killed such and such a gentleman in a corner; it is a great
      pity, but I killed him in a perfectly honorable manner.&rsquo; It has an ugly
      appearance, M. de Wardes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! we have arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the glade could now be seen, and in the open space lay the
      motionless body of the dead horse. To the right of the horse, upon the
      dark grass, with his face against the ground, the poor comte lay, bathed
      in his blood. He had remained in the same spot, and did not even seem to
      have made the slightest movement. Manicamp threw himself on his knees,
      lifted the comte in his arms, and found him quite cold, and steeped in
      blood. He let him gently fall again. Then, stretching out his hand and
      feeling all over the ground close to where the comte lay, he sought until
      he found De Guiche&rsquo;s pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; he said, rising to his feet, pale as death and with the
      pistol in his hand, &ldquo;you are not mistaken, he is quite dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; repeated De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and his pistol is still loaded,&rdquo; added Manicamp, looking into the
      pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I told you that I took aim as he was walking towards me, and fired at
      him at the very moment he was going to fire at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure that you fought with him, Monsieur de Wardes? I
      confess that I am very much afraid it has been a foul assassination. Nay,
      nay, no exclamations! You have had your three shots, and his pistol is
      still loaded. You have killed his horse, and he, De Guiche, one of the
      best marksmen in France, has not touched even either your horse or
      yourself. Well, Monsieur de Wardes, you have been very unlucky in bringing
      me here; all the blood in my body seems to have mounted to my head; and I
      verily believe that since so good an opportunity presents itself, I shall
      blow your brains out on the spot. So, Monsieur de Wardes, recommend
      yourself to Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Manicamp, you cannot think of such a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I am thinking of it very strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you assassinate me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without the slightest remorse, at least for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given a great many proofs of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me defend my life, then, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; in order, I suppose, that you may do to me what you have
      done to poor De Guiche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Manicamp slowly raised his pistol to the height of De Wardes&rsquo;s breast,
      and with arm stretched out, and a fixed, determined look on his face, took
      a careful aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes did not attempt a flight; he was completely terrified. In the
      midst, however, of this horrible silence, which lasted about a second, but
      which seemed an age to De Wardes, a faint sigh was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed De Wardes, &ldquo;he still lives! Help, De Guiche, I am about to
      be assassinated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp fell back a step or two, and the two young men saw the comte
      raise himself slowly and painfully upon one hand. Manicamp threw the
      pistol away a dozen paces, and ran to his friend, uttering a cry of
      delight. De Wardes wiped his forehead, which was covered with a cold
      perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just in time,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you hurt?&rdquo; inquired Manicamp of De Guiche, &ldquo;and whereabouts are
      you wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche showed him his mutilated hand and his chest covered with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comte,&rdquo; exclaimed De Wardes, &ldquo;I am accused of having assassinated you;
      speak, I implore you, and say that I fought loyally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so,&rdquo; said the wounded man; &ldquo;Monsieur de Wardes fought quite
      loyally, and whoever says the contrary will make an enemy of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said Manicamp, &ldquo;assist me, in the first place, to carry this
      gentleman home, and I will afterwards give you every satisfaction you
      please; or, if you are in a hurry, we can do better still; let us stanch
      the blood from the comte&rsquo;s wounds here, with your pocket-handkerchief and
      mine, and then, as there are two shots left, we can have them between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said De Wardes. &ldquo;Twice already, in one hour, I have seen
      death too close at hand to be agreeable; I don&rsquo;t like his look at all, and
      I prefer your apologies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp burst out laughing, and Guiche, too, in spite of his sufferings.
      The two young men wished to carry him, but he declared he felt quite
      strong enough to walk alone. The ball had broken his ring-finger and his
      little finger, and then had glanced along his side, but without
      penetrating deeply into his chest. It was the pain rather than the
      seriousness of the wound, therefore, which had overcome De Guiche.
      Manicamp passed his arm under one of the count&rsquo;s shoulders, and De Wardes
      did the same with the other, and in this way they brought him back to
      Fontainebleau, to the house of the same doctor who had been present at the
      death of the Franciscan, Aramis&rsquo;s predecessor.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIV. The King&rsquo;s Supper.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king, while these matters were being arranged, was sitting at the
      supper-table, and the not very large number of guests for that day had
      taken their seats too, after the usual gesture intimating the royal
      permission. At this period of Louis XIV.&lsquo;s reign, although etiquette was
      not governed by the strict regulations subsequently adopted, the French
      court had entirely thrown aside the traditions of good-fellowship and
      patriarchal affability existing in the time of Henry IV., which the
      suspicious mind of Louis XIII. had gradually replaced with pompous state
      and ceremony, which he despaired of being able fully to realize.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, therefore, was seated alone at a small separate table, which,
      like the desk of a president, overlooked the adjoining tables. Although we
      say a small table, we must not omit to add that this small table was the
      largest one there. Moreover, it was the one on which were placed the
      greatest number and quantity of dishes, consisting of fish, game, meat,
      fruit, vegetables, and preserves. The king was young and full of vigor and
      energy, very fond of hunting, addicted to all violent exercises of the
      body, possessing, besides, like all the members of the Bourbon family, a
      rapid digestion and an appetite speedily renewed. Louis XIV. was a
      formidable table-companion; he delighted in criticising his cooks; but
      when he honored them by praise and commendation, the honor was
      overwhelming. The king began by eating several kinds of soup, either mixed
      together or taken separately. He intermixed, or rather separated, each of
      the soups by a glass of old wine. He ate quickly and somewhat greedily.
      Porthos, who from the beginning had, out of respect, been waiting for a
      jog of D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s arm, seeing the king make such rapid progress, turned
      to the musketeer and said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems as if one might go on now; his majesty is very encouraging, from
      the example he sets. Look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king eats,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;but he talks at the same time; try and
      manage matters in such a manner that, if he should happen to address a
      remark to you, he will not find you with your mouth full&mdash;which would
      be very disrespectful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best way, in that case,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;is to eat no supper at all;
      and yet I am very hungry, I admit, and everything looks and smells most
      invitingly, as if appealing to all my senses at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of not eating for a moment,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;that would put
      his majesty out terribly. The king has a saying, &lsquo;that he who works well,
      eats well,&rsquo; and he does not like people to eat indifferently at his
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I avoid having my mouth full if I eat?&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you have to do,&rdquo; replied the captain of the musketeers, &ldquo;is simply to
      swallow what you have in it, whenever the king does you the honor to
      address a remark to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Porthos; and from that moment he began to eat with a
      certain well-bred enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king occasionally looked at the different persons who were at table
      with him, and, <i>en connoisseur</i>, could appreciate the different
      dispositions of his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur du Vallon!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos was enjoying a <i>salmi de lievre</i>, and swallowed half of the
      back. His name, pronounced in such a manner, made him start, and by a
      vigorous effort of his gullet he absorbed the whole mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Porthos, in a stifled voice, but sufficiently
      intelligible, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let those <i>filets d&rsquo;agneau</i> be handed to Monsieur du Vallon,&rdquo; said
      the king; &ldquo;do you like brown meats, M. du Vallon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I like everything,&rdquo; replied Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan whispered: &ldquo;Everything your majesty sends me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos repeated: &ldquo;Everything your majesty sends me,&rdquo; an observation which
      the king apparently received with great satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People eat well who work well,&rdquo; replied the king, delighted to have <i>en
      tete-a-tete</i> a guest who could eat as Porthos did. Porthos received the
      dish of lamb, and put a portion of it on his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exquisite,&rdquo; said Porthos, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you as good mutton in your part of the country, Monsieur du Vallon?&rdquo;
       continued the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I believe that from my own province, as everywhere else, the best
      of everything is sent to Paris for your majesty&rsquo;s use; but, on the other
      hand, I do not eat lamb in the same way your majesty does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah! and how do you eat it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Generally, I have a lamb dressed whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Whole?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what manner, Monsieur du Vallon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this, sire: my cook, who is a German, first stuffs the lamb in
      question with small sausages he procures from Strasburg, force-meat balls
      from Troyes, and larks from Pithiviers; by some means or other, which I am
      not acquainted with, he bones the lamb as he would do a fowl, leaving the
      skin on, however, which forms a brown crust all over the animal; when it
      is cut in beautiful slices, in the same way as an enormous sausage, a
      rose-colored gravy pours forth, which is as agreeable to the eye as it is
      exquisite to the palate.&rdquo; And Porthos finished by smacking his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king opened his eyes with delight, and, while cutting some of the <i>faisan
      en daube</i>, which was being handed to him, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a dish I should very much like to taste, Monsieur du Vallon. Is
      it possible! a whole lamb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely an entire lamb, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass those pheasants to M. du Vallon; I perceive he is an amateur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The order was immediately obeyed. Then, continuing the conversation, he
      said: &ldquo;And you do not find the lamb too fat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire, the fat falls down at the same time as the gravy does, and
      swims on the surface; then the servant who carves removes the fat with a
      spoon, which I have had expressly made for that purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you reside?&rdquo; inquired the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Pierrefonds, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Pierrefonds; where is that, M. du Vallon&mdash;near Belle-Isle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sire! Pierrefonds is in the Soissonnais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you alluded to the lamb on account of the salt marshes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire, I have marshes which are not salt, it is true, but which are
      not the less valuable on that account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king had now arrived at the <i>entrements</i>, but without losing
      sight of Porthos, who continued to play his part in the best manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an excellent appetite, M. du Vallon,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and you
      make an admirable guest at table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! sire, if your majesty were ever to pay a visit to Pierrefonds, we
      would both of us eat our lamb together; for your appetite is not an
      indifferent one by any means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan gave Porthos a kick under the table, which made Porthos color
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your majesty&rsquo;s present happy age,&rdquo; said Porthos, in order to repair
      the mistake he had made, &ldquo;I was in the musketeers, and nothing could ever
      satisfy me then. Your majesty has an excellent appetite, as I have already
      had the honor of mentioning, but you select what you eat with quite too
      much refinement to be called for one moment a great eater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king seemed charmed at his guest&rsquo;s politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you try some of these creams?&rdquo; he said to Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, you majesty treats me with far too much kindness to prevent me
      speaking the whole truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do so, M. du Vallon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will, sire, with regard to sweet dishes I only recognize pastry, and even
      that should be rather solid; all these frothy substances swell the
      stomach, and occupy a space which seems to me to be too precious to be so
      badly tenanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! gentlemen,&rdquo; said the king, indicating Porthos by a gesture, &ldquo;here is
      indeed a model of gastronomy. It was in such a manner that our fathers,
      who so well knew what good living was, used to <i>eat</i>, while we,&rdquo;
       added his majesty, &ldquo;do nothing but tantalize with our stomachs.&rdquo; And as he
      spoke, he took the breast of a chicken with ham, while Porthos attacked a
      dish of partridges and quails. The cup-bearer filled his majesty&rsquo;s glass.
      &ldquo;Give M. du Vallon some of my wine,&rdquo; said the king. This was one of the
      greatest honors of the royal table. D&rsquo;Artagnan pressed his friend&rsquo;s knee.
      &ldquo;If you could only manage to swallow the half of that boar&rsquo;s head I see
      yonder,&rdquo; said he to Porthos, &ldquo;I shall believe you will be a duke and peer
      within the next twelvemonth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; said Porthos, phlegmatically; &ldquo;I shall come to that by and
      by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact it was not long before it came to the boar&rsquo;s turn, for the king
      seemed to take pleasure in urging on his guest; he did not pass any of the
      dishes to Porthos until he had tasted them himself, and he accordingly
      took some of the boar&rsquo;s head. Porthos showed that he could keep pace with
      his sovereign; and, instead of eating the half, as D&rsquo;Artagnan had told
      him, he ate three-fourths of it. &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; said the king in an
      undertone, &ldquo;that a gentleman who eats so good a supper every day, and who
      has such beautiful teeth, can be otherwise than the most straightforward,
      upright man in my kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan in his friend&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I think I am rather in favor,&rdquo; said Porthos, balancing himself on
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are in luck&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king and Porthos continued to eat in the same manner, to the great
      satisfaction of the other guests, some of whom, from emulation, had
      attempted to follow them, but were obliged to give up half-way. The king
      soon began to get flushed and the reaction of the blood to his face
      announced that the moment of repletion had arrived. It was then that Louis
      XIV., instead of becoming gay and cheerful, as most good livers generally
      do, became dull, melancholy, and taciturn. Porthos, on the contrary, was
      lively and communicative. D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s foot had more than once to remind
      him of this peculiarity of the king. The dessert now made its appearance.
      The king had ceased to think anything further of Porthos; he turned his
      eyes anxiously towards the entrance-door, and he was heard occasionally to
      inquire how it happened that Monsieur de Saint-Aignan was so long in
      arriving. At last, at the moment when his majesty was finishing a pot of
      preserved plums with a deep sigh, Saint-Aignan appeared. The king&rsquo;s eyes,
      which had become somewhat dull, immediately began to sparkle. The comte
      advanced towards the king&rsquo;s table, and Louis rose at his approach.
      Everybody got up at the same time, including Porthos, who was just
      finishing an almond-cake capable of making the jaws of a crocodile stick
      together. The supper was over.

    <h2>
      Chapter XV. After Supper.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king took Saint-Aignan by the arm, and passed into the adjoining
      apartment. &ldquo;What has detained you, comte?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was bringing the answer, sire,&rdquo; replied the comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has taken a long time to reply to what I wrote her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, your majesty deigned to write in verse, and Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere wished to repay your majesty in the same coin; that is to say, in
      gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verses! Saint-Aignan,&rdquo; exclaimed the king in ecstasy. &ldquo;Give them to me at
      once.&rdquo; And Louis broke the seal of a little letter, inclosing the verses
      which history has preserved entire for us, and which are more meritorious
      in invention than in execution. Such as they were, however, the king was
      enchanted with them, and exhibited his satisfaction by unequivocal
      transports of delight; but the universal silence which reigned in the
      rooms warned Louis, so sensitively particular with regard to good
      breeding, that his delight must give rise to various interpretations. He
      turned aside and put the note in his pocket, and then advancing a few
      steps, which brought him again to the threshold of the door close to his
      guests, he said, &ldquo;M. du Vallon, I have seen you to-day with the greatest
      pleasure, and my pleasure will be equally great to see you again.&rdquo; Porthos
      bowed as the Colossus of Rhodes would have done, and retired from the room
      with his face towards the king. &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;you
      will await my orders in the gallery; I am obliged to you for having made
      me acquainted with M. du Vallon. Gentlemen,&rdquo; addressing himself to the
      other guests, &ldquo;I return to Paris to-morrow on account of the departure of
      the Spanish and Dutch ambassadors. Until to-morrow then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apartment was immediately cleared of the guests. The king took
      Saint-Aignan by the arm, made him read La Valliere&rsquo;s verses over again,
      and said, &ldquo;What do you think of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They charm me, in fact, and if they were known&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the professional poets would be jealous of them; but it is not likely
      they will know anything about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give her mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, she positively devoured them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were very weak, I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not what Mademoiselle de la Valliere said of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she was pleased with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must answer, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, immediately after supper? Your majesty will fatigue yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right; study after eating is notoriously injurious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The labor of a poet especially so; and besides, there is great excitement
      prevailing at Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With her as with all the ladies of the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On account of poor De Guiche&rsquo;s accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything serious happened to De Guiche, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, he has one hand nearly destroyed, a hole in his breast; in
      fact, he is dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manicamp brought him back just now to the house of a doctor here in
      Fontainebleau, and the rumor soon reached us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought back! Poor De Guiche; and how did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is the very question,&mdash;how did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that in a very singular manner, Saint-Aignan. Give me the
      details. What does he say himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says nothing, sire; but others do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who brought him back, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, sire; but M. de Manicamp knows. M. de Manicamp is one of
      his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As everybody is, indeed,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no!&rdquo; returned Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;you are mistaken sire; every one is not
      precisely a friend of M. de Guiche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your majesty require me to explain myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sire, I believe I have heard something said about a quarrel between
      two gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very evening, before your majesty&rsquo;s supper was served.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can hardly be. I have issued such stringent and severe ordinances
      with respect to duelling, that no one, I presume, would dare to disobey
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, Heaven preserve me from excusing any one!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Saint-Aignan. &ldquo;Your majesty commanded me to speak, and I spoke
      accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, then, in what way the Comte de Guiche has been wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is said to have been at a boar-hunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of his hands shattered, and a hole in his breast. Who was at the hunt
      with M. de Guiche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, sire; but M. de Manicamp knows, or ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are concealing something from me, Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sire, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, explain to me how the accident happened; was it a musket that
      burst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, sire. But yet, on reflection, it could hardly have been
      that, for De Guiche&rsquo;s pistol was found close by him still loaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His pistol? But a man does not go to a boar-hunt with a pistol, I should
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is also said that De Guiche&rsquo;s horse was killed and that the
      horse is still to be found in the wide open glade in the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His horse?&mdash;Guiche go on horseback to a boar-hunt?&mdash;Saint-Aignan,
      I do not understand a syllable of what you have been telling me. Where did
      this affair happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Rond-point, in that part of the forest called the Bois-Rochin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do. Call M. d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo; Saint-Aignan obeyed, and the musketeer
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you will leave this place by the
      little door of the private staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will mount your horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will proceed to the Rond-point du Bois-Rochin. Do you know the
      spot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire. I have fought there twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, amazed at the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the edicts, sire, of Cardinal Richelieu,&rdquo; returned D&rsquo;Artagnan, with
      his usual impassability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very different, monsieur. You will, therefore, go there, and will
      examine the locality very carefully. A man has been wounded there, and you
      will find a horse lying dead. You will tell me what your opinion is upon
      the whole affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of course, it is your own opinion I require, and not that of
      any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it in an hour&rsquo;s time, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prohibit your speaking with any one, whoever it may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except with the person who must give me a lantern,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is a matter of course,&rdquo; said the king, laughing at the liberty,
      which he tolerated in no one but his captain of the musketeers. D&rsquo;Artagnan
      left by the little staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let my physician be sent for,&rdquo; said Louis. Ten minutes afterwards
      the king&rsquo;s physician arrived, quite out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go, monsieur,&rdquo; said the king to him, &ldquo;and accompany M. de
      Saint-Aignan wherever he may take you; you will render me an account of
      the state of the person you may see in the house you will be taken to.&rdquo;
       The physician obeyed without a remark, as at that time people began to
      obey Louis XIV., and left the room preceding Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, Saint-Aignan, send Manicamp to me, before the physician can
      possibly have spoken to him.&rdquo; And Saint-Aignan left in his turn.

      Chapter XVI. Showing in What Way D&rsquo;Artagnan Discharged the Mission with
      Which the King Had Intrusted Him.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the king was engaged in making these last-mentioned arrangements in
      order to ascertain the truth, D&rsquo;Artagnan, without losing a second, ran to
      the stable, took down the lantern, saddled his horse himself, and
      proceeded towards the place his majesty had indicated. According to the
      promise he had made, he had not accosted any one; and, as we have
      observed, he had carried his scruples so far as to do without the
      assistance of the stable-helpers altogether. D&rsquo;Artagnan was one of those
      who in moments of difficulty pride themselves on increasing their own
      value. By dint of hard galloping, he in less than five minutes reached the
      wood, fastened his horse to the first tree he came to, and penetrated to
      the broad open space on foot. He then began to inspect most carefully, on
      foot and with his lantern in his hand, the whole surface of the
      Rond-point, went forward, turned back again, measured, examined, and after
      half an hour&rsquo;s minute inspection, he returned silently to where he had
      left his horse, and pursued his way in deep reflection and at a foot-pace
      to Fontainebleau. Louis was waiting in his cabinet; he was alone, and with
      a pencil was scribbling on paper certain lines which D&rsquo;Artagnan at the
      first glance recognized as unequal and very much touched up. The
      conclusion he arrived at was, that they must be verses. The king raised
      his head and perceived D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Well, monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you
      bring me any news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as probability goes, sire&mdash;&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan began to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was certainty I requested of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will approach it as near as I possibly can. The weather was very well
      adapted for investigations of the character I have just made; it has been
      raining this evening, and the roads were wet and muddy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the result, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, your majesty told me that there was a horse lying dead in the
      cross-road of the Bois-Rochin, and I began, therefore, by studying the
      roads. I say the roads, because the center of the cross-road is reached by
      four separate roads. The one that I myself took was the only one that
      presented any fresh traces. Two horses had followed it side by side; their
      eight feet were marked very distinctly in the clay. One of the riders was
      more impatient than the other, for the footprints of the one were
      invariably in advance of the other about half a horse&rsquo;s length.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure they were traveling together?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes sire. The horses are two rather large animals of equal pace,&mdash;horses
      well used to maneuvers of all kinds, for they wheeled round the barrier of
      the Rond-point together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;and after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two cavaliers paused there for a minute, no doubt to arrange the
      conditions of the engagement; the horses grew restless and impatient. One
      of the riders spoke, while the other listened and seemed to have contented
      himself by simply answering. His horse pawed the ground, which proves that
      his attention was so taken up by listening that he let the bridle fall
      from his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hostile meeting did take place then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Continue; you are a very accurate observer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the two cavaliers remained where he was standing, the one, in
      fact, who had been listening; the other crossed the open space, and at
      first placed himself directly opposite to his adversary. The one who had
      remained stationary traversed the Rond-point at a gallop, about two-thirds
      of its length, thinking that by this means he would gain upon his
      opponent; but the latter had followed the circumference of the wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ignorant of their names, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Completely so, sire. Only he who followed the circumference of the wood
      was mounted on a black horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found a few hairs of his tail among the brambles which bordered the
      sides of the ditch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the other horse, there can be no trouble in describing him, since
      he was left dead on the field of battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the cause of his death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ball which had passed through his brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the ball that of a pistol or a gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a pistol-bullet, sire. Besides, the manner in which the horse was
      wounded explained to me the tactics of the man who had killed it. He had
      followed the circumference of the wood in order to take his adversary in
      flank. Moreover, I followed his foot-tracks on the grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tracks of the black horse, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your majesty now perceives the position of the two adversaries, I
      will, for a moment, leave the cavalier who had remained stationary for the
      one who started off at a gallop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse of the cavalier who rode at full speed was killed on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cavalier had not time even to throw himself off his horse, and so
      fell with it. I observed the impression of his leg, which, with a great
      effort, he was enabled to extricate from under the horse. The spur,
      pressed down by the weight of the animal, had plowed up the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; and what did he do as soon as he rose up again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He walked straight up to his adversary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who still remained upon the verge of the forest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire. Then, having reached a favorable distance, he stopped firmly,
      for the impression of both his heels are left in the ground quite close to
      each other, fired, and missed his adversary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he did not hit him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found a hat with a ball through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, a proof, then!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insufficient, sire,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, coldly; &ldquo;it is a hat without any
      letters indicating its ownership, without arms; a red feather, as all hats
      have; the lace, even, had nothing particular in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the man with the hat through which the bullet had passed fire a
      second time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire, he had already fired twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you ascertain that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found the waddings of the pistol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what became of the bullet which did not kill the horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cut in two the feather of the hat belonging to him against whom it was
      directed, and broke a small birch at the other end of the open glade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, then, the man on the black horse was disarmed, whilst his
      adversary had still one more shot to fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, while the dismounted rider was extricating himself from his horse,
      the other was reloading his pistol. Only, he was much agitated while he
      was loading it, and his hand trembled greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half the charge fell to the ground, and he threw the ramrod aside, not
      having time to replace it in the pistol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, this is marvellous you tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only close observation, sire, and the commonest highwayman could
      tell as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole scene is before me from the manner in which you relate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, in fact, reconstructed it in my own mind, with merely a few
      alterations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;let us return to the dismounted cavalier. You
      were saying that he walked towards his adversary while the latter was
      loading his pistol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but at the very moment he himself was taking aim, the other fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;and the shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shot told terribly, sire; the dismounted cavalier fell upon his face,
      after having staggered forward three or four paces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he hit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two places; in the first place, in his right hand, and then, by the
      same bullet, in his chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could you ascertain that?&rdquo; inquired the king, full of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a very simple means; the butt end of the pistol was covered with
      blood, and the trace of the bullet could be observed, with fragments of a
      broken ring. The wounded man, in all probability, had the ring-finger and
      the little finger carried off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as the hand goes, I have nothing to say; but the chest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, there were two small pools of blood, at a distance of about two
      feet and a half from each other. At one of these pools of blood the grass
      was torn up by the clenched hand; at the other, the grass was simply
      pressed down by the weight of the body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor De Guiche!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it was M. de Guiche, then?&rdquo; said the musketeer, quietly. &ldquo;I suspected
      it, but did not venture to mention it to your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what made you suspect it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recognized the De Gramont arms upon the holsters of the dead horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think he is seriously wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very seriously, since he fell immediately, and remained a long time in
      the same place; however, he was able to walk, as he left the spot,
      supported by two friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You met him returning, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I observed the footprints of three men; the one on the right and
      the one on the left walked freely and easily, but the one in the middle
      dragged his feet as he walked; besides, he left traces of blood at every
      step he took.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, monsieur, since you saw the combat so distinctly that not a single
      detail seems to have escaped you, tell me something about De Guiche&rsquo;s
      adversary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire, I do not know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you see everything very clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, I see everything; but I do not tell all I see; and, since the
      poor devil has escaped, your majesty will permit me to say that I do not
      intend to denounce him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet he is guilty, since he has fought a duel, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not guilty in my eyes, sire,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, &ldquo;are you aware of what you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, sire; but, according to my notions, a man who fights a duel is
      a brave man; such, at least, is my own opinion; but your majesty may have
      another, it is but natural, for you are master here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, I ordered you, however&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan interrupted the king by a respectful gesture. &ldquo;You ordered me,
      sire, to gather what particulars I could, respecting a hostile meeting
      that had taken place; those particulars you have. If you order me to
      arrest M. de Guiche&rsquo;s adversary, I will do so; but do not order me to
      denounce him to you, for in that case I will not obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Arrest him, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me his name, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king stamped his foot angrily; but after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, he
      said, &ldquo;You are right&mdash;ten times, twenty times, a hundred times
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my opinion, sire: I am happy that, this time, it accords with
      your majesty&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more. Who assisted Guiche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you speak of two men. There was a person present, then, as second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no second, sire. Nay, more than that, when M. de Guiche fell,
      his adversary fled without giving him any assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The miserable coward!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The consequence of your ordinances, sire. If a man has fought well, and
      fairly, and has already escaped one chance of death, he naturally wishes
      to escape a second. M. de Bouteville cannot be forgotten very easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, men turn cowards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they become prudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has fled, then, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and as fast as his horse could possibly carry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the direction of the chateau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards, as I have had the honor of telling your majesty, two men on
      foot arrived, who carried M. de Guiche back with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof have you that these men arrived after the combat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very evident proof, sire; at the moment the encounter took place, the
      rain had just ceased, the ground had not had time to imbibe the moisture,
      and was, consequently, soaked; the footsteps sank in the ground; but while
      M. de Guiche was lying there in a fainting condition, the ground became
      firm again, and the footsteps made a less sensible impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis clapped his hands together in sign of admiration. &ldquo;Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are positively the cleverest man in my
      kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The identical thing M. de Richelieu thought, and M. de Mazarin said,
      sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, it remains for us to see if your sagacity is at fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, a man may be mistaken; <i>humanum est errare</i>,&rdquo; said the
      musketeer, philosophically. <a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1"
       id="linknoteref-1"><small>1</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, you are not human, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, for I believe you
      are never mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty said that we were going to see whether such was the case, or
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way, may I venture to ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent for M. de Manicamp, and M. de Manicamp is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. de Manicamp knows the secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Guiche has no secrets from M. de Manicamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan shook his head. &ldquo;No one was present at the combat, I repeat;
      and unless M. de Manicamp was one of the two men who brought him back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;he is coming; remain, and listen attentively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, at the very same moment, Manicamp and Saint-Aignan appeared at the
      threshold of the door.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII. The Encounter.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king signified with an imperious gesture, first to the musketeer, then
      to Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;On your lives, not a word.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Artagnan withdrew, like a
      sentinel, to a corner of the room; Saint-Aignan, in his character of a
      favorite, leaned over the back of the king&rsquo;s chair. Manicamp, with his
      right foot properly advanced, a smile upon his lips, and his white and
      well-formed hands gracefully disposed, advanced to make his reverence to
      the king, who returned the salutation by a bow. &ldquo;Good evening, M. de
      Manicamp,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty did me the honor to send for me,&rdquo; said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in order to learn from you all the details of the unfortunate
      accident which has befallen the Comte de Guiche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, it is grievous indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not precisely, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you arrived on the scene of the accident, a few minutes after it took
      place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, about half an hour afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did the accident happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, sire, the place is called the Rond-point du Bois-Rochin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the rendezvous of the hunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very spot, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; give me all the details you are acquainted with, respecting this
      unhappy affair, Monsieur de Manicamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps your majesty has already been informed of them, and I fear to
      fatigue you with useless repetition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, do not be afraid of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp looked round him; he saw only D&rsquo;Artagnan leaning with his back
      against the wainscot&mdash;D&rsquo;Artagnan, calm, kind, and good-natured as
      usual&mdash;and Saint-Aignan whom he had accompanied, and who still leaned
      over the king&rsquo;s armchair with an expression of countenance equally full of
      good feeling. He determined, therefore, to speak out. &ldquo;Your majesty is
      perfectly aware,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that accidents are very frequent in hunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In hunting, do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, sire, when an animal is brought to bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;it was when the animal was brought to bay, then,
      that the accident happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! sire, unhappily it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king paused for a moment before he said: &ldquo;What animal was being
      hunted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wild boar, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what could possibly have possessed De Guiche to go to a wild
      boar-hunt by himself; that is but a clownish idea of sport, only fit for
      that class of people who, unlike the Marechal de Gramont, have no dogs and
      huntsmen, to hunt as gentlemen should do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Youth is very rash,&rdquo; he said,
      sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; continued Manicamp, not venturing to be too precipitate
      and hasty, and letting his words fall very slowly one by one, &ldquo;at all
      events, sire, poor De Guiche went hunting&mdash;all alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite alone? indeed?&mdash;What a sportsman! And is not M. de Guiche
      aware that the wild boar always stands at bay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very thing that really happened, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had some idea, then, of the beast being there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, some peasants had seen it among their potatoes.&rdquo; <a
      href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what kind of animal was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A short, thick beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may as well tell me, monsieur, that De Guiche had some idea of
      committing suicide; for I have seen him hunt, and he is an active and
      vigorous hunter. Whenever he fires at an animal brought to bay and held in
      check by the dogs, he takes every possible precaution, and yet he fires
      with a carbine, and on this occasion he seems to have faced the boar with
      pistols only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A costly pair of pistols, excellent weapons to fight a duel with a man
      and not a wild boar. What an absurdity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some things, sire, which are difficult of explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, and the event which we are now discussing is
      certainly one of them. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the recital, Saint-Aignan, who probably would have made a sign to
      Manicamp to be careful what he was about, found that the king&rsquo;s glance was
      constantly fixed upon himself, so that it was utterly impossible to
      communicate with Manicamp in any way. As for D&rsquo;Artagnan, the statue of
      Silence at Athens was far more noisy and far more expressive than he.
      Manicamp, therefore, was obliged to continue in the same way he had begun,
      and so contrived to get more and more entangled in his explanation.
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is probably how the affair happened. Guiche was
      waiting to receive the boar as it rushed towards him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On foot or on horseback?&rdquo; inquired the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On horseback. He fired upon the brute and missed his aim, and then it
      dashed upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the horse was killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! your majesty knows that, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told that a horse has been found lying dead in the
      cross-roads of the Bois-Rochin, and I presume it was De Guiche&rsquo;s horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true, sire, it was his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so much for the horse, and now for De Guiche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Guiche, once down, was attacked and worried by the wild boar, and
      wounded in the hand and in the chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a horrible accident, but it must be admitted it was De Guiche&rsquo;s own
      fault. How could he possibly have gone to hunt such an animal merely armed
      with pistols; he must have forgotten the fable of Adonis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp rubbed his ear in seeming perplexity. &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it
      was very imprudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you explain it, Monsieur Manicamp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, what is written is written!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are a fatalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp looked very uncomfortable and ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am angry with you, Monsieur Manicamp,&rdquo; continued the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. How was it that you, who are De Guiche&rsquo;s intimate friend, and who
      know that he is subject to such acts of folly, did not stop him in time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp no longer knew what to do; the tone in which the king spoke was
      anything but that of a credulous man. On the other hand, it did not
      indicate any particular severity, nor did he seem to care very much about
      the cross-examination. There was more of raillery in it than menace. &ldquo;And
      you say, then,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;that it was positively De Guiche&rsquo;s
      horse that was found dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite positive, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did that astonish you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire; for your majesty will remember that, at the last hunt, M. de
      Saint-Maure had a horse killed under him, and in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that one was ripped open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had Guiche&rsquo;s horse been ripped open like M. de Saint-Maure&rsquo;s horse, I
      should not have been astonished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp opened his eyes very wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I mistaken,&rdquo; resumed the king, &ldquo;was it not in the frontal bone that De
      Guiche&rsquo;s horse was struck? You must admit, Monsieur de Manicamp, that that
      is a very singular place for a wild boar to attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware, sire, that the horse is a very intelligent animal, and he
      doubtless endeavoured to defend himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a horse defends himself with his heels and not with his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, the terrified horse may have slipped or fallen down,&rdquo; said
      Manicamp, &ldquo;and the boar, you understand sire, the boar&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I understand that perfectly, as far as the horse is concerned; but
      how about his rider?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! that, too, is simple enough; the boar left the horse and attacked
      the rider; and, as I have already had the honor of informing your majesty,
      shattered De Guiche&rsquo;s hand at the very moment he was about to discharge
      his second pistol at him, and then, with a gouge of his tusk, made that
      terrible hole in his chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is more likely; really, Monsieur de Manicamp, you are wrong in
      placing so little confidence in your own eloquence, and you can tell a
      story most admirably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is exceedingly kind,&rdquo; said Manicamp, saluting him in the
      most embarrassed manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From this day henceforth, I will prohibit any gentleman attached to my
      court going out to a similar encounter. Really, one might just as well
      permit duelling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp started, and moved as if he were about to withdraw. &ldquo;Is your
      majesty satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted; but do not withdraw yet, Monsieur de Manicamp,&rdquo; said Louis, &ldquo;I
      have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; thought D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;there is another who is not up to the
      mark;&rdquo; and he uttered a sigh which might signify, &ldquo;Oh! the men of <i>our</i>
      stamp, where are they <i>now?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment an usher lifted up the curtain before the door, and
      announced the king&rsquo;s physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Louis, &ldquo;here comes Monsieur Valot, who has just been to
      see M. de Guiche. We shall now hear news of the man maltreated by the
      boar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp felt more uncomfortable than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way, at least,&rdquo; added the king, &ldquo;our conscience will be quite
      clear.&rdquo; And he looked at D&rsquo;Artagnan, who did not seem in the slightest
      degree discomposed.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVIII. The Physician.
    </h2>
    <p>
      M. Valot entered. The position of the different persons present was
      precisely the same: the king was seated, Saint-Aignan leaning over the
      back of his armchair, D&rsquo;Artagnan with his back against the wall, and
      Manicamp still standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, M. Valot,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;did you obey my directions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the greatest alacrity, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went to the doctor&rsquo;s house in Fontainebleau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found M. de Guiche there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What state was he in?&mdash;speak unreservedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a very sad state indeed, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wild boar did not quite devour him, however?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devour whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Guiche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wild boar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boar that wounded him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche wounded by a boar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is said, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a poacher, rather, or by a jealous husband, or an ill-used lover, who,
      in order to be revenged, fired upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you say, Monsieur Valot? Were not M. de Guiche&rsquo;s wounds
      produced by defending himself against a wild boar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche&rsquo;s wounds are the result of a pistol-bullet that broke his
      ring-finger and the little finger of the right hand, and afterwards buried
      itself in the intercostal muscles of the chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bullet! Are you sure Monsieur de Guiche was wounded by a <i>bullet?</i>&rdquo;
       exclaimed the king, pretending to look much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I am, sire; so sure, in fact, that here it is.&rdquo; And he presented
      to the king a half-flattened bullet, which the king looked at, but did not
      touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he have that in his chest, poor fellow?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not precisely. The ball did not penetrate, but was flattened, as you see,
      either upon the trigger of the pistol or upon the right side of the
      breast-bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said the king, seriously, &ldquo;you said nothing to me about
      this, Monsieur de Manicamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does all this mean, then, this invention about hunting a wild boar
      at nightfall? Come, speak, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems, then, that you are right,&rdquo; said the king, turning round towards
      his captain of musketeers, &ldquo;and that a duel actually took place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king possessed, to a greater extent than any one else, the faculty
      enjoyed by the great in power or position, of compromising and dividing
      those beneath him. Manicamp darted a look full of reproaches at the
      musketeer. D&rsquo;Artagnan understood the look at once, and not wishing to
      remain beneath the weight of such an accusation, advanced a step forward,
      and said: &ldquo;Sire, your majesty commanded me to go and explore the place
      where the cross-roads meet in the Bois-Rochin, and to report to you,
      according to my own ideas, what had taken place there. I submitted my
      observations to you, but without denouncing any one. It was your majesty
      yourself who was the first to name the Comte de Guiche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, well,&rdquo; said the king, haughtily; &ldquo;you have done your
      duty, and I am satisfied with you. But you, Monsieur de Manicamp, have
      failed in yours, for you have told me a falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A falsehood, sire. The expression is a hard one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find a more accurate, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I will not attempt to do so. I have already been unfortunate enough
      to displease your majesty, and it will, in every respect, be far better
      for me to accept most humbly any reproaches you may think proper to
      address to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, monsieur, whoever conceals the truth from me, risks my
      displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes, sire, one is ignorant of the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No further falsehood, monsieur, or I double the punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp bowed and turned pale. D&rsquo;Artagnan again made another step
      forward, determined to interfere, if the still increasing anger of the
      king attained certain limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, monsieur,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;that it is useless to deny the
      thing any longer. M. de Guiche has fought a duel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deny it, sire, and it would have been truly generous on your
      majesty&rsquo;s part not to have forced me to tell a falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forced? Who forced you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, M. de Guiche is my friend. Your majesty has forbidden duels under
      pain of death. A falsehood might save my friend&rsquo;s life, and I told it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;an excellent fellow, upon my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of telling a falsehood, monsieur, you should have prevented him
      from fighting,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, your majesty, who is the most accomplished gentleman in France,
      knows quite as well as any of us other gentlemen that we have never
      considered M. de Bouteville dishonored for having suffered death on the
      Place de Greve. That which does in truth dishonor a man is to avoid
      meeting his enemy&mdash;not to avoid meeting his executioner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, that may be so,&rdquo; said Louis XIV.; &ldquo;I am desirous of
      suggesting a means of your repairing all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be a means of which a gentleman may avail himself, I shall most
      eagerly seize the opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name of M. de Guiche&rsquo;s adversary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;are we going to take Louis XIII. as a
      model?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; said Manicamp, with an accent of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not name him, then?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I do not know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Manicamp, hand your sword to the captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp bowed very gracefully, unbuckled his sword, smiling as he did so,
      and handed it for the musketeer to take. But Saint-Aignan advanced
      hurriedly between him and D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will your majesty
      permit me to say a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said the king, delighted, perhaps, at the bottom of his heart,
      for some one to step between him and the wrath he felt he had carried him
      too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manicamp, you are a brave man, and the king will appreciate your conduct;
      but to wish to serve your friends too well, is to destroy them. Manicamp,
      you know the name the king asks you for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly true&mdash;I do know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will give it up then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I felt I ought to have mentioned it, I should have already done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will tell it, for I am not so extremely sensitive on such points
      of honor as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are at liberty to do so, but it seems to me, however&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a truce to magnanimity; I will not permit you to go to the Bastile in
      that way. Do you speak; or I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp was keen-witted enough, and perfectly understood that he had done
      quite sufficient to produce a good opinion of his conduct; it was now only
      a question of persevering in such a manner as to regain the good graces of
      the king. &ldquo;Speak, monsieur,&rdquo; he said to Saint-Aignan; &ldquo;I have on my own
      behalf done all that my conscience told me to do; and it must have been
      very importunate,&rdquo; he added, turning towards the king, &ldquo;since its mandates
      led me to disobey your majesty&rsquo;s commands; but your majesty will forgive
      me, I hope, when you learn that I was anxious to preserve the honor of a
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a lady?&rdquo; said the king, with some uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady was the cause of this duel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the position of the lady in question warrants it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall
      not complain of your having acted with so much circumspection; on the
      contrary, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, everything which concerns your majesty&rsquo;s household, or the
      household of your majesty&rsquo;s brother, is of importance in my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my brother&rsquo;s household,&rdquo; repeated Louis XIV., with a slight
      hesitation. &ldquo;The cause of the duel was a lady belonging to my brother&rsquo;s
      household, do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to Madame&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! to Madame&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;and this lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is one of the maids of honor of her royal highness Madame la Duchesse
      d&rsquo;Orleans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom M. de Guiche fought&mdash;do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, and, this time, I tell no falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis seemed restless and anxious. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, turning towards
      the spectators of this scene, &ldquo;will you have the goodness to retire for a
      moment. I wish to be alone with M. de Manicamp; I know he has some
      important communication to make for his own justification, and which he
      will not venture before witnesses.... Put up your sword, M. de Manicamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp returned his sword to his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow decidedly has his wits about him,&rdquo; murmured the musketeer,
      taking Saint-Aignan by the arm, and withdrawing with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will get out of it,&rdquo; said the latter in D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with honor, too, comte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp cast a glance of recognition at Saint-Aignan and the captain,
      which luckily passed unnoticed by the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he left the room, &ldquo;I had an indifferent
      opinion of the new generation. Well, I was mistaken after all. There is
      some good in them, I perceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valot preceded the favorite and the captain, leaving the king and Manicamp
      alone in the cabinet.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIX. Wherein D&rsquo;Artagnan Perceives that It Was He Who Was Mistaken,
      and Manicamp Who Was Right.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king, determined to be satisfied that no one was listening, went
      himself to the door, and then returned precipitately and placed himself
      opposite Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now we are alone, Monsieur de Manicamp, explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the greatest frankness, sire,&rdquo; replied the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the first place, pray understand,&rdquo; added the king, &ldquo;that there is
      nothing to which I personally attach a greater importance than the honor
      of <i>any</i> lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very reason, sire, why I endeavored to study your delicacy of
      sentiment and feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand it all now. You say that it was one of the maids of
      honor of my sister-in-law who was the subject of dispute, and that the
      person in question, De Guiche&rsquo;s adversary, the man, in point of fact, whom
      you will not name&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whom M. de Saint-Aignan will name, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you say, however, that this man insulted some one belonging to the
      household of Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire. Mademoiselle de la Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the king, as if he had expected the name, and yet as if its
      announcement had caused him a sudden pang; &ldquo;ah! it was Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere who was insulted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say precisely that she was insulted, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at all events&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely say that she was spoken of in terms far enough from respectful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man dares to speak in disrespectful terms of Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere, and yet you refuse to tell me the name of the insulter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I thought it was quite understood that your majesty had abandoned
      the idea of making me denounce him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true, monsieur,&rdquo; returned the king, controlling his anger;
      &ldquo;besides, I shall know in good time the name of this man whom I shall feel
      it my duty to punish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp perceived that they had returned to the question again. As for
      the king, he saw he had allowed himself to be hurried away a little too
      far, and therefore continued:&mdash;&ldquo;And I will punish him&mdash;not
      because there is any question of Mademoiselle de la Valliere, although I
      esteem her very highly&mdash;but because a lady was the object of the
      quarrel. And I intend that ladies shall be respected at my court, and that
      quarrels shall be put a stop to altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Monsieur de Manicamp,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;what was said about
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot your majesty guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty can imagine the character of the jest in which young men
      permit themselves to indulge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They very probably said that she was in love with some one?&rdquo; the king
      ventured to remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mademoiselle de la Valliere has a perfect right to love any one she
      pleases,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very point De Guiche maintained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on account of which he fought, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, the sole and only cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king colored. &ldquo;And you do not know anything more, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what respect, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the very interesting respect which you are now referring to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your majesty wish to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the name of the man with whom La Valliere is in love, and whom De
      Guiche&rsquo;s adversary disputed her right to love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I know nothing&mdash;I have heard nothing&mdash;and have learnt
      nothing, even accidentally; but De Guiche is a noble-hearted fellow, and
      if, momentarily, he substituted himself in the place or stead of La
      Valliere&rsquo;s protector, it was because that protector was himself of too
      exalted a position to undertake her defense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were more than transparent; they made the king blush, but this
      time with pleasure. He struck Manicamp gently on the shoulder. &ldquo;Well,
      well, Monsieur de Manicamp, you are not only a ready, witty fellow, but a
      brave gentleman besides, and your friend De Guiche is a paladin quite
      after my own heart; you will express that to him from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty forgives me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled and held out his hand to Manicamp, which he took and
      kissed respectfully. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; added the king, &ldquo;you relate stories so
      charmingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me in the most admirable manner the particulars of the accident
      which happened to Guiche. I can see the wild boar rushing out of the wood&mdash;I
      can see the horse fall down fighting with his head, and the boar rush from
      the horse to the rider. You do not simply relate a story well: you
      positively paint its incidents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I think your majesty condescends to laugh at my expense,&rdquo; said
      Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Louis, seriously, &ldquo;I have so little intention of
      laughing, Monsieur de Manicamp, that I wish you to relate this adventure
      to every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The adventure of the hunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in the same manner you told it to me, without changing a single word&mdash;<i>you
      understand?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will relate it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without losing a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! and now summon M. d&rsquo;Artagnan; I hope you are no longer afraid
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire, from the very moment I am sure of your majesty&rsquo;s kind
      disposition, I no longer fear anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him, then,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp opened the door, and said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, the king wishes you to
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, Saint-Aignan, and Valot entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I summoned you for the purposes of saying
      that Monsieur de Manicamp&rsquo;s explanation has entirely satisfied me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan glanced at Valot and Saint-Aignan, as much as to say, &ldquo;Well!
      did I not tell you so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king led Manicamp to the door, and then in a low tone of voice said:
      &ldquo;See that M. de Guiche takes good care of himself, and particularly that
      he recovers as soon as possible; I am very desirous of thanking him in the
      name of every lady, but let him take special care that he does not begin
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were he to die a hundred times, sire, he would begin again if your
      majesty&rsquo;s honor were in any way called in question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark was direct enough. But we have already said that the incense
      of flattery was very pleasing to the king, and, provided he received it,
      he was not very particular as to its quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, very well,&rdquo; he said, as he dismissed Manicamp, &ldquo;I will see De
      Guiche myself, and make him listen to reason.&rdquo; And as Manicamp left the
      apartment, the king turned round towards the three spectators of this
      scene, and said, &ldquo;Tell me, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, how does it happen that
      your sight is so imperfect?&mdash;you, whose eyes are generally so very
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sight bad, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be the case since your majesty says so; but in what respect, may
      I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, with regard to what occurred in the Bois-Rochin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You pretended to have seen the tracks of two horses, to have
      detected the footprints of two men; and have described the particulars of
      an engagement, which you assert took place. Nothing of the sort occurred;
      pure illusion on your part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly the same thing with the galloping to and fro of the horses, and
      the other indications of a struggle. It was the struggle of De Guiche
      against the wild boar, and absolutely nothing else; only the struggle was
      a long and a terrible one, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I think that I almost believed it for a moment&mdash;but, then,
      you told it with such confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit, sire, that I must have been very short-sighted,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a readiness of humor which delighted the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do admit it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit it, sire, most assuredly I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So now that you see the thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In quite a different light from that in which I saw it half an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to what, then, do you attribute this difference in your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a very simple thing, sire; half an hour ago I returned from
      Bois-Rochin, where I had nothing to light me but a stupid stable lantern&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While now I have all the wax-lights of your cabinet, and more than that,
      your majesty&rsquo;s own eyes, which illuminate everything, like the blazing sun
      at noonday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king began to laugh; and Saint-Aignan broke out into convulsions of
      merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is precisely like M. Valot,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, resuming the
      conversation where the king had left off; &ldquo;he has been imagining all
      along, that not only was M. de Guiche wounded by a bullet, but still more,
      that he extracted it, even, from his chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Valot, &ldquo;I assure you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, did you not believe that?&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Valot; &ldquo;not only did I believe it, but, at this very moment, I
      would swear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear doctor, you have dreamt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have dreamt it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche&rsquo;s wound&mdash;a mere dream; the bullet, a dream. So, take my
      advice, and prate no more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; returned the king, &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s advice is sound. Do not
      speak of your dream to any one, Monsieur Valot, and, upon the word of a
      gentleman, you will have no occasion to repent it. Good evening,
      gentlemen; a very sad affair, indeed, is a wild boar-hunt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very serious thing, indeed,&rdquo; repeated D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a loud voice, &ldquo;is
      a wild boar-hunt!&rdquo; and he repeated it in every room through which he
      passed; and left the chateau, taking Valot with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now we are alone,&rdquo; said the king to Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;what is the name
      of De Guiche&rsquo;s adversary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan looked at the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not hesitate,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;you know that I am bound beforehand
      to forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Wardes,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Louis XIV.; and then, retiring to his own room, added to
      himself, &ldquo;To forgive is not to forget.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XX. Showing the Advantage of Having Two Strings to One&rsquo;s Bow.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Manicamp quitted the king&rsquo;s apartment, delighted at having succeeded so
      well, when, just as he reached the bottom of the staircase and was passing
      a doorway, he felt that some one suddenly pulled him by the sleeve. He
      turned round and recognized Montalais, who was waiting for him in the
      passage, and who, in a very mysterious manner, with her body bent forward,
      and in a low tone of voice, said to him, &ldquo;Follow me, monsieur, and without
      any delay, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to, mademoiselle?&rdquo; inquired Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, a true knight would not have asked such a question,
      but would have followed me without requiring any explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mademoiselle, I am quite ready to conduct myself as a true knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is too late, and you cannot take the credit of it. We are going to
      Madame&rsquo;s apartment, so come at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; said Manicamp. &ldquo;Lead on, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he followed Montalais, who ran before him as light as Galatea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time,&rdquo; said Manicamp, as he followed his guide, &ldquo;I do not think that
      stories about hunting expeditions would be acceptable. We will try,
      however, and if need be&mdash;well, if there should be any occasion for
      it, we must try something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais still ran on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fatiguing it is,&rdquo; thought Manicamp, &ldquo;to have need of one&rsquo;s head and
      legs at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, they arrived. Madame had just finished undressing, and
      was in a most elegant <i>deshabille</i>, but it must be understood that
      she had changed her dress before she had any idea of being subjected to
      the emotions now agitating her. She was waiting with the most restless
      impatience; and Montalais and Manicamp found her standing near the door.
      At the sound of their approaching footsteps, Madame came forward to meet
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is M. Manicamp,&rdquo; replied Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp bowed with the greatest respect; Madame signed to Montalais to
      withdraw, and she immediately obeyed. Madame followed her with her eyes,
      in silence, until the door closed behind her, and then, turning towards
      Manicamp, said, &ldquo;What is the matter?&mdash;and is it true, as I am told,
      Monsieur de Manicamp, that some one is lying wounded in the chateau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame, unfortunately so&mdash;Monsieur de Guiche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur de Guiche,&rdquo; repeated the princess. &ldquo;I had, in fact, heard
      it rumored, but not confirmed. And so, in truth, it is Monsieur de Guiche
      who has been thus unfortunate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche himself, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware, M. de Manicamp,&rdquo; said the princess, hastily, &ldquo;that the
      king has the strongest antipathy to duels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so, Madame; but a duel with a wild beast is not answerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you will not insult me by supposing that I credit the absurd fable,
      with what object I cannot tell, respecting M. de Guiche having been
      wounded by a wild boar. No, no, monsieur; the real truth is known, and, in
      addition to the inconvenience of his wound, M. de Guiche runs the risk of
      losing his liberty if not his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Madame, I am well aware of that, but what is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him how M. de Guiche went to the chase, and how a wild boar rushed
      forth out of the Bois-Rochin; how M. de Guiche fired at it, and how, in
      fact, the furious brute dashed at De Guiche, killed his horse, and
      grievously wounded himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king believed that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Implicitly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you surprise me, Monsieur de Manicamp; you surprise me very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Madame walked up and down the room, casting a searching look from time
      to time at Manicamp, who remained motionless and impassible in the same
      place. At last she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;every one here seems unanimous in giving another
      cause for this wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cause, Madame?&rdquo; said Manicamp; &ldquo;may I be permitted, without
      indiscretion, to ask your highness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask such a question! You, M. de Guiche&rsquo;s intimate friend, his
      confidant, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Madame! his intimate friend&mdash;yes; confidant&mdash;no. De Guiche
      is a man who can keep his own secrets, who has some of his own certainly,
      but who never breathes a syllable about them. De Guiche is discretion
      itself, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; those secrets which M. de Guiche keeps so scrupulously,
      I shall have the pleasure of informing you of,&rdquo; said the princess, almost
      spitefully; &ldquo;for the king may possibly question you a second time, and if,
      on the second occasion, you were to repeat the same story to him, he
      possibly might not be very well satisfied with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Madame, I think your highness is mistaken with regard to the king.
      His majesty was perfectly satisfied with me, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, permit me to assure you, Monsieur de Manicamp, it only
      proves one thing, which is, that his majesty is very easily satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your highness is mistaken in arriving at such an opinion; his
      majesty is well known not to be contented except with very good reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you suppose that he will thank you for your officious falsehood,
      when he will learn to-morrow that M. de Guiche had, on behalf of his
      friend M. de Bragelonne, a quarrel which ended in a hostile meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarrel on M. de Bragelonne&rsquo;s account,&rdquo; said Manicamp, with the most
      innocent expression in the world; &ldquo;what does your royal highness do me the
      honor to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there astonishing in that? M. de Guiche is susceptible,
      irritable, and easily loses his temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Madame, I know M. de Guiche to be very patient, and
      never susceptible or irritable except upon very good grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is not friendship a just ground?&rdquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, Madame; and particularly for a heart like his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; you will not deny, I suppose, that M. de Bragelonne is M. de
      Guiche&rsquo;s good friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, M. de Guiche has taken M. de Bragelonne&rsquo;s part; and as M. de
      Bragelonne was absent and could not fight, he fought for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp began to smile, and moved his head and shoulders very slightly,
      as much as to say, &ldquo;Oh, if you will positively have it so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But speak, at all events,&rdquo; said the princess, out of patience; &ldquo;speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; it is quite clear you are not of my opinion, and that you have
      something to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one thing to say, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I do not understand a single word of what you have just been telling
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&mdash;you do not understand a single word about M. de Guiche&rsquo;s
      quarrel with M. de Wardes,&rdquo; exclaimed the princess, almost out of temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarrel,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;which arose out of a conversation scandalous
      in its tone and purport, and more or less well founded, respecting the
      virtue of a certain lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! of a certain lady,&mdash;this is quite another thing,&rdquo; said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You begin to understand, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your highness will excuse me, but I dare not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare not,&rdquo; said Madame, exasperated; &ldquo;very well, then, wait one
      moment, I will dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, Madame!&rdquo; exclaimed Manicamp, as if in great dismay, &ldquo;be careful
      of what you are going to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem, monsieur, that, if I happened to be a man, you would
      challenge me, notwithstanding his majesty&rsquo;s edicts, as Monsieur de Guiche
      challenged M. de Wardes; and that, too, on account of the virtue of
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Mademoiselle de la Valliere!&rdquo; exclaimed Manicamp, starting backwards,
      as if that was the very last name he expected to hear pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you start in that manner, Monsieur de Manicamp?&rdquo; said Madame,
      ironically; &ldquo;do you mean to say you would be impertinent enough to suspect
      that young lady&rsquo;s honor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, in the whole course of this affair there has not been the
      slightest question of Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! when two men have almost blown each other&rsquo;s brains out on a woman&rsquo;s
      behalf, do you mean to say she has had nothing to do with the affair, and
      that her name has not been called in question at all? I did not think you
      so good a courtier, Monsieur de Manicamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray forgive me, Madame,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;but we are very far from
      understanding one another. You do me the honor to speak one language while
      I am speaking altogether another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but I do not understand your meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, then; but I fancied I understood your highness to remark that
      De Guiche and De Wardes had fought on Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s
      account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On account of Mademoiselle de la Valliere, I think you said?&rdquo; repeated
      Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say that M. de Guiche personally took an interest in
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere, but I say that he did so as representing or
      acting on behalf of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On behalf of another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, do not always assume such a bewildered look. Does not every one
      here know that M. de Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere, and that before he went on the mission with which the king
      intrusted him, he charged his friend M. de Guiche to watch over that
      interesting young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing more for me to say, then. Your highness is
      well-informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of everything. I beg you to understand that clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp began to laugh, which almost exasperated the princess, who was
      not, as we know, of a very patient disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; resumed the discreet Manicamp, saluting the princess, &ldquo;let us
      bury this affair altogether in forgetfulness, for it will probably never
      be quite cleared up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as far as that goes there is nothing more to do, and the information
      is complete. The king will learn that M. de Guiche has taken up the cause
      of this little adventuress, who gives herself all the airs of a grand
      lady; he will learn that Monsieur de Bragelonne, having nominated his
      friend M. de Guiche his guardian-in-ordinary, the latter immediately
      fastened, as he was required to do, upon the Marquis de Wardes, who
      ventured to trench upon his privileges. Moreover, you cannot pretend to
      deny, Monsieur Manicamp&mdash;you who know everything so well&mdash;that
      the king on his side casts a longing eye upon this famous treasure, and
      that he will bear no slight grudge against M. de Guiche for constituting
      himself its defender. Are you sufficiently well informed now, or do you
      require anything further? If so, speak, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madame, there is nothing more I wish to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Learn, however&mdash;for you ought to know it, Monsieur de Manicamp&mdash;learn
      that his majesty&rsquo;s indignation will be followed by terrible consequences.
      In princes of a similar temperament to that of his majesty, the passion
      which jealousy causes sweeps down like a whirlwind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you will temper, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed the princess, with a gesture of indescribable irony; &ldquo;I!
      and by what title, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you detest injustice, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And according to your account, then, it would be an injustice to prevent
      the king arranging his love affairs as he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will intercede, however, in M. de Guiche&rsquo;s favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad, monsieur,&rdquo; said the princess, in a haughty tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I am in the most perfect possession of my senses; and I
      repeat, you will defend M. de Guiche before the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the cause of M. de Guiche is your own, Madame,&rdquo; said Manicamp,
      with ardor kindling in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, Madame, that, with respect to the defense which Monsieur de
      Guiche undertook in M. de Bragelonne&rsquo;s absence, I am surprised that your
      highness has not detected a pretext in La Valliere&rsquo;s name having been
      brought forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretext? But a pretext for what?&rdquo; repeated the princess, hesitatingly,
      for Manicamp&rsquo;s steady look had just revealed something of the truth to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, Madame,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I have said sufficient to induce
      your highness not to overwhelm before his majesty my poor friend, De
      Guiche, against whom all the malevolence of a party bitterly opposed to
      your own will now be directed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, on the contrary, I suppose, that all those who have no great
      affection for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and even, perhaps, a few of
      those who have some regard for her, will be angry with the comte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Madame! why will you push your obstinacy to such an extent, and
      refuse to open your ears and listen to the counsel of one whose devotion
      to you is unbounded? Must I expose myself to the risk of your displeasure,&mdash;am
      I really to be called upon to name, contrary to my own wish, the person
      who was the real cause of this quarrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person?&rdquo; said Madame, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I,&rdquo; continued Manicamp, &ldquo;tell you how poor De Guiche became
      irritated, furious, exasperated beyond all control, at the different
      rumors now being circulated about this person? Must I, if you persist in
      this willful blindness, and if respect should continue to prevent me
      naming her,&mdash;must I, I repeat, recall to your recollection the
      various scenes which Monsieur had with the Duke of Buckingham, and the
      insinuations which were reported respecting the duke&rsquo;s exile? Must I
      remind you of the anxious care the comte always took in his efforts to
      please, to watch, to protect that person for whom alone he lives,&mdash;for
      whom alone he breathes? Well! I will do so; and when I shall have made you
      recall all the particulars I refer to, you will perhaps understand how it
      happened that the comte, having lost all control over himself, and having
      been for some time past almost harassed to death by De Wardes, became, at
      the first disrespectful expression which the latter pronounced respecting
      the person in question, inflamed with passion, and panted only for an
      opportunity of avenging the affront.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess concealed her face with her hands. &ldquo;Monsieur, monsieur!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed; &ldquo;do you know what you are saying, and to whom you are
      speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, Madame,&rdquo; pursued Manicamp, as if he had not heard the
      exclamations of the princess, &ldquo;nothing will astonish you any longer,&mdash;neither
      the comte&rsquo;s ardor in seeking the quarrel, nor his wonderful address in
      transferring it to a quarter foreign to your own personal interests. That
      latter circumstance was, indeed, a marvelous instance of tact and perfect
      coolness, and if the person in whose behalf the comte so fought and shed
      his blood does, in reality, owe some gratitude to the poor wounded
      sufferer, it is not on account of the blood he has shed, or the agony he
      has suffered, but for the steps he has taken to preserve from comment or
      reflection an honor which is more precious to him than his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Madame, as if she had been alone, &ldquo;is it possible the quarrel
      was on my account!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp felt he could now breathe for a moment&mdash;and gallantly had he
      won the right to do so. Madame, on her side, remained for some time
      plunged in a painful reverie. Her agitation could be seen by her quick
      respiration, by her drooping eyelids, by the frequency with which she
      pressed her hand upon her heart. But, in her, coquetry was not so much a
      passive quality, as, on the contrary, a fire which sought for fuel to
      maintain itself, finding anywhere and everywhere what it required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be as you assert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the comte will have obliged two
      persons at the same time; for Monsieur de Bragelonne also owes a deep debt
      of gratitude to M. de Guiche&mdash;and with far greater reason, indeed,
      because everywhere, and on every occasion, Mademoiselle de la Valliere
      will be regarded as having been defended by this generous champion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp perceived that there still remained some lingering doubt in the
      princess&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;A truly admirable service, indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the
      one he has rendered to Mademoiselle de la Valliere! A truly admirable
      service to M. de Bragelonne! The duel has created a sensation which, in
      some respects, casts a dishonorable suspicion upon that young girl; a
      sensation, indeed, which will embroil her with the vicomte. The
      consequence is that De Wardes&rsquo;s pistol-bullet has had three results
      instead of one; it destroys at the same time the honor of a woman, the
      happiness of a man, and, perhaps, it has wounded to death one of the best
      gentlemen in France. Oh, Madame! your logic is cold&mdash;even
      calculating; it always condemns&mdash;it never absolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp&rsquo;s concluding words scattered to the winds the last doubt which
      lingered, not in Madame&rsquo;s heart, but in her mind. She was no longer a
      princess full of scruples, nor a woman with her ever-returning suspicions,
      but one whose heart has just felt the mortal chill of a wound. &ldquo;Wounded to
      death!&rdquo; she murmured, in a faltering voice, &ldquo;oh, Monsieur de Manicamp! did
      you not say, wounded to death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp returned no other answer than a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you said that the comte is dangerously wounded?&rdquo; continued the
      princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame; one of his hands is shattered, and he has a bullet lodged in
      his breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heavens!&rdquo; resumed the princess, with a feverish excitement,
      &ldquo;this is horrible! Monsieur de Manicamp! a hand shattered, do you say, and
      a bullet in his breast? And that coward! that wretch! that assassin, De
      Wardes, did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp seemed overcome by a violent emotion. He had, in fact, displayed
      no little energy in the latter part of his speech. As for Madame, she
      entirely threw aside all regard for the formal observances of propriety
      society imposes; for when, with her, passion spoke in accents either of
      anger or sympathy, nothing could restrain her impulses. Madame approached
      Manicamp, who had subsided in a chair, as if his grief were a sufficiently
      powerful excuse for his infraction of the laws of etiquette. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo;
       she said, seizing him by the hand, &ldquo;be frank with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is M. de Guiche in danger of death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubly so, Madame,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;in the first place on account of the
      hemorrhage which has taken place, an artery having been injured in the
      hand; and next, in consequence of the wound in his breast, which may, the
      doctor is afraid, at least, have injured some vital part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may die, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die, yes, Madame; and without even having had the consolation of knowing
      that you have been told of his devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; are you not his friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? oh, no, Madame; I will only tell M. de Guiche&mdash;if, indeed, he is
      still in a condition to hear me&mdash;I will only tell him what I have
      seen; that is, your cruelty to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur, you will not be guilty of such barbarity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Madame, I shall speak the truth, for nature is very energetic in
      a man of his age. The physicians are clever men, and if, by chance, the
      poor comte should survive his wound, I should not wish him to die of a
      wound of the heart, after surviving one of the body.&rdquo; Manicamp rose, and
      with an expression of profoundest respect, seemed to be desirous of taking
      leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame, stopping him with almost a suppliant
      air, &ldquo;you will be kind enough to tell me in what state your wounded friend
      is, and who is the physician who attends him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As regards the state he is in, Madame, he is seriously ill; his physician
      is M. Valot, his majesty&rsquo;s private medical attendant. M. Valot is moreover
      assisted by a professional friend, to whose house M. de Guiche has been
      carried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! he is not in the chateau?&rdquo; said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, Madame! the poor fellow was so ill, that he could not even be
      conveyed thither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the address, monsieur,&rdquo; said the princess, hurriedly; &ldquo;I will
      send to inquire after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue du Feurre; a brick-built house, with white outside blinds. The
      doctor&rsquo;s name is on the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are returning to your wounded friend, Monsieur de Manicamp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be able, then, to do me a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your highness&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what you intended to do; return to M. de Guiche, send away all those
      whom you may find there, and have the kindness yourself to go away too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us waste no time in useless explanations. Accept the fact as I
      present it to you; see nothing in it beyond what is really there, and ask
      nothing further than what I tell you. I am going to send one of my ladies,
      perhaps two, because it is now getting late; I do not wish them to see
      you, or rather I do not wish you to see them. These are scruples you can
      understand&mdash;you particularly, Monsieur de Manicamp, who seem capable
      of divining so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Madame, perfectly; I can even do better still,&mdash;I will precede,
      or rather walk, in advance of your attendants; it will, at the same time,
      be the means of showing them the way more accurately, and of protecting
      them, if occasion arises, though there is no probability of their needing
      protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, by this means, then, they would be sure of entering without
      difficulty, would they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Madame; for as I should be the first to pass, I thus remove
      any difficulties that might chance to be in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Go, go, Monsieur de Manicamp, and wait at the bottom of the
      staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go at once, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you hear the footsteps of two women descending the stairs, go out,
      and, without once turning round, take the road which leads to where the
      poor count is lying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if, by any mischance, two other persons were to descend, and I were
      to be mistaken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will hear one of the two clap her hands together softly. Go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp turned round, bowed once more, and left the room, his heart
      overflowing with joy. In fact, he knew very well that the presence of
      Madame herself would be the best balm to apply to his friend&rsquo;s wounds. A
      quarter of an hour had hardly elapsed when he heard the sound of a door
      opened softly, and closed with like precaution. He listened to the light
      footfalls gliding down the staircase, and then heard the signal agreed
      upon. He immediately went out, and, faithful to his promise, bent his way,
      without once turning his head, through the streets of Fontainebleau,
      towards the doctor&rsquo;s dwelling.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXI. M. Malicorne the Keeper of the Records of France.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two women, their figures completely concealed by their mantles, and whose
      masks effectually hid the upper portion of their faces, timidly followed
      Manicamp&rsquo;s steps. On the first floor, behind curtains of red damask, the
      soft light of a lamp placed upon a low table faintly illumined the room,
      at the other extremity of which, on a large bedstead supported by spiral
      columns, around which curtains of the same color as those which deadened
      the rays of the lamp had been closely drawn, lay De Guiche, his head
      supported by pillows, his eyes looking as if the mists of death were
      gathering; his long black hair, scattered over the pillow, set off the
      young man&rsquo;s hollow temples. It was easy to see that fever was the chief
      tenant of the chamber. De Guiche was dreaming. His wandering mind was
      pursuing, through gloom and mystery, one of those wild creations delirium
      engenders. Two or three drops of blood, still liquid, stained the floor.
      Manicamp hurriedly ran up the stairs, but paused at the threshold of the
      door, looked into the room, and seeing that everything was perfectly
      quiet, he advanced towards the foot of the large leathern armchair, a
      specimen of furniture of the reign of Henry IV., and seeing that the
      nurse, as a matter of course, had dropped off to sleep, he awoke her, and
      begged her to pass into the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, standing by the side of the bed, he remained for a moment
      deliberating whether it would be better to awaken Guiche, in order to
      acquaint him with the good news. But, as he began to hear behind the door
      the rustling of silk dresses and the hurried breathing of his two
      companions, and as he already saw that the curtain screening the doorway
      seemed on the point of being impatiently drawn aside, he passed round the
      bed and followed the nurse into the next room. As soon as he had
      disappeared the curtain was raised, and his two female companions entered
      the room he had just left. The one who entered first made a gesture to her
      companion, which riveted her to the spot where she stood, close to the
      door, and then resolutely advanced towards the bed, drew back the curtains
      along the iron rod, and threw them in thick folds behind the head of the
      bed. She gazed upon the comte&rsquo;s pallid face; remarked his right hand
      enveloped in linen whose dazzling whiteness was emphasized by the
      counterpane patterned with dark leaves thrown across the couch. She
      shuddered as she saw a stain of blood growing larger and larger upon the
      bandages. The young man&rsquo;s breast was uncovered, as though for the cool
      night air to assist his respiration. A narrow bandage fastened the
      dressings of the wound, around which a purplish circle of extravasated
      blood was gradually increasing in size. A deep sigh broke from her lips.
      She leaned against one of the columns of the bed, and gazed, through the
      apertures in her mask, upon the harrowing spectacle before her. A hoarse
      harsh groan passed like a death-rattle through the comte&rsquo;s clenched teeth.
      The masked lady seized his left hand, which scorched like burning coals.
      But at the very moment she placed her icy hand upon it, the action of the
      cold was such that De Guiche opened his eyes, and by a look in which
      revived intelligence was dawning, seemed as though struggling back again
      into existence. The first thing upon which he fixed his gaze was this
      phantom standing erect by his bedside. At that sight, his eyes became
      dilated, but without any appearance of consciousness in them. The lady
      thereupon made a sign to her companion, who had remained at the door; and
      in all probability the latter had already received her lesson, for in a
      clear tone of voice, and without any hesitation whatever, she pronounced
      these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Monsieur le comte, her royal highness Madame is
      desirous of knowing how you are able to bear your wound, and to express to
      you, by my lips, her great regret at seeing you suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she pronounced the word Madame, Guiche started; he had not as yet
      remarked the person to whom the voice belonged, and he naturally turned
      towards the direction whence it preceded. But, as he felt the cold hand
      still resting on his own, he again turned towards the motionless figure
      beside him. &ldquo;Was it you who spoke, madame?&rdquo; he asked, in a weak voice, &ldquo;or
      is there another person in beside you in the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the figure, in an almost unintelligible voice, as she bent
      down her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the wounded man, with a great effort, &ldquo;I thank you. Tell
      Madame that I no longer regret to die, since she has remembered me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words &ldquo;to die,&rdquo; pronounced by one whose life seemed to hang on a
      thread, the masked lady could not restrain her tears, which flowed under
      the mask, and appeared upon her cheeks just where the mask left her face
      bare. If De Guiche had been in fuller possession of his senses, he would
      have seen her tears roll like glistening pearls, and fall upon his bed.
      The lady, forgetting that she wore her mask, raised her hand as though to
      wipe her eyes, and meeting the rough velvet, she tore away her mask in
      anger, and threw it on the floor. At the unexpected apparition before him,
      which seemed to issue from a cloud, De Guiche uttered a cry and stretched
      his arms towards her; but every word perished on his lips, and his
      strength seemed utterly abandoning him. His right hand, which had followed
      his first impulse, without calculating the amount of strength he had left,
      fell back again upon the bed, and immediately afterwards the white linen
      was stained with a larger spot than before. In the meantime, the young
      man&rsquo;s eyes became dim, and closed, as if he were already struggling with
      the messenger of death; and then, after a few involuntary movements, his
      head fell back motionless on his pillow; his face grew livid. The lady was
      frightened; but on this occasion, contrary to what is usually the case,
      fear attracted. She leaned over the young man, gazed earnestly, fixedly at
      his pale, cold face, which she almost touched, then imprinted a rapid kiss
      upon De Guiche&rsquo;s left hand, who, trembling as if an electric shock had
      passed through him, awoke a second time, opened his large eyes, incapable
      of recognition, and again fell into a state of complete insensibility.
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said to her companion, &ldquo;we must not remain here any longer; I
      shall be committing some folly or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, Madame, your highness is forgetting your mask!&rdquo; said her vigilant
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick it up,&rdquo; replied her mistress, as she tottered almost senseless
      towards the staircase, and as the outer door had been left only
      half-closed, the two women, light as birds, passed through it, and with
      hurried steps returned to the palace. One of them ascended towards
      Madame&rsquo;s apartments, where she disappeared; the other entered the rooms
      belonging to the maids of honor, namely, on the <i>entresol</i>, and
      having reached her own room, she sat down before a table, and without
      giving herself time even to breathe, wrote the following letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening Madame has been to see M. de Guiche. Everything is going
      well on this side. See that your news is equally exemplary, and do not
      forget to burn this paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She folded the letter, and leaving her room with every possible
      precaution, crossed a corridor which led to the apartments appropriated to
      the gentlemen attached to Monsieur&rsquo;s service. She stopped before a door,
      under which, having previously knocked twice in a short, quick manner, she
      thrust the paper, and fled. Then, returning to her own room, she removed
      every trace of her having gone out, and also of having written the letter.
      Amid the investigations she was so diligently pursuing she perceived on
      the table the mask which belonged to Madame, and which, according to her
      mistress&rsquo;s directions, she had brought back but had forgotten to restore
      to her. &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I must not forget to do to-morrow what I have
      forgotten to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she took hold of the velvet mask by that part which covered the
      cheeks, and feeling that her thumb was wet, looked at it. It was not only
      wet, but reddened. The mask had fallen upon one of the spots of blood
      which, we have already said, stained the floor, and from that black velvet
      outside which had accidentally come into contact with it, the blood had
      passed through to the inside, and stained the white cambric lining. &ldquo;Oh,
      oh!&rdquo; said Montalais, for doubtless our readers have already recognized her
      by these various maneuvers, &ldquo;I shall not give back this mask; it is far
      too precious now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And rising from her seat, she ran towards a box made of maple wood, which
      inclosed different articles of toilette and perfumery. &ldquo;No, not here,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;such a treasure must not be abandoned to the slightest chance of
      detection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, and with a smile that was peculiarly her
      own, she added:&mdash;&ldquo;Beautiful mask, stained with the blood of that
      brave knight, you shall go and join that collection of wonders, La
      Valliere&rsquo;s and Raoul&rsquo;s letters, that loving collection, indeed, which will
      some day or other form part of the history of France, of European royalty.
      You shall be placed under M. Malicorne&rsquo;s care,&rdquo; said the laughing girl, as
      she began to undress herself, &ldquo;under the protection of that worthy M.
      Malicorne,&rdquo; she said, blowing out the taper, &ldquo;who thinks he was born only
      to become the chief usher of Monsieur&rsquo;s apartments, and whom I will make
      keeper of the records and historiographer of the house of Bourbon, and of
      the first houses in the kingdom. Let him grumble now, that discontented
      Malicorne,&rdquo; she added, as she drew the curtains and fell asleep.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXII. The Journey.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day being agreed upon for the departure, the king, at eleven
      o&rsquo;clock precisely, descended the grand staircase with the two queens and
      Madame, in order to enter his carriage drawn by six horses, that were
      pawing the ground in impatience at the foot of the staircase. The whole
      court awaited the royal appearance in the <i>Fer-a-cheval</i> crescent, in
      their travelling costumes; the large number of saddled horses and
      carriages of ladies and gentlemen of the court, surrounded by their
      attendants, servants, and pages, formed a spectacle whose brilliancy could
      scarcely be equalled. The king entered his carriage with the two queens;
      Madame was in the same one with Monsieur. The maids of honor followed
      their example, and took their seats, two by two, in the carriages destined
      for them. The weather was exceedingly warm; a light breeze, which, early
      in the morning, all had thought would have proved sufficient to cool the
      air, soon became fiercely heated by the rays of the sun, although it was
      hidden behind the clouds, and filtered through the heated vapor which rose
      from the ground like a scorching wind, bearing particles of fine dust
      against the faces of the travelers. Madame was the first to complain of
      the heat. Monsieur&rsquo;s only reply was to throw himself back in the carriage
      as though about to faint, and to inundate himself with scents and
      perfumes, uttering the deepest sighs all the while; whereupon Madame said
      to him, with her most amiable expression:&mdash;&ldquo;Really, Monsieur, I
      fancied that you would have been polite enough, on account of the terrible
      heat, to have left me my carriage to myself, and to have performed the
      journey yourself on horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride on horseback!&rdquo; cried the prince, with an accent of dismay which
      showed how little idea he had of adopting this unnatural advice; &ldquo;you
      cannot suppose such a thing, Madame! My skin would peel off if I were to
      expose myself to such a burning breeze as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take my parasol,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the trouble of holding it!&rdquo; replied Monsieur, with the greatest
      coolness; &ldquo;besides, I have no horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, no horse?&rdquo; replied the princess, who, if she did not secure the
      solitude she required, at least obtained the amusement of teasing. &ldquo;No
      horse! You are mistaken, Monsieur; for I see your favorite bay out
      yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bay horse!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, attempting to lean forward to look
      out of the door; but the movement he was obliged to make cost him so much
      trouble that he soon hastened to resume his immobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madame; &ldquo;your horse, led by M. de Malicorne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor beast,&rdquo; replied the prince; &ldquo;how warm it must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he closed his eyes, like a man on the point of death.
      Madame, on her side, reclined indolently in the other corner of the
      carriage, and closed her eyes also, not, however, to sleep, but to think
      more at her ease. In the meantime the king, seated in the front seat of
      his carriage, the back of which he had yielded up to the two queens, was a
      prey to that feverish contrariety experienced by anxious lovers, who,
      without being able to quench their ardent thirst, are ceaselessly desirous
      of seeing the loved object, and then go away partially satisfied, without
      perceiving they have acquired a more insatiable thirst than ever. The
      king, whose carriage headed the procession, could not from the place he
      occupied perceive the carriages of the ladies and maids of honor, which
      followed in a line behind it. Besides, he was obliged to answer the
      eternal questions of the young queen, who, happy to have with her &ldquo;<i>her
      dear husband</i>,&rdquo; as she called him in utter forgetfulness of royal
      etiquette, invested him with all her affection, stifled him with her
      attentions, afraid that some one might come to take him from her, or that
      he himself might suddenly take a fancy to quit her society. Anne of
      Austria, whom nothing at that moment occupied except the occasional cruel
      throbbings in her bosom, looked pleased and delighted, and although she
      perfectly realized the king&rsquo;s impatience, tantalizingly prolonged his
      sufferings by unexpectedly resuming the conversation at the very moment
      the king, absorbed in his own reflections, began to muse over his secret
      attachment. Everything seemed to combine&mdash;not alone the little
      teasing attentions of the queen, but also the queen-mother&rsquo;s interruptions&mdash;to
      make the king&rsquo;s position almost insupportable; for he knew not how to
      control the restless longings of his heart. At first, he complained of the
      heat&mdash;a complaint merely preliminary to others, but with sufficient
      tact to prevent Maria Theresa guessing his real object. Understanding the
      king&rsquo;s remark literally, she began to fan him with her ostrich plumes. But
      the heat passed away, and the king then complained of cramps and stiffness
      in his legs, and as the carriages at that moment stopped to change horses,
      the queen said:&mdash;&ldquo;Shall I get out with you? I too feel tired of
      sitting. We can walk on a little distance; the carriage will overtake us,
      and we can resume our places presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king frowned; it is a hard trial a jealous woman makes her husband
      submit to whose fidelity she suspects, when, although herself a prey to
      jealousy, she watches herself so narrowly that she avoids giving any
      pretext for an angry feeling. The king, therefore, in the present case,
      could not refuse; he accepted the offer, alighted from the carriage, gave
      his arm to the queen, and walked up and down with her while the horses
      were being changed. As he walked along, he cast an envious glance upon the
      courtiers, who were fortunate enough to be on horseback. The queen soon
      found out that the promenade she had suggested afforded the king as little
      pleasure as he had experienced from driving. She accordingly expressed a
      wish to return to her carriage, and the king conducted her to the door,
      but did not get in with her. He stepped back a few paces, and looked along
      the file of carriages for the purpose of recognizing the one in which he
      took so strong an interest. At the door of the sixth carriage he saw La
      Valliere&rsquo;s fair countenance. As the king thus stood motionless, wrapt in
      thought, without perceiving that everything was ready, and that he alone
      was causing the delay, he heard a voice close beside him, addressing him
      in the most respectful manner. It was M. Malicorne, in a complete costume
      of an equerry, holding over his left arm the bridles of a couple of
      horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty asked for a horse, I believe,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horse? Have you one of my horses here?&rdquo; inquired the king, trying to
      remember the person who addressed him, and whose face was not as yet
      familiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Malicorne, &ldquo;at all events I have a horse here which is at
      your majesty&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Malicorne pointed at Monsieur&rsquo;s bay horse, which Madame had observed.
      It was a beautiful creature royally caparisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not one of my horses, monsieur,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is a horse out of his royal highness&rsquo;s stables; but he does not
      ride when the weather is as hot as it is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis did not reply, but approached the horse, which stood pawing the
      ground with its foot. Malicorne hastened to hold the stirrup for him, but
      the king was already in the saddle. Restored to good-humor by this lucky
      accident, the king hastened towards the queen&rsquo;s carriage, where he was
      anxiously expected; and notwithstanding Maria Theresa&rsquo;s thoughtful and
      preoccupied air, he said: &ldquo;I have been fortunate enough to find this
      horse, and I intend to avail myself of it. I felt stifled in the carriage.
      Adieu, ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then bending gracefully over the arched neck of his beautiful steed, he
      disappeared in a second. Anne of Austria leaned forward, in order to look
      after him as he rode away; he did not get very far, for when he reached
      the sixth carriage, he reined in his horse suddenly and took off his hat.
      He saluted La Valliere, who uttered a cry of surprise as she saw him,
      blushing at the same time with pleasure. Montalais, who occupied the other
      seat in the carriage, made the king a most respectful bow. And then, with
      all the tact of a woman, she pretended to be exceedingly interested in the
      landscape, and withdrew herself into the left-hand corner. The
      conversation between the king and La Valliere began, as all lovers&rsquo; 
      conversations generally do, namely, by eloquent looks and by a few words
      utterly devoid of common sense. The king explained how warm he had felt in
      his carriage, so much so indeed that he could almost regard the horse he
      then rode as a blessing thrown in his way. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;my benefactor
      is an exceedingly intelligent man, for he seemed to guess my thoughts
      intuitively. I have now only one wish, that of learning the name of the
      gentleman who so cleverly assisted his king out of his dilemma, and
      extricated him from his cruel position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais, during this colloquy, the first words of which had awakened her
      attention, had slightly altered her position, and contrived so as to meet
      the king&rsquo;s look as he finished his remark. It followed very naturally that
      the king looked inquiringly as much at her as at La Valliere; she had
      every reason to suppose that it was herself who was appealed to, and
      consequently might be permitted to answer. She therefore said: &ldquo;Sire, the
      horse which your majesty is riding belongs to Monsieur, and was being led
      by one of his royal highness&rsquo;s gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that gentleman&rsquo;s name, may I ask, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Malicorne, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name produced its usual effect, for the king repeated it smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; replied Aure. &ldquo;Stay, it is the gentleman who is galloping on
      my left hand;&rdquo; and she pointed out Malicorne, who, with a very sanctified
      expression, was galloping by the side of the carriage, knowing perfectly
      well that they were talking of him at that very moment, but sitting in his
      saddle as if he were deaf and dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;that is the gentleman; I remember his face, and
      will not forget his name;&rdquo; and the king looked tenderly at La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aure had now nothing further to do; she had let Malicorne&rsquo;s name fall; the
      soil was good; all that was now left to be done was to let the name take
      root, and the event would bear fruit in due season. She consequently threw
      herself back in her corner, feeling perfectly justified in making as many
      agreeable signs of recognition as she liked to Malicorne, since the latter
      had had the happiness of pleasing the king. As will readily be believed,
      Montalais was not mistaken; and Malicorne, with his quick ear and his sly
      look, seemed to interpret her remark as &ldquo;All goes on well,&rdquo; the whole
      being accompanied by a pantomimic action, which he fancied conveyed
      something resembling a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the king, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;the liberty
      and freedom of the country is soon about to cease; your attendance on
      Madame will be more strictly enforced, and we shall see each other no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is too much attached to Madame,&rdquo; replied Louise, &ldquo;not to
      come and see her very frequently; and whenever your majesty may chance to
      pass across the apartments&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the king, in a tender voice, which was gradually lowered in its
      tone, &ldquo;to perceive is not to see, and yet it seems that it would be quite
      sufficient for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louise did not answer a syllable; a sigh filled her heart almost to
      bursting, but she stifled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You exercise a great control over yourself,&rdquo; said the king to Louise, who
      smiled upon him with a melancholy expression. &ldquo;Exert the strength you have
      in loving fondly,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I will bless Heaven for having
      bestowed it on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere still remained silent, but raised her eyes, brimful of
      affection, toward the king. Louis, as if overcome by this burning glance,
      passed his hand across his forehead, and pressing the sides of his horse
      with his knees, made him bound several paces forward. La Valliere, leaning
      back in her carriage, with her eyes half closed, gazed fixedly upon the
      king, whose plumes were floating in the air; she could not but admire his
      graceful carriage, his delicate and nervous limbs which pressed his
      horse&rsquo;s sides, and the regular outline of his features, which his
      beautiful curling hair set off to great advantage, revealing occasionally
      his small and well-formed ear. In fact the poor girl was in love, and she
      reveled in her innocent affection. In a few moments the king was again by
      her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not perceive,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how terribly your silence affects me? Oh!
      mademoiselle, how pitilessly inexorable you would become if you were ever
      to resolve to break off all acquaintance with any one; and then, too, I
      think you changeable; in fact&mdash;in fact, I dread this deep affection
      which fills my whole being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, you are mistaken,&rdquo; said La Valliere; &ldquo;if ever I love, it will
      be for all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you love, you say,&rdquo; exclaimed the king; &ldquo;you do <i>not</i> love now,
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hid her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;that I am right in accusing you; you must admit
      you are changeable, capricious, a coquette, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! sire, be perfectly satisfied as to that. No, I say again; no,
      no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me, then, that to me you will always be the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! always, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will never show any of that severity which would break my heart,
      none of that fickleness of manner which would be worse than death to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then! but listen. I like promises, I like to place under the
      guarantee of an oath, under the protection of Heaven, in fact, everything
      which interests my heart and my affections. Promise me, or rather swear to
      me, that if in the life we are about to commence, a life which will be
      full of sacrifice, mystery, anxiety, disappointment, and misunderstanding;
      swear to me that if we should in any way deceive, or misunderstand each
      other, or should judge each other unjustly, for that indeed would be
      criminal in love such as ours; swear to me, Louise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She trembled with agitation to the very depths of her heart; it was the
      first time she had heard her name pronounced in that manner by her royal
      lover. As for the king, taking off his glove, and placing his hand within
      the carriage, he continued:&mdash;&ldquo;Swear, that never in all our quarrels
      will we allow one night even to pass by, if any misunderstanding should
      arise between us, without a visit, or at least a message, from either, in
      order to convey consolation and repose to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere took her lover&rsquo;s burning hand between her own cool palms, and
      pressed it softly, until a movement of the horse, frightened by the
      proximity of the wheels, obliged her to abandon her happiness. She had
      vowed as he desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return, sire,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;return to the queen. I foresee a storm yonder,
      which threatens my peace of mind and yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis obeyed, saluted Mademoiselle de Montalais, and set off at a gallop
      to rejoin the queen. As he passed Monsieur&rsquo;s carriage, he observed that he
      was fast asleep, although Madame, on her part, was wide awake. As the king
      passed her she said, &ldquo;What a beautiful horse, sire! Is it not Monsieur&rsquo;s
      bay horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young queen kindly asked, &ldquo;Are you better now, sire?&rdquo; <a

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIII. Triumfeminate.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the king&rsquo;s arrival in Paris, he sat at the council which had been
      summoned, and worked for a certain portion of the day. The queen remained
      with the queen-mother, and burst into tears as soon as she had taken leave
      of the king. &ldquo;Ah, madame!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the king no longer loves me! What
      will become of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A husband always loves his wife when she is like you,&rdquo; replied Anne of
      Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A time may come when he will love another woman instead of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call loving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always thinking of a person&mdash;always seeking her society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to have remarked,&rdquo; said Anne of Austria, &ldquo;that the king has
      ever done anything of the sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; said the young queen, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to complain of, then, Marie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will admit that the king leaves me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king, my daughter, belongs to his people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is the very reason why he no longer belongs to me; and that is
      the reason, too, why I shall find myself, as so many queens before me,
      forsaken and forgotten, whilst glory and honors will be reserved for
      others. Oh, my mother! the king is so handsome! how often will others tell
      him that they love him, and how much, indeed, they must do so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very seldom, indeed, that women love the man in loving the king.
      But if such a thing happened, which I doubt, you would do better to wish,
      Marie, that such women should really love your husband. In the first
      place, the devoted love of a mistress is a rapid element of the
      dissolution of a lover&rsquo;s affection; and then, by dint of loving, the
      mistress loses all influence over her lover, whose power of wealth she
      does not covet, caring only for his affection. Wish, therefore, that the
      king should love but lightly, and that his mistress should love with all
      her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my mother, what power may not a deep affection exercise over him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you say you are resigned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, quite true; I speak absurdly. There is a feeling of anguish,
      however, which I can never control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king may make a happy choice&mdash;may find a home, with all the
      tender influences of home, not far from that we can offer him,&mdash;a
      home with children round him, the children of another woman. Oh, madame! I
      should die if I were but to see the king&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, Marie,&rdquo; replied the queen-mother with a smile, and she took the
      young queen&rsquo;s hand in her own, &ldquo;remember what I am going to say, and let
      it always be a consolation to you: the king cannot have a Dauphin without
      <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this remark the queen-mother quitted her daughter-in-law, in order to
      meet Madame, whose arrival in the grand cabinet had just been announced by
      one of the pages. Madame had scarcely taken time to change her dress. Her
      face revealed her agitation, which betrayed a plan, the execution of which
      occupied, while the result disturbed, her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to ascertain,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if your majesties are suffering any
      fatigue from our journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; said the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; replied Maria Theresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have suffered from annoyance more than anything else,&rdquo; said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; inquired Anne of Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fatigue the king undergoes in riding about on horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does the king good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was I who advised him,&rdquo; said Maria Theresa, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame said not a word in reply; but one of those smiles which were
      peculiarly her own flitted for a moment across her lips, without passing
      over the rest of her face; then, immediately changing the conversation,
      she continued, &ldquo;We shall find Paris precisely the Paris we quitted; the
      same intrigues, plots, and flirtations going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intrigues! What intrigues do you allude to?&rdquo; inquired the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People are talking a good deal about M. Fouquet and Madame
      Plessis-Belliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who makes up the number to about ten thousand,&rdquo; replied the queen-mother.
      &ldquo;But what are the plots you speak of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have, it seems, certain misunderstandings with Holland to settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has been telling me the story of the medals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the young queen, &ldquo;you mean those medals struck in Holland,
      on which a cloud is seen passing across the sun, which is the king&rsquo;s
      device. You are wrong in calling that a plot&mdash;it is an insult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But so contemptible that the king can well despise it,&rdquo; replied the
      queen-mother. &ldquo;Well, what are the flirtations which are alluded to? Do you
      mean that of Madame d&rsquo;Olonne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; nearer ourselves than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Casa de usted</i>,&rdquo; murmured the queen-mother, and without moving her
      lips, in her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s ear, without being overheard by Madame, who
      thus continued:&mdash;&ldquo;You know the terrible news?&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-4"
       name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; M. de Guiche&rsquo;s wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you attribute it, I suppose, as every one else does, to an accident
      which happened to him while hunting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said both the queens together, their interest awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame drew closer to them, as she said, in a low tone of voice, &ldquo;It was a
      duel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Anne of Austria, in a severe tone; for, in her ears, the word
      &ldquo;duel,&rdquo; which had been forbidden in France all the time she reigned over
      it, had a strange sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most deplorable duel, which has nearly cost Monsieur two of his best
      friends, and the king two of his best servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the cause of the duel?&rdquo; inquired the young queen, animated by a
      secret instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flirtation,&rdquo; repeated Madame, triumphantly. &ldquo;The gentlemen in question
      were conversing about the virtue of a particular lady belonging to the
      court. One of them thought that Pallas was a very second-rate person
      compared to her; the other pretended that the lady in question was an
      imitation of Venus alluring Mars; and thereupon the two gentlemen fought
      as fiercely as Hector and Achilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Venus alluring Mars?&rdquo; said the young queen in a low tone of voice without
      venturing to examine into the allegory very deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the lady?&rdquo; inquired Anne of Austria abruptly. &ldquo;You said, I
      believe, she was one of the ladies of honor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say so?&rdquo; replied Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; at least I thought I heard you mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not aware that such a woman is of ill-omen to a royal house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&rdquo; said the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, that plain-looking creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought she was affianced to a gentleman who certainly is not, at least
      so I have heard, either M. de Guiche or M. de Wardes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young queen took up a piece of tapestry, and began to broider with an
      affectation of tranquillity her trembling fingers contradicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you saying about Venus and Mars?&rdquo; pursued the queen-mother. &ldquo;Is
      there a Mars also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She boasts of that being the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say she boasts of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the cause of the duel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. de Guiche upheld the cause of Mars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly; like the devoted servant he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devoted servant of whom?&rdquo; exclaimed the young queen, forgetting her
      reserve in allowing her jealous feeling to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars, not to be defended except at the expense of Venus,&rdquo; replied Madame.
      &ldquo;M. de Guiche maintained the perfect innocence of Mars, and no doubt
      affirmed that it was all a mere boast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. de Wardes,&rdquo; said Anne of Austria, quietly, &ldquo;spread the report that
      Venus was within her rights, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, De Wardes,&rdquo; thought Madame, &ldquo;you shall pay dearly for the wound you
      have given that noblest&mdash;best of men!&rdquo; And she began to attack De
      Wardes with the greatest bitterness; thus discharging her own and De
      Guiche&rsquo;s debt, with the assurance that she was working the future ruin of
      her enemy. She said so much, in fact, that had Manicamp been there, he
      would have regretted he had shown such firm regard for his friend,
      inasmuch as it resulted in the ruin of his unfortunate foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing in the whole affair but <i>one</i> cause of mischief, and
      that is La Valliere herself,&rdquo; said the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young queen resumed her work with perfect indifference of manner,
      while Madame listened eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not yet quite understand what you said just now about the danger of
      coquetry,&rdquo; resumed Anne of Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; Madame hastened to say, &ldquo;that if the girl had not been
      a coquette, Mars would not have thought at all about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The repetition of this word Mars brought a passing color to the queen&rsquo;s
      face; but she still continued her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not permit that, in my court, gentlemen should be set against each
      other in this manner,&rdquo; said Anne of Austria, calmly. &ldquo;Such manners were
      useful enough, perhaps, in days when the divided nobility had no other
      rallying-point than mere gallantry. At that time women, whose sway was
      absolute and undivided, were privileged to encourage men&rsquo;s valor by
      frequent trials of their courage. But now, thank Heaven, there is but one
      master in France, and to him every instinct of the mind, every pulse of
      the body are due. I will not allow my son to be deprived of any single one
      of his servants.&rdquo; And she turned towards the young queen, saying, &ldquo;What is
      to be done with this La Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Valliere?&rdquo; said the queen, apparently surprised, &ldquo;I do not even know
      the name;&rdquo; and she accompanied this remark by one of those cold, fixed
      smiles only to be observed on royal lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame was herself a princess great in every respect, great in
      intelligence, great by birth, by pride; the queen&rsquo;s reply, however,
      completely astonished her, and she was obliged to pause for a moment in
      order to recover herself. &ldquo;She is one of my maids of honor,&rdquo; she replied,
      with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; retorted Maria Theresa, in the same tone, &ldquo;it is your
      affair, my sister, and not ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; resumed Anne of Austria, &ldquo;it is my affair. And I
      perfectly well understand,&rdquo; she pursued, addressing a look full of
      intelligence at Madame, &ldquo;Madame&rsquo;s motive for saying what she has just
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything which emanates from you, madame,&rdquo; said the English princess,
      &ldquo;proceeds from the lips of Wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we send this girl back to her own family,&rdquo; said Maria Theresa, gently,
      &ldquo;we must bestow a pension upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I will provide for out of my income,&rdquo; exclaimed Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interrupted Anne of Austria, &ldquo;no disturbance, I beg. The king
      dislikes that the slightest disrespectful remark should be made of any
      lady. Let everything be done quietly. Will you have the kindness, Madame,
      to send for this girl here; and you, my daughter, will have the goodness
      to retire to your own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dowager queen&rsquo;s entreaties were commands, and as Maria Theresa rose to
      return to her apartments, Madame rose in order to send a page to summon La
      Valliere.

      Chapter XXIV. The First Quarrel.
    </h2>
    <p>
      La Valliere entered the queen-mother&rsquo;s apartments without in the least
      suspecting that a serious plot was being concerted against her. She
      thought it was for something connected with her duties, and never had the
      queen-mother been unkind to her when such was the case. Besides, not being
      immediately under the control or direction of Anne of Austria, she could
      only have an official connection with her, to which her own gentleness of
      disposition, and the rank of the august princess, made her yield on every
      occasion with the best possible grace. She therefore advanced towards the
      queen-mother with that soft and gentle smile which constituted her
      principal charm, and as she did not approach sufficiently close, Anne of
      Austria signed to her to come nearer. Madame then entered the room, and
      with a perfectly calm air took her seat beside her mother-in-law, and
      continued the work which Maria Theresa had begun. When La Valliere,
      instead of the direction which she expected to receive immediately on
      entering the room, perceived these preparations, she looked with
      curiosity, if not with uneasiness, at the two princesses. Anne seemed full
      of thought, while Madame maintained an affectation of indifference that
      would have alarmed a less timid person even than Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the queen-mother suddenly, without attempting to
      moderate or disguise her Spanish accent, which she never failed to do
      except when she was angry, &ldquo;come closer; we were talking of you, as every
      one else seems to be doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me!&rdquo; exclaimed La Valliere, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you pretend to be ignorant of it; are you not aware of the duel
      between M. de Guiche and M. de Wardes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! I heard of it yesterday,&rdquo; said La Valliere, clasping her
      hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you not foresee this quarrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I, madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because two men never fight without a motive, and because you must be
      aware of the motive which awakened the animosity of the two in question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly ignorant of it, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A persevering denial is a very commonplace mode of defense, and you, who
      have great pretensions to be witty and clever, ought to avoid
      commonplaces. What else have you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madame, your majesty terrifies me with your cold severity of manner;
      but I do not understand how I can have incurred your displeasure, or in
      what respect people concern themselves about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will tell you. M. de Guiche has been obliged to undertake your
      defense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My defense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He is a gallant knight, and beautiful adventuresses like to see
      brave knights couch lances in their honor. But, for my part, I hate fields
      of battle, and above all I hate adventures, and&mdash;take my remark as
      you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere sank at the queen&rsquo;s feet, who turned her back upon her. She
      stretched out her hands towards Madame, who laughed in her face. A feeling
      of pride made her rise to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have begged your majesty to tell me what is the crime I am accused of&mdash;I
      can claim this at your hands; and I see I am condemned before I am even
      permitted to justify myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! indeed,&rdquo; cried Anne of Austria, &ldquo;listen to her beautiful phrases,
      Madame, and to her fine sentiments; she is an inexhaustible well of
      tenderness and heroic expressions. One can easily see, young lady, that
      you have cultivated your mind in the society of crowned heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere felt struck to the heart; she became, not whiter, but as white
      as a lily, and all her strength forsook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to inform you,&rdquo; interrupted the queen, disdainfully, &ldquo;that if
      you continue to nourish such feelings, you will humiliate us to such a
      degree that we shall be ashamed of appearing before you. Be simple in your
      manners. By the by, I am informed that you are affianced; is it the case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere pressed her hand over her heart, which was wrung with a fresh
      pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer when you are spoken to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Vicomte de Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware that it is an exceedingly fortunate circumstance for you,
      mademoiselle, that such is the case, and without fortune or position, as
      you are, or without any very great personal advantages, you ought to bless
      Heaven for having procured you such a future as seems to be in store for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere did not reply. &ldquo;Where is the Vicomte de Bragelonne?&rdquo; pursued
      the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England,&rdquo; said Madame, &ldquo;where the report of this young lady&rsquo;s success
      will not fail to reach him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Heaven!&rdquo; murmured La Valliere in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, mademoiselle!&rdquo; said Anne of Austria, &ldquo;we will get this young
      gentleman to return, and send you away somewhere with him. If you are of a
      different opinion&mdash;for girls have strange views and fancies at times&mdash;trust
      to me, I will put you in a proper path again. I have done as much for
      girls who are not as good as you are, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere ceased to hear the queen, who pitilessly added: &ldquo;I will send
      you somewhere, by yourself, where you will be able to indulge in a little
      serious reflection. Reflection calms the ardor of the blood, and swallows
      up the illusions of youth. I suppose you understand what I have been
      saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am innocent of everything your majesty supposes. Oh, madame! you are a
      witness of my despair. I love, I respect your majesty so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be far better not to respect me at all,&rdquo; said the queen, with a
      chilling irony of manner. &ldquo;It would be far better if you were not
      innocent. Do you presume to suppose that I should be satisfied simply to
      leave you unpunished if you had committed the fault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! you are killing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No acting, if you please, or I will precipitate the <i>denouement</i> of
      this <i>play</i>; leave the room; return to your own apartment, and I
      trust my lesson may be of service to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; said La Valliere to the Duchess d&rsquo;Orleans, whose hands she
      seized in her own, &ldquo;do you, who are so good, intercede for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; replied the latter, with an insulting joy, &ldquo;I&mdash;good!&mdash;Ah,
      mademoiselle, you think nothing of the kind;&rdquo; and with a rude, hasty
      gesture she repulsed the young girl&rsquo;s grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere, instead of giving way, as from her extreme pallor and her
      tears the two princesses possibly expected, suddenly resumed her calm and
      dignified air; she bowed profoundly, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Anne of Austria to Madame, &ldquo;do you think she will begin
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always suspect those gentle, patient characters,&rdquo; replied Madame.
      &ldquo;Nothing is more full of courage than a patient heart, nothing more
      self-reliant than a gentle spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel I may almost venture to assure you she will think twice before she
      looks at the god Mars again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as she does not obtain the protection of his buckler I do not
      care,&rdquo; retorted Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proud, defiant look of the queen-mother was the reply to this objection,
      which was by no means deficient in finesse; and both of them, almost sure
      of their victory, went to look for Maria Theresa, who had been waiting for
      them with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about half-past six in the evening, and the king had just partaken
      of refreshment. He lost no time; but the repast finished, and business
      matters settled, he took Saint-Aignan by the arm, and desired him to lead
      the way to La Valliere&rsquo;s apartments. The courtier uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is that for? It is a habit you will have to adopt, and in
      order to adopt a habit, one must make a beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire!&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;it is hardly possible: for every one can
      be seen entering or leaving those apartments. If, however, some pretext or
      other were made use of&mdash;if your majesty, for instance, would wait
      until Madame were in her own apartments&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No pretext; no delays. I have had enough of these impediments and
      mysteries; I cannot perceive in what respect the king of France dishonors
      himself by conversing with an amiable and clever girl. Evil be to him who
      evil thinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your majesty forgive an excess of zeal on my part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true; I always wish the most entire respect to be shown to her
      majesty. Well, then, this evening only will I pay Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere a visit, and after to-day I will make use of any pretext you
      like. To-morrow we will devise all sorts of means; to-night I have no
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan made no reply; he descended the steps, preceding the king,
      and crossed the different courtyards with a feeling of shame, which the
      distinguished honor of accompanying the king did not remove. The reason
      was that Saint-Aignan wished to stand well with Madame, as well as with
      the queens, and also, that he did not, on the other hand, want to
      displease Mademoiselle de la Valliere: and in order to carry out so many
      promising affairs, it was difficult to avoid jostling against some
      obstacle or other. Besides, the windows of the young queen&rsquo;s rooms, those
      of the queen-mother&rsquo;s, and of Madame herself, looked out upon the
      courtyard of the maids of honor. To be seen, therefore, accompanying the
      king, would be effectually to quarrel with three great and influential
      princesses&mdash;whose authority was unbounded&mdash;for the purpose of
      supporting the ephemeral credit of a mistress. The unhappy Saint-Aignan,
      who had not displayed a very great amount of courage in taking La
      Valliere&rsquo;s part in the park of Fontainebleau, did not feel any braver in
      the broad day-light, and found a thousand defects in the poor girl which
      he was most eager to communicate to the king. But his trial soon finished,&mdash;the
      courtyards were crossed; not a curtain was drawn aside, nor a window
      opened. The king walked hastily, because of his impatience, and the long
      legs of Saint-Aignan, who preceded him. At the door, however, Saint-Aignan
      wished to retire, but the king desired him to remain; a delicate
      consideration, on the king&rsquo;s part, which the courtier could very well have
      dispensed with. He had to follow Louis into La Valliere&rsquo;s apartment. As
      soon as the king arrived the young girl dried her tears, but so
      precipitately that the king perceived it. He questioned her most anxiously
      and tenderly, and pressed her to tell him the cause of her emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is the matter, sire,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you were weeping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, indeed, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Saint-Aignan, and tell me if I am mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan ought to have answered, but he was too much embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events your eyes are red, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dust of the road merely, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; you no longer possess the air of supreme contentment which
      renders you so beautiful and so attractive. You do not look at me. Why
      avoid my gaze?&rdquo; he said, as she turned aside her head. &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name,
      what is the matter?&rdquo; he inquired, beginning to lose command over himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all, sire; and I am perfectly ready to assure your majesty
      that my mind is as free from anxiety as you could possibly wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mind at ease, when I see you are embarrassed at the slightest thing.
      Has any one annoyed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist upon knowing if such really be the case,&rdquo; said the prince, his
      eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, sire, no one has in any way offended me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, pray resume your gentle air of gayety, or that sweet
      melancholy look which I so loved in you this morning; for pity&rsquo;s sake, do
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king tapped the floor impatiently with his foot, saying, &ldquo;Such a
      change is positively inexplicable.&rdquo; And he looked at Saint-Aignan, who had
      also remarked La Valliere&rsquo;s peculiar lethargy, as well as the king&rsquo;s
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was futile for the king to entreat, and as useless for him to try to
      overcome her depression: the poor girl was completely overwhelmed,&mdash;the
      appearance of an angel would hardly have awakened her from her torpor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king saw in her repeated negative replies a mystery full of
      unkindness; he began to look round the apartment with a suspicious air.
      There happened to be in La Valliere&rsquo;s room a miniature of Athos. The king
      remarked that this portrait bore a strong resemblance to Bragelonne, for
      it had been taken when the count was quite a young man. He looked at it
      with a threatening air. La Valliere, in her misery far indeed from
      thinking of this portrait, could not conjecture the cause of the king&rsquo;s
      preoccupation. And yet the king&rsquo;s mind was occupied with a terrible
      remembrance, which had more than once taken possession of his mind, but
      which he had always driven away. He recalled the intimacy existing between
      the two young people from their birth, their engagement, and that Athos
      himself had come to solicit La Valliere&rsquo;s hand for Raoul. He therefore
      could not but suppose that on her return to Paris, La Valliere had found
      news from London awaiting her, and that this news had counterbalanced the
      influence he had been enabled to exert over her. He immediately felt
      himself stung, as it were, by feelings of the wildest jealousy; and again
      questioned her, with increased bitterness. La Valliere could not reply,
      unless she were to acknowledge everything, which would be to accuse the
      queen, and Madame also; and the consequence would be, that she would have
      to enter into an open warfare with these two great and powerful
      princesses. She thought within herself that as she made no attempt to
      conceal from the king what was passing in her own mind, the king ought to
      be able to read in her heart, in spite of her silence; and that, had he
      really loved her, he would have understood and guessed everything. What
      was sympathy, then, if not that divine flame which possesses the property
      of enlightening the heart, and of saving lovers the necessity of an
      expression of their thoughts and feelings? She maintained her silence,
      therefore, sighing, and concealing her face in her hands. These sighs and
      tears, which had at first distressed, then terrified Louis XIV., now
      irritated him. He could not bear opposition,&mdash;the opposition which
      tears and sighs exhibited, any more than opposition of any other kind. His
      remarks, therefore, became bitter, urgent, and openly aggressive in their
      nature. This was a fresh cause of distress for the poor girl. From that
      very circumstance, therefore, which she regarded as an injustice on her
      lover&rsquo;s part, she drew sufficient courage to bear, not only her other
      troubles, but this one also.

      The king next began to accuse her in direct terms. La Valliere did not
      even attempt to defend herself; she endured all his accusations without
      according any other reply than that of shaking her head; without any other
      remark than that which escapes the heart in deep distress&mdash;a
      prayerful appeal to Heaven for help. But this ejaculation, instead of
      calming the king&rsquo;s displeasure, rather increased it. He, moreover, saw
      himself seconded by Saint-Aignan, for Saint-Aignan, as we have observed,
      having seen the storm increasing, and not knowing the extent of the regard
      of which Louis XIV. was capable, felt, by anticipation, all the collected
      wrath of the three princesses, and the near approach of poor La Valliere&rsquo;s
      downfall, and he was not true knight enough to resist the fear that he
      himself might be dragged down in the impending ruin. Saint-Aignan did not
      reply to the king&rsquo;s questions except by short, dry remarks, pronounced
      half-aloud; and by abrupt gestures, whose object was to make things worse,
      and bring about a misunderstanding, the result of which would be to free
      him from the annoyance of having to cross the courtyards in open day, in
      order to follow his illustrious companion to La Valliere&rsquo;s apartments. In
      the meantime the king&rsquo;s anger momentarily increased; he made two or three
      steps towards the door as if to leave the room, but returned. The young
      girl did not, however, raise her head, although the sound of his footsteps
      might have warned her that her lover was leaving her. He drew himself up,
      for a moment, before her, with his arms crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last time, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you speak? Will you
      assign a reason for this change, this fickleness, for this caprice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say?&rdquo; murmured La Valliere. &ldquo;Do you not see, sire, that I am
      completely overwhelmed at this moment; that I have no power of will, or
      thought, or speech?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so difficult, then, to speak the truth? You could have told me the
      whole truth in fewer words than those in which you have expressed
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the truth about what, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere was just on the point of revealing the truth to the king, her
      arms made a sudden movement as if they were about to open, but her lips
      remained silent, and her hands again fell listlessly by her side. The poor
      girl had not yet endured sufficient unhappiness to risk the necessary
      revelation. &ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; she stammered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, &ldquo;this is no longer mere coquetry, or caprice, it
      is treason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this time nothing could restrain him. The impulse of his heart was not
      sufficient to induce him to turn back, and he darted out of the room with
      a gesture full of despair. Saint-Aignan followed him, wishing for nothing
      better than to quit the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis XIV. did not pause until he reached the staircase, and grasping the
      balustrade, said: &ldquo;You see how shamefully I have been duped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, sire?&rdquo; inquired the favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Guiche fought on the Vicomte de Bragelonne&rsquo;s account, and this
      Bragelonne... oh! Saint-Aignan, she still loves him. I vow to you,
      Saint-Aignan, that if, in three days from now, there were to remain but an
      atom of affection for her in my heart, I should die from very shame.&rdquo; And
      the king resumed his way to his own apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told your majesty how it would be,&rdquo; murmured Saint-Aignan, continuing
      to follow the king, and timidly glancing up at the different windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately their return was not, like their arrival, unobserved. A
      curtain was suddenly drawn aside; Madame was behind it. She had seen the
      king leave the apartments of the maids of honor, and as soon as she
      observed that his majesty had passed, she left her own apartments with
      hurried steps, and ran up the staircase that led to the room the king had
      just left.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXV. Despair.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as the king was gone La Valliere raised herself from the ground,
      and stretched out her arms, as if to follow and detain him, but when,
      having violently closed the door, the sound of his retreating footsteps
      could be heard in the distance, she had hardly sufficient strength left to
      totter towards and fall at the foot of her crucifix. There she remained,
      broken-hearted, absorbed, and overwhelmed by her grief, forgetful and
      indifferent to everything but her profound sorrow;&mdash;a grief she only
      vaguely realized&mdash;as though by instinct. In the midst of this wild
      tumult of thoughts, La Valliere heard her door open again; she started,
      and turned round, thinking it was the king who had returned. She was
      deceived, however, for it was Madame who appeared at the door. What did
      she now care for Madame! Again she sank down, her head supported by her <i>prie-Dieu</i>
      chair. It was Madame, agitated, angry, and threatening. But what was that
      to her? &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the princess, standing before La Valliere,
      &ldquo;this is very fine, I admit, to kneel and pray, and make a pretense of
      being religious; but however submissive you may be in your address to
      Heaven, it is desirable that you should pay some little attention to the
      wishes of those who reign and rule here below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere raised her head painfully in token of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long since,&rdquo; continued Madame, &ldquo;a certain recommendation was
      addressed to you, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere&rsquo;s fixed and wild gaze showed how complete her forgetfulness or
      ignorance was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen recommended you,&rdquo; continued Madame, &ldquo;to conduct yourself in
      such a manner that no one could be justified in spreading any reports
      about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere darted an inquiring look towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; continued Madame, &ldquo;allow my household, which is that of the
      first princess of the blood, to set an evil example to the court; you
      would be the cause of such an example. I beg you to understand, therefore,
      in the absence of any witness of your shame&mdash;for I do not wish to
      humiliate you&mdash;that you are from this moment at perfect liberty to
      leave, and that you can return to your mother at Blois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere could not sink lower, nor could she suffer more than she had
      already suffered. Her countenance did not even change, but she remained
      kneeling with her hands clasped, like the figure of the Magdalen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shiver, which passed through her whole frame, was La Valliere&rsquo;s only
      reply. And as the victim gave no other signs of life, Madame left the
      room. And then, her very respiration suspended, and her blood almost
      congealed, as it were, in her veins, La Valliere by degrees felt that the
      pulsation of her wrists, her neck, and temples, began to throb more and
      more painfully. These pulsations, as they gradually increased, soon
      changed into a species of brain fever, and in her temporary delirium she
      saw the figures of her friends contending with her enemies, floating
      before her vision. She heard, too, mingled together in her deafened ears,
      words of menace and words of fond affection; she seemed raised out of her
      existence as though it were upon the wings of a mighty tempest, and in the
      dim horizon of the path along which her delirium hurried her, she saw the
      stone which covered her tomb upraised, and the grim, appalling texture of
      eternal night revealed to her distracted gaze. But the horror of the dream
      which possessed her senses faded away, and she was again restored to the
      habitual resignation of her character. A ray of hope penetrated her heart,
      as a ray of sunlight streams into the dungeon of some unhappy captive. Her
      mind reverted to the journey from Fontainebleau, she saw the king riding
      beside her carriage, telling her that he loved her, asking for her love in
      return, requiring her to swear, and himself to swear too, that never
      should an evening pass by, if ever a misunderstanding were to arise
      between them, without a visit, a letter, a sign of some kind, being sent,
      to replace the troubled anxiety of the evening with the calm repose of the
      night. It was the king who had suggested that, who had imposed a promise
      on her, and who had sworn to it himself. It was impossible, therefore, she
      reasoned, that the king should fail in keeping the promise which he had
      himself exacted from her, unless, indeed, Louis was a despot who enforced
      love as he enforced obedience; unless, too, the king were so indifferent
      that the first obstacle in his way was sufficient to arrest his further
      progress. The king, that kind protector, who by a word, a single word,
      could relieve her distress of mind, the king even joined her persecutors.
      Oh! his anger could not possibly last. Now that he was alone, he would be
      suffering all that she herself was a prey to. But he was not tied hand and
      foot as she was; he could act, could move about, could come to her, while
      she could do nothing but wait. And the poor girl waited and waited, with
      breathless anxiety&mdash;for she could not believe it possible that the
      king would not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now about half-past ten. He would either come to her, or write to
      her, or send some kind word by M. de Saint-Aignan. If he were to come, oh!
      how she would fly to meet him; how she would thrust aside that excess of
      delicacy which she now discovered was misunderstood; how eagerly she would
      explain: &ldquo;It is not I who do not love you&mdash;it is the fault of others
      who will not allow me to love you.&rdquo; And then it must be confessed that she
      reflected upon it, and also the more she reflected, Louis appeared to her
      to be less guilty. In fact, he was ignorant of everything. What must he
      have thought of the obstinacy with which she remained silent? Impatient
      and irritable as the king was known to be, it was extraordinary that he
      had been able to preserve his temper so long. And yet, had it been her own
      case, she undoubtedly would not have acted in such a manner; she would
      have understood&mdash;have guessed everything. Yes, but she was nothing
      but a poor simple-minded girl, and not a great and powerful monarch. Oh!
      if he would but come, if he would but come!&mdash;how eagerly she would
      forgive him for all he had just made her suffer! how much more tenderly
      she would love him because she had so cruelly suffered! And so she sat,
      with her head bent forward in eager expectation towards the door, her lips
      slightly parted, as if&mdash;and Heaven forgive her for the mental
      exclamation!&mdash;they were awaiting the kiss which the king&rsquo;s lips had
      in the morning so sweetly indicated, when he pronounced the word <i>love!</i>
      If the king did not come, at least he would write; it was a second chance;
      a chance less delightful certainly than the other, but which would show an
      affection just as strong, only more timid in its nature. Oh! how she would
      devour his letter, how eager she would be to answer it! and when the
      messenger who had brought it had left her, how she would kiss it, read it
      over and over again, press to her heart the lucky paper which would have
      brought her ease of mind, tranquillity, and perfect happiness. At all
      events, if the king did not come, if the king did not write, he could not
      do otherwise than send Saint-Aignan, or Saint-Aignan could not do
      otherwise than come of his own accord. Even if it were a third person, how
      openly she would speak to him; the royal presence would not be there to
      freeze her words upon her tongue, and then no suspicious feeling would
      remain a moment longer in the king&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything with La Valliere, heart and look, body and mind, was
      concentrated in eager expectation. She said to herself that there was an
      hour left in which to indulge hope; that until midnight struck, the king
      might come, or write or send; that at midnight only would every
      expectation vanish, every hope be lost. Whenever she heard any stir in the
      palace, the poor girl fancied she was the cause of it; whenever she heard
      any one pass in the courtyard below she imagined they were messengers of
      the king coming to her. Eleven o&rsquo;clock struck, then a quarter-past eleven;
      then half-past. The minutes dragged slowly on in this anxiety, and yet
      they seemed to pass too quickly. And now, it struck a quarter to twelve.
      Midnight&mdash;midnight was near, the last, the final hope that remained.
      With the last stroke of the clock, the last ray of light seemed to fade
      away; and with the last ray faded her final hope. And so, the king himself
      had deceived her; it was he who had been the first to fail in keeping the
      oath which he had sworn that very day; twelve hours only between his oath
      and his perjured vow; it was not long, alas! to have preserved the
      illusion. And so, not only did the king not love her, but he despised her
      whom every one ill-treated, he despised her to the extent even of
      abandoning her to the shame of an expulsion which was equivalent to having
      an ignominious sentence passed on her; and yet, it was he, the king
      himself, who was the first cause of this ignominy. A bitter smile, the
      only symptom of anger which during this long conflict had passed across
      the angelic face, appeared upon her lips. What, in fact, now remained on
      earth for her, after the king was lost to her? Nothing. But Heaven still
      remained, and her thoughts flew thither. She prayed that the proper course
      for her to follow might be suggested. &ldquo;It is from Heaven,&rdquo; she thought,
      &ldquo;that I expect everything; it is from Heaven I ought to expect
      everything.&rdquo; And she looked at her crucifix with a devotion full of tender
      love. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;hangs before me a Master who never forgets and
      never abandons those who neither forget nor abandon Him; it is to Him
      alone that we must sacrifice ourselves.&rdquo; And, thereupon, could any one
      have gazed into the recesses of that chamber, they would have seen the
      poor despairing girl adopt a final resolution, and determine upon one last
      plan in her mind. Then, as her knees were no longer able to support her,
      she gradually sank down upon the <i>prie-Dieu</i>, and with her head
      pressed against the wooden cross, her eyes fixed, and her respiration
      short and quick, she watched for the earliest rays of approaching
      daylight. At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning she was still in the same
      bewilderment of mind, or rather the same ecstasy of feeling. Her thoughts
      had almost ceased to hold communion with things of the world. And when she
      saw the pale violet tints of early dawn visible over the roofs of the
      palace, and vaguely revealing the outlines of the ivory crucifix which she
      held embraced, she rose from the ground with a new-born strength, kissed
      the feet of the divine martyr, descended the staircase leading from the
      room, and wrapped herself from head to foot in a mantle as she went along.
      She reached the wicket at the very moment the guard of the musketeers
      opened the gate to admit the first relief-guard belonging to one of the
      Swiss regiments. And then, gliding behind the soldiers, she reached the
      street before the officer in command of the patrol had even thought of
      asking who the young girl was who was making her escape from the palace at
      so early an hour.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVI. The Flight.
    </h2>
    <p>
      La Valliere followed the patrol as it left the courtyard. The patrol bent
      its steps towards the right, by the Rue St. Honore, and mechanically La
      Valliere turned to the left. Her resolution was taken&mdash;her
      determination fixed; she wished to betake herself to the convent of the
      Carmelites at Chaillot, the superior of which enjoyed a reputation for
      severity which made the worldly-minded people of the court tremble. La
      Valliere had never seen Paris, she had never gone out on foot, and so
      would have been unable to find her way even had she been in a calmer frame
      of mind than was then the case; and this may explain why she ascended,
      instead of descending, the Rue St. Honore. Her only thought was to get
      away from the Palais Royal, and this she was doing; she had heard it said
      that Chaillot looked out upon the Seine, and she accordingly directed her
      steps towards the Seine. She took the Rue de Coq, and not being able to
      cross the Louvre, bore towards the church of Saint Germain l&rsquo;Auxerrois,
      proceeding along the site of the colonnade which was subsequently built
      there by Perrault. In a very short time she reached the quays. Her steps
      were rapid and agitated; she scarcely felt the weakness which reminded her
      of having sprained her foot when very young, and which obliged her to limp
      slightly. At any other hour in the day her countenance would have awakened
      the suspicions of the least clear-sighted, attracted the attention of the
      most indifferent. But at half-past two in the morning, the streets of
      Paris are almost, if not quite, deserted, and scarcely is any one to be
      seen but the hard-working artisan on his way to earn his daily bread or
      the roistering idlers of the streets, who are returning to their homes
      after a night of riot and debauchery; for the former the day was
      beginning, and for the latter it was just closing. La Valliere was afraid
      of both faces, in which her ignorance of Parisian types did not permit her
      to distinguish the type of probity from that of dishonesty. The appearance
      of misery alarmed her, and all she met seemed either vile or miserable.
      Her dress, which was the same she had worn during the previous evening,
      was elegant even in its careless disorder; for it was the one in which she
      had presented herself to the queen-mother; and, moreover, when she drew
      aside the mantle which covered her face, in order to enable her to see the
      way she was going, her pallor and her beautiful eyes spoke an unknown
      language to the men she met, and, unconsciously, the poor fugitive seemed
      to invite the brutal remarks of the one class, or to appeal to the
      compassion of the other. La Valliere still walked on in the same way,
      breathless and hurried, until she reached the top of the Place de Greve.
      She stopped from time to time, placed her hand upon her heart, leaned
      against a wall until she could breathe freely again, and then continued on
      her course more rapidly than before. On reaching the Place de Greve La
      Valliere suddenly came upon a group of three drunken men, reeling and
      staggering along, who were just leaving a boat which they had made fast to
      the quay; the boat was freighted with wines, and it was apparent that they
      had done ample justice to the merchandise. They were celebrating their
      convivial exploits in three different keys, when suddenly, as they reached
      the end of the railing leading down to the quay, they found an obstacle in
      their path, in the shape of this young girl. La Valliere stopped; while
      they, on their part, at the appearance of the young girl dressed in court
      costume, also halted, and seizing each other by the hand, they surrounded
      La Valliere, singing,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! all ye weary wights, who mope alone, Come drink, and sing and laugh,
      round Venus&rsquo; throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere at once understood that the men were insulting her, and wished
      to prevent her passing; she tried to do so several times, but her efforts
      were useless. Her limbs failed her; she felt she was on the point of
      falling, and uttered a cry of terror. At the same moment the circle which
      surrounded her was suddenly broken through in a most violent manner. One
      of her insulters was knocked to the left, another fell rolling over and
      over to the right, close to the water&rsquo;s edge, while the third could hardly
      keep his feet. An officer of the musketeers stood face to face with the
      young girl, with threatening brow and hand raised to carry out his threat.
      The drunken fellows, at sight of the uniform, made their escape with what
      speed their staggering limbs could lend them, all the more eagerly for the
      proof of strength which the wearer of the uniform had just afforded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; exclaimed the musketeer, &ldquo;that it can be Mademoiselle de
      la Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere, bewildered by what had just happened, and confounded by
      hearing her name pronounced, looked up and recognized D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Oh, M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan! it is indeed I;&rdquo; and at the same moment she seized his arm.
      &ldquo;You will protect me, will you not?&rdquo; she added, in a tone of entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly I will protect you; but, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, where are you
      going at this hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Chaillot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to Chaillot by way of La Rapee! why, mademoiselle, you are
      turning your back upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, monsieur, be kind enough to put me in the right way, and to
      go with me a short distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most willingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how does it happen that I have found you here? By what merciful
      intervention were you sent to my assistance? I almost seem to be dreaming,
      or to be losing my senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happened to be here, mademoiselle, because I have a house in the Place
      de Greve, at the sign of the Notre-Dame, the rent of which I went to
      receive yesterday, and where I, in fact, passed the night. And I also
      wished to be at the palace early, for the purposes of inspecting my
      posts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what <i>I</i> was doing,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan to himself; &ldquo;but what
      is <i>she</i> doing, and why is she going to Chaillot at such an hour?&rdquo;
       And he offered her his arm, which she took, and began to walk with
      increased precipitation, which ill-concealed, however, her weakness.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan perceived it, and proposed to La Valliere that she should take
      a little rest, which she refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ignorant, perhaps, where Chaillot is?&rdquo; inquired D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That matters very little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at least a league.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can walk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan did not reply; he could tell, merely by the tone of a voice,
      when a resolution was real or not. He rather bore along rather than
      accompanied La Valliere, until they perceived the elevated ground of
      Chaillot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What house are you going to, mademoiselle?&rdquo; inquired D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Carmelites, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Carmelites?&rdquo; repeated D&rsquo;Artagnan, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and since Heaven has directed you towards me to give me your support
      on my road, accept both my thanks and my adieux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Carmelites! Your adieux! Are you going to become a nun?&rdquo; exclaimed
      D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you!!!&rdquo; There was in this &ldquo;you,&rdquo; which we have marked by three
      notes of exclamation in order to render it as expressive as possible,&mdash;there
      was, we repeat, in this &ldquo;you&rdquo; a complete poem; it recalled to La Valliere
      her old recollections of Blois, and her new recollections of
      Fontainebleau; it said to her, &ldquo;<i>You</i>, who might be happy with Raoul;
      <i>you</i>, who might be powerful with Louis; <i>you</i> about to become a
      nun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to devote myself to the service of
      Heaven; and to renounce the world entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you not mistaken with regard to your vocation,&mdash;are you not
      mistaken in supposing it to be the will of Heaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, since Heaven has been pleased to throw you in my way. Had it not been
      for you, I should certainly have sunk from fatigue on the road, and since
      Heaven, I repeat, has thrown you in my way, it is because it has willed
      that I should carry out my intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, doubtingly, &ldquo;that is a rather subtle distinction, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever it may be,&rdquo; returned the young girl, &ldquo;I have acquainted you with
      the steps I have taken, and with my fixed resolution. And, now, I have one
      last favor to ask of you, even while I return you my thanks. The king is
      entirely ignorant of my flight from the Palais Royal, and is ignorant also
      of what I am about to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king ignorant, you say!&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Take care,
      mademoiselle; you are not aware of what you are doing. No one ought to do
      anything with which the king is unacquainted, especially those who belong
      to the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I no longer belong to the court, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan looked at the young girl with increasing astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be uneasy, monsieur,&rdquo; she continued: &ldquo;I have well calculated
      everything; and were it not so, it would now be too late to reconsider my
      resolution,&mdash;all is decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mademoiselle, what do you wish me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of that sympathy which misfortune inspires, by your generous
      feeling, and by your honor as a gentleman, I entreat you to promise me one
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear to me, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, that you will not tell the king that
      you have seen me, and that I am at the Carmelites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not swear that,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know the king, I know you, I know myself even, nay, the whole
      human race, too well; no, no, I will not swear that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; cried La Valliere, with an energy of which one would
      hardly have thought her capable, &ldquo;instead of the blessing which I should
      have implored for you until my dying day, I will invoke a curse, for you
      are rendering me the most miserable creature that ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We have already observed that D&rsquo;Artagnan could easily recognize the
      accents of truth and sincerity, and he could not resist this last appeal.
      He saw by her face how bitterly she suffered from a feeling of
      degradation, he remarked her trembling limbs, how her whole slight and
      delicate frame was violently agitated by some internal struggle, and
      clearly perceived that resistance might be fatal. &ldquo;I will do as you wish,
      then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Be satisfied, mademoiselle, I will say nothing to the
      king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! thanks, thanks,&rdquo; exclaimed La Valliere, &ldquo;you are the most generous
      man breathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in her extreme delight she seized hold of D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s hands and
      pressed them between her own. D&rsquo;Artagnan, who felt himself quite overcome,
      said: &ldquo;This is touching, upon my word; she begins where others leave off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And La Valliere, who, in the bitterness of her distress, had sunk upon the
      ground, rose and walked towards the convent of the Carmelites, which could
      now, in the dawning light, be perceived just before them. D&rsquo;Artagnan
      followed her at a distance. The entrance-door was half-open; she glided in
      like a shadow, and thanking D&rsquo;Artagnan by a parting gesture, disappeared
      from his sight. When D&rsquo;Artagnan found himself quite alone, he reflected
      very profoundly upon what had just taken place. &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;this looks very much like what is called a false position. To keep such a
      secret as that, is to keep a burning coal in one&rsquo;s breeches-pocket, and
      trust that it may not burn the stuff. And yet, not to keep it when I have
      sworn to do so is dishonorable. It generally happens that some bright idea
      or other occurs to me as I am going along; but I am very much mistaken if
      I shall not, now, have to go a long way in order to find the solution of
      this affair. Yes, but which way to go? Oh! towards Paris, of course; that
      is the best way, after all. Only one must make haste, and in order to make
      haste four legs are better than two, and I, unhappily, only have two. &lsquo;A
      horse, a horse,&rsquo; as I heard them say at the theatre in London, &lsquo;my kingdom
      for a horse!&rsquo; And now I think of it, it need not cost me so much as that,
      for at the Barriere de la Conference there is a guard of musketeers, and
      instead of the one horse I need, I shall find ten there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, in pursuance of this resolution, which he adopted with his usual
      rapidity, D&rsquo;Artagnan immediately turned his back upon the heights of
      Chaillot, reached the guard-house, took the fastest horse he could find
      there, and was at the palace in less than ten minutes. It was striking
      five as he reached the Palais Royal. The king, he was told, had gone to
      bed at his usual hour, having been long engaged with M. Colbert, and, in
      all probability, was still sound asleep. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;she
      spoke the truth; the king is ignorant of everything; if he only knew
      one-half of what has happened, the Palais Royal by this time would be
      turned upside down.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5"

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVII. Showing How Louis, on His Part, Had Passed the Time from
      Ten to Half-Past Twelve at Night.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the king left the apartments of the maids of honor, he found Colbert
      awaiting him to take directions for the next day&rsquo;s ceremony, as the king
      was then to receive the Dutch and Spanish ambassadors. Louis XIV. had
      serious causes of dissatisfaction with the Dutch; the States had already
      been guilty of many mean shifts and evasions with France, and without
      perceiving or without caring about the chances of a rupture, they again
      abandoned the alliance with his Most Christian Majesty, for the purpose of
      entering into all kinds of plots with Spain. Louis XIV. at his accession,
      that is to say, at the death of Cardinal Mazarin, had found this political
      question roughly sketched out; the solution was difficult for a young man,
      but as, at that time, the king represented the whole nation, anything that
      the head resolved upon, the body would be found ready to carry out. Any
      sudden impulse of anger, the reaction of young hot blood upon the brain,
      would be quite sufficient to change an old form of policy and create
      another system altogether. The part that diplomatists had to play in those
      days was that of arranging among themselves the different <i>coups-d&rsquo;etat</i>
      which their sovereign masters might wish to effect. Louis was not in that
      calm frame of mind which was necessary to enable him to determine on a
      wise course of policy. Still much agitated from the quarrel he had just
      had with La Valliere, he walked hastily into his cabinet, dimly desirous
      of finding an opportunity of producing an explosion after he had
      controlled himself for so long a time. Colbert, as he saw the king enter,
      knew the position of affairs at a glance, understood the king&rsquo;s
      intentions, and resolved therefore to maneuver a little. When Louis
      requested to be informed what it would be necessary to say on the morrow,
      Colbert began by expressing his surprise that his majesty had not been
      properly informed by M. Fouquet. &ldquo;M. Fouquet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is perfectly
      acquainted with the whole of this Dutch affair&mdash;he received the
      dispatches himself direct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, who was accustomed to hear M. Colbert speak in not
      over-scrupulous terms of M. Fouquet, allowed this remark to pass
      unanswered, and merely listened. Colbert noticed the effect it had
      produced, and hastened to back out, saying that M. Fouquet was not on all
      occasions as blamable as at the first glance might seem to be the case,
      inasmuch as at that moment he was greatly occupied. The king looked up.
      &ldquo;What do you allude to?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, men are but men, and M. Fouquet has his defects as well as his
      great qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! defects, who is without them, M. Colbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, hardly,&rdquo; said Colbert, boldly; for he knew how to convey a
      good deal of flattery in a light amount of blame, like the arrow which
      cleaves the air notwithstanding its weight, thanks to the light feathers
      which bear it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled. &ldquo;What defect has M. Fouquet, then?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still the same, sire; it is said he is in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love! with whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite sure, sire; I have very little to do with matters of
      gallantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events you know, since you speak of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard a name mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot now remember whose, but I think it is one of Madame&rsquo;s maids of
      honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king started. &ldquo;You know more than you like to say, M. Colbert,&rdquo; he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, no, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, Madame&rsquo;s maids of honor are all known, and in mentioning
      their names to you, you will perhaps recollect the one you allude to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be useless, sire. Whenever the name of any lady who runs the
      risk of being compromised is concerned, my memory is like a coffer of
      bronze, the key of which I have lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dark cloud seemed to pass over the mind as well as across the face of
      the king; then, wishing to appear as if he were perfect master of himself
      and his feelings, he said, &ldquo;And now for the affair concerning Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, sire, at what hour will your majesty receive the
      ambassadors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is too late&mdash;say nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be too early, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For friends, that would be a matter of no importance; one does what one
      likes with one&rsquo;s friends; but for one&rsquo;s enemies, in that case nothing
      could be better than if they <i>were</i> to feel hurt. I should not be
      sorry, I confess, to have to finish altogether with these marsh-birds, who
      annoy me with their cries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be precisely as your majesty desires. At nine o&rsquo;clock, therefore&mdash;I
      will give the necessary orders. Is it to be a formal audience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I wish to have an explanation with them, and not to embitter matters,
      as is always the case when many persons are present, but, at the same
      time, I wish to clear up everything with them, in order not to have to
      begin over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty will inform me of the persons whom you wish to be present at
      the reception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will draw out a list. Let us speak of the ambassadors; what do they
      want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allies with Spain, they gain nothing; allies with France, they lose
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allied with Spain, they see themselves bounded and protected by the
      possessions of their allies; they cannot touch them, however anxious they
      may be to do so. From Antwerp to Rotterdam is but a step, and that by the
      way of the Scheldt and the Meuse. If they wish to make a bite at the
      Spanish cake, you, sire, the son-in-law of the king of Spain, could with
      your cavalry sweep the earth from your dominions to Brussels in a couple
      of days. Their design is, therefore, only to quarrel so far with you, and
      only to make you suspect Spain so far, as will be sufficient to induce you
      not to interfere with their own affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be far more simple, I should imagine,&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;to
      form a solid alliance with me, by means of which I should gain something,
      while they would gain everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so; for if, by chance, they were to have you, or France rather, as a
      boundary, your majesty is not an agreeable neighbor. Young, ardent,
      warlike, the king of France might inflict some serious mischief on
      Holland, especially if he were to get near her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perfectly understand, M. Colbert, and you have explained it very
      clearly; but be good enough to tell me the conclusion you have arrived
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty&rsquo;s own decisions are never deficient in wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will these ambassadors say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will tell your majesty that they are ardently desirous of forming an
      alliance with you, which will be a falsehood: they will tell Spain that
      the three powers ought to unite so as to check the prosperity of England,
      and that will equally be a falsehood; for at present, the natural ally of
      your majesty is England, who has ships while we have none; England, who
      can counteract Dutch influence in India; England, in fact, a monarchical
      country, to which your majesty is attached by ties of relationship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; but how would you answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should answer, sire, with the greatest possible moderation of tone,
      that the disposition of Holland does not seem friendly towards the Court
      of France; that the symptoms of public feeling among the Dutch are
      alarming as regards your majesty; that certain medals have been struck
      with insulting devices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards me?&rdquo; exclaimed the young king, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! sire, no; insulting is not the word; I was mistaken, I ought to
      have said immeasurably flattering to the Dutch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if that be so, the pride of the Dutch is a matter of indifference to
      me,&rdquo; said the king, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is right, a thousand times right. However, it is never a
      mistake in politics, your majesty knows better than myself, to exaggerate
      a little in order to obtain a concession in your own favor. If your
      majesty were to complain as if your susceptibility were offended, you
      would stand in a far higher position with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are these medals you speak of?&rdquo; inquired Louis; &ldquo;for if I allude to
      them, I ought to know what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, sire, I cannot very well tell you&mdash;some overweeningly
      conceited device&mdash;that is the sense of it; the words have little to
      do with the thing itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good! I will mention the word &lsquo;medal,&rsquo; and they can understand it if
      they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! they will understand without any difficulty. Your majesty can also
      slip in a few words about certain pamphlets which are being circulated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! Pamphlets befoul those who write them much more than those against
      whom they are written. M. Colbert, I thank you. You can leave now. Do not
      forget the hour I have fixed, and be there yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I await your majesty&rsquo;s list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; returned the king; and he began to meditate; he had not thought of
      the list in the least. The clock struck half-past eleven. The king&rsquo;s face
      revealed a violent conflict between pride and love. The political
      conversation had dispelled a good deal of the irritation which Louis had
      felt, and La Valliere&rsquo;s pale, worn features, in his imagination, spoke a
      very different language from that of the Dutch medals, or the Batavian
      pamphlets. He sat for ten minutes debating within himself whether he
      should or should not return to La Valliere; but Colbert having with some
      urgency respectfully requested that the list might be furnished him, the
      king was ashamed to be thinking of mere matters of affection where
      important state affairs required his attention. He therefore dictated: the
      queen-mother, the queen, Madame, Madame de Motteville, Madame de
      Chatillon, Madame de Navailles; and, for the men, M. le Prince, M. de
      Gramont, M. de Manicamp, M. de Saint-Aignan, and the officers on duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ministers?&rdquo; asked Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of course, and the secretaries also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I will leave at once in order to get everything prepared; the
      orders will be at the different residences to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather to-day,&rdquo; replied Louis mournfully, as the clock struck twelve.
      It was the very hour when poor La Valliere was almost dying from anguish
      and bitter suffering. The king&rsquo;s attendants entered, it being the hour of
      his retirement to his chamber; the queen, indeed, had been waiting for
      more than an hour. Louis accordingly retreated to his bedroom with a sigh;
      but, as he sighed, he congratulated himself on his courage, and applauded
      himself for having been as firm in love as in affairs of state.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVIII. The Ambassadors.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had, with very few exceptions, learned almost all of the
      particulars of what we have just been relating; for among his friends he
      reckoned all the useful, serviceable people in the royal household,&mdash;officious
      attendants who were proud of being recognized by the captain of the
      musketeers, for the captain&rsquo;s influence was very great; and then, in
      addition to any ambitious views they may have imagined he could promote,
      they were proud of being regarded as worth being spoken to by a man as
      brave as D&rsquo;Artagnan. In this manner D&rsquo;Artagnan learned every morning what
      he had not been able either to see or to ascertain the night before, from
      the simple fact of his not being ubiquitous; so that, with the information
      he had been able by his own means to pick up during the day, and with what
      he had gathered from others, he succeeded in making up a bundle of
      weapons, which he was in the prudent habit of using only when occasion
      required. In this way, D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s two eyes rendered him the same service
      as the hundred eyes of Argus. Political secrets, bedside revelations,
      hints or scraps of conversation dropped by the courtiers on the threshold
      of the royal ante-chamber, in this way D&rsquo;Artagnan managed to ascertain,
      and to store away everything in the vast and impenetrable mausoleum of his
      memory, by the side of those royal secrets so dearly bought and faithfully
      preserved. He therefore knew of the king&rsquo;s interview with Colbert, and of
      the appointment made for the ambassadors in the morning, and,
      consequently, that the question of the medals would be brought up for
      debate; and, while he was arranging and constructing the conversation upon
      a few chance words which had reached his ears, he returned to his post in
      the royal apartments, so as to be there at the very moment the king awoke.
      It happened that the king rose very early,&mdash;proving thereby that he,
      too, on his side, had slept but indifferently. Towards seven o&rsquo;clock, he
      half-opened his door very gently. D&rsquo;Artagnan was at his post. His majesty
      was pale, and seemed wearied; he had not, moreover, quite finished
      dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for M. de Saint-Aignan,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan was probably awaiting a summons, for the messenger, when he
      reached his apartment, found him already dressed. Saint-Aignan hastened to
      the king in obedience to the summons. A moment afterwards the king and
      Saint-Aignan passed by together&mdash;the king walking first. D&rsquo;Artagnan
      went to the window which looked out upon the courtyard; he had no need to
      put himself to the trouble of watching in what direction the king went,
      for he had no difficulty in guessing beforehand where his majesty was
      going. The king, in fact, bent his steps towards the apartments of the
      maids of honor,&mdash;a circumstance which in no way astonished
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, for he more than suspected, although La Valliere had not
      breathed a syllable on the subject, that the king had some kind of
      reparation to make. Saint-Aignan followed him as he had done the previous
      evening, rather less uneasy in his mind, though still slightly agitated,
      for he fervently trusted that at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning there might
      be only himself and the king awake amongst the august guests at the
      palace. D&rsquo;Artagnan stood at the window, careless and perfectly calm in his
      manner. One could almost have sworn that he noticed nothing, and was
      utterly ignorant who were these two hunters after adventures, passing like
      shadows across the courtyard, wrapped up in their cloaks. And yet, all the
      while that D&rsquo;Artagnan appeared not to be looking at them at all, he did
      not for one moment lose sight of them, and while he whistled that old
      march of the musketeers, which he rarely recalled except under great
      emergencies, he conjectured and prophesied how terrible would be the storm
      which would be raised on the king&rsquo;s return. In fact, when the king entered
      La Valliere&rsquo;s apartment and found the room empty and the bed untouched, he
      began to be alarmed, and called out to Montalais, who immediately answered
      the summons; but her astonishment was equal to the king&rsquo;s. All that she
      could tell his majesty was, that she had fancied she had heard La
      Valliere&rsquo;s weeping during a portion of the night, but, knowing that his
      majesty had paid her a visit, she had not dared to inquire what was the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; inquired the king, &ldquo;where do you suppose she is gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Montalais, &ldquo;Louise is of a very sentimental disposition,
      and as I have often seen her rise at daybreak in order to go out into the
      garden, she may, perhaps, be there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This appeared probable, and the king immediately ran down the staircase in
      search of the fugitive. D&rsquo;Artagnan saw him grow very pale, and talking in
      an excited manner with his companion, as he went towards the gardens;
      Saint-Aignan following him, out of breath. D&rsquo;Artagnan did not stir from
      the window, but went on whistling, looking as if he saw nothing, yet
      seeing everything. &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he murmured, when the king disappeared,
      &ldquo;his majesty&rsquo;s passion is stronger than I thought; he is now doing, I
      think, what he never did for Mademoiselle de Mancini.&rdquo; <a
      href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour the king again appeared: he had looked everywhere,
      was completely out of breath, and, as a matter of course, had not
      discovered anything. Saint-Aignan, who still followed him, was fanning
      himself with his hat, and in a gasping voice, asking for information about
      La Valliere from such of the servants as were about, in fact from every
      one he met. Among others he came across Manicamp, who had arrived from
      Fontainebleau by easy stages; for whilst others had performed the journey
      in six hours, he had taken four and twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&rdquo; Saint-Aignan asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Manicamp, dreamy and absent as usual, answered, thinking that
      some one was asking him about De Guiche, &ldquo;Thank you, the comte is a little
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he continued on his way until he reached the ante-chamber where
      D&rsquo;Artagnan was, whom he asked to explain how it was that the king looked,
      as he thought, so bewildered; to which D&rsquo;Artagnan replied that he was
      quite mistaken, that the king, on the contrary, was as lively and merry as
      he could possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of all this, eight o&rsquo;clock struck. It was usual for the king
      to take his breakfast at this hour, for the code of etiquette prescribed
      that the king should always be hungry at eight o&rsquo;clock. His breakfast was
      laid upon a small table in his bedroom, and he ate very fast.
      Saint-Aignan, of whom he would not lose sight, waited on the king. He then
      disposed of several military audiences, during which he dispatched
      Saint-Aignan to see what he could find out. Then, still occupied, full of
      anxiety, still watching Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s return, who had sent out the
      servants in every direction, to make inquires, and who had also gone
      himself, the hour of nine struck, and the king forthwith passed into his
      large cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock was striking nine the ambassadors entered, and as it
      finished, the two queens and Madame made their appearance. There were
      three ambassadors from Holland, and two from Spain. The king glanced at
      them, and then bowed; and, at the same moment, Saint-Aignan entered,&mdash;an
      entrance which the king regarded as far more important, in a different
      sense, however, than that of ambassadors, however numerous they might be,
      and from whatever country they came; and so, setting everything aside, the
      king made a sign of interrogation to Saint-Aignan, which the latter
      answered by a most decisive negative. The king almost entirely lost his
      courage; but as the queens, the members of the nobility who were present,
      and the ambassadors, had their eyes fixed upon him, he overcame his
      emotion by a violent effort, and invited the latter to speak. Whereupon
      one of the Spanish deputies made a long oration, in which he boasted the
      advantages which the Spanish alliance would offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king interrupted him, saying, &ldquo;Monsieur, I trust that whatever is best
      for France must be exceedingly advantageous for Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark, and particularly the peremptory tone in which it was
      pronounced, made the ambassadors pale, and brought the color into the
      cheeks of the two queens, who, being Spanish, felt wounded in their pride
      of relationship and nationality by this reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dutch ambassador then began to address himself to the king, and
      complained of the injurious suspicions which the king exhibited against
      the government of his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king interrupted him, saying, &ldquo;It is very singular, monsieur, that you
      should come with any complaint, when it is I rather who have reason to be
      dissatisfied; and yet, you see, I do not complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complain, sire, and in what respect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled bitterly. &ldquo;Will you blame me, monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I
      should happen to entertain suspicions against a government which
      authorizes and protects international impertinence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; resumed the king, exciting himself by a recollection of his
      own personal annoyance, rather than from political grounds, &ldquo;that Holland
      is a land of refuge for all who hate me, and especially for all who malign
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish for proofs, perhaps? Very good; they can be had easily enough.
      Whence proceed all those vile and insolent pamphlets which represent me as
      a monarch without glory and without authority? your printing-presses groan
      under their number. If my secretaries were here, I would mention the
      titles of the works as well as the names of the printers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied the ambassador, &ldquo;a pamphlet can hardly be regarded as the
      work of a whole nation. Is it just, is it reasonable, that a great and
      powerful monarch like your majesty should render a whole nation
      responsible for the crime of a few madmen, who are, perhaps, only
      scribbling in a garret for a few sous to buy bread for their family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be the case, I admit. But when the mint itself, at Amsterdam,
      strikes off medals which reflect disgrace upon me, is that also the crime
      of a few madmen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medals!&rdquo; stammered out the ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medals,&rdquo; repeated the king, looking at Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; the ambassador ventured, &ldquo;should be quite sure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king still looked at Colbert; but Colbert appeared not to understand
      him, and maintained an unbroken silence, notwithstanding the king&rsquo;s
      repeated hints. D&rsquo;Artagnan then approached the king, and taking a piece of
      money out of his pocket, he placed it in the king&rsquo;s hands, saying, &ldquo;<i>This</i>
      is the medal your majesty alludes to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king looked at it, and with a look which, ever since he had become his
      own master, was ever piercing as the eagle&rsquo;s, observed an insulting device
      representing Holland arresting the progress of the sun, with this
      inscription: &ldquo;<i>In conspectu meo stetit sol</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my presence the sun stands still,&rdquo; exclaimed the king, furiously. &ldquo;Ah!
      you will hardly deny it now, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the sun,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;is this,&rdquo; as he pointed to the panels of
      the cabinet, where the sun was brilliantly represented in every direction,
      with this motto, &ldquo;<i>Nec pluribus impar</i>.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-7"
       name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis&rsquo;s anger, increased by the bitterness of his own personal sufferings,
      hardly required this additional circumstance to foment it. Every one saw,
      from the kindling passion in the king&rsquo;s eyes, that an explosion was
      imminent. A look from Colbert kept postponed the bursting of the storm.
      The ambassador ventured to frame excuses by saying that the vanity of
      nations was a matter of little consequence; that Holland was proud that,
      with such limited resources, she had maintained her rank as a great
      nation, even against powerful monarchs, and that if a little smoke had
      intoxicated his countrymen, the king would be kindly disposed, and would
      even excuse this intoxication. The king seemed as if he would be glad of
      some suggestion; he looked at Colbert, who remained impassible; then at
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, who simply shrugged his shoulders, a movement which was like
      the opening of the flood-gates, whereby the king&rsquo;s anger, which he had
      restrained for so long a period, now burst forth. As no one knew what
      direction his anger might take, all preserved a dead silence. The second
      ambassador took advantage of it to begin his excuses also. While he was
      speaking, and while the king, who had again gradually returned to his own
      personal reflections, was automatically listening to the voice, full of
      nervous anxiety, with the air of an absent man listening to the murmuring
      of a cascade, D&rsquo;Artagnan, on whose left hand Saint-Aignan was standing,
      approached the latter, and, in a voice which was loud enough to reach the
      king&rsquo;s ears, said: &ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news?&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About La Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king started, and advanced his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to La Valliere?&rdquo; inquired Saint-Aignan, in a tone which
      can easily be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! poor girl! she is going to take the veil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The veil!&rdquo; exclaimed Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The veil!&rdquo; cried the king, in the midst of the ambassador&rsquo;s discourse;
      but then, mindful of the rules of etiquette, he mastered himself, still
      listening, however, with rapt attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What order?&rdquo; inquired Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Carmelites of Chaillot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the deuce told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen her, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I even went with her to the Carmelites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king did not lose a syllable of this conversation; and again he could
      hardly control his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was the cause of her flight?&rdquo; inquired Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the poor girl was driven away from the court yesterday,&rdquo; replied
      D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner said this, than the king, with an authoritative gesture,
      said to the ambassador, &ldquo;Enough, monsieur, enough.&rdquo; Then, advancing
      towards the captain, he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says Mademoiselle de la Valliere is going to take the religious
      vows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; answered the favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true what you say?&rdquo; said the king, turning towards the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true as truth itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king clenched his hands, and turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have something further to add, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing more, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You added that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had been driven away from the
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true, also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ascertain for yourself, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed D&rsquo;Artagnan, like a man who is declining to say anything
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king almost bounded from his seat, regardless of ambassadors,
      ministers, courtiers, queens, and politics. The queen-mother rose; she had
      heard everything, or, if she had not heard everything, she had guessed it.
      Madame, almost fainting from anger and fear, endeavored to rise as the
      queen-mother had done; but she sank down again upon her chair, which by an
      instinctive movement she made roll back a few paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;the audience is over; I will communicate my
      answer, or rather my will, to Spain and to Holland;&rdquo; and with a proud,
      imperious gesture, he dismissed the ambassadors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, my son,&rdquo; said the queen-mother, indignantly, &ldquo;you are hardly
      master of yourself, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame,&rdquo; returned the young lion, with a terrible gesture, &ldquo;if I am
      not master of myself, I will be, I promise you, of those who do me a
      deadly injury; come with me, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, come.&rdquo; And he quitted the room
      in the midst of general stupefaction and dismay. The king hastily
      descended the staircase, and was about to cross the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;your majesty mistakes the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am going to the stables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is useless, sire, for I have horses ready for your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s only answer was a look, but this look promised more than the
      ambition of three D&rsquo;Artagnans could have dared to hope.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIX. Chaillot.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although they had not been summoned, Manicamp and Malicorne had followed
      the king and D&rsquo;Artagnan. They were both exceedingly intelligent men;
      except that Malicorne was too precipitate, owing to ambition, while
      Manicamp was frequently too tardy, owing to indolence. On this occasion,
      however, they arrived at precisely the proper moment. Five horses were in
      readiness. Two were seized upon by the king and D&rsquo;Artagnan, two others by
      Manicamp and Malicorne, while a groom belonging to the stables mounted the
      fifth. The cavalcade set off at a gallop. D&rsquo;Artagnan had been very careful
      in his selection of the horses; they were the very animals for distressed
      lovers&mdash;horses which did not simply run, but flew. Within ten minutes
      after their departure, the cavalcade, amidst a cloud of dust, arrived at
      Chaillot. The king literally threw himself off his horse; but
      notwithstanding the rapidity with which he accomplished this maneuver, he
      found D&rsquo;Artagnan already holding his stirrup. With a sign of
      acknowledgement to the musketeer, he threw the bridle to the groom, and
      darted into the vestibule, violently pushed open the door, and entered the
      reception-room. Manicamp, Malicorne, and the groom remained outside,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan alone following him. When he entered the reception-room, the
      first object which met his gaze was Louise herself, not simply on her
      knees, but lying at the foot of a large stone crucifix. The young girl was
      stretched upon the damp flag-stones, scarcely visible in the gloom of the
      apartment, which was lighted only by means of a narrow window, protected
      by bars and completely shaded by creeping plants. When the king saw her in
      this state, he thought she was dead, and uttered a loud cry, which made
      D&rsquo;Artagnan hurry into the room. The king had already passed one of his
      arms round her body, and D&rsquo;Artagnan assisted him in raising the poor girl,
      whom the torpor of death seemed already to have taken possession of.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan seized hold of the alarm-bell and rang with all his might. The
      Carmelite sisters immediately hastened at the summons, and uttered loud
      exclamations of alarm and indignation at the sight of the two men holding
      a woman in their arms. The superior also hurried to the scene of action,
      but far more a creature of the world than any of the female members of the
      court, notwithstanding her austerity of manners, she recognized the king
      at the first glance, by the respect which those present exhibited for him,
      as well as by the imperious and authoritative way in which he had thrown
      the whole establishment into confusion. As soon as she saw the king, she
      retired to her own apartments, in order to avoid compromising her dignity.
      But by one of the nuns she sent various cordials, Hungary water, etc.,
      etc., and ordered that all the doors should immediately be closed, a
      command which was just in time, for the king&rsquo;s distress was fast becoming
      of a most clamorous and despairing character. He had almost decided to
      send for his own physician, when La Valliere exhibited signs of returning
      animation. The first object which met her gaze, as she opened her eyes,
      was the king at her feet; in all probability she did not recognize him,
      for she uttered a deep sigh full of anguish and distress. Louis fixed his
      eyes devouringly upon her face; and when, in the course of a few moments,
      she recognized Louis, she endeavored to tear herself from his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heavens!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;is not the sacrifice yet made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, &ldquo;and it shall <i>not</i> be made, I swear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her weakness and utter despair, she rose from the ground,
      saying, &ldquo;It must be made, however; it must be; so do not stay me in my
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you to sacrifice yourself! I! never, never!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I may as well go now. As soon as they begin
      to speak, we may as well prevent there being any listeners.&rdquo; And he
      quitted the room, leaving the lovers alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; continued La Valliere, &ldquo;not another word, I implore you. Do not
      destroy the only future I can hope for&mdash;my salvation; do not destroy
      the glory and brightness of your own future for a mere caprice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A caprice?&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire! it is now, only, that I can see clearly into your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Louise, what mean you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An inexplicable impulse, foolish and unreasonable in its nature, may
      ephemerally appear to offer a sufficient excuse for your conduct; but
      there are duties imposed upon you which are incompatible with your regard
      for a poor girl such as I am. So, forget me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already done so, once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather would I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot love one whose peace of mind you hold so lightly, and whom you
      so cruelly abandoned, last night, to the bitterness of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you mean? Explain yourself, Louise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you ask me yesterday morning? To love you. What did you promise
      me in return? Never to let midnight pass without offering me an
      opportunity of reconciliation, if, by any chance, your anger should be
      roused against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! forgive me, Louise, forgive me! I was mad from jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealousy is a sentiment unworthy of a king&mdash;a man. You may become
      jealous again, and will end by killing me. Be merciful, then, and leave me
      now to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another word, mademoiselle, in that strain, and you will see me expire at
      your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sire, I am better acquainted with my own demerits; and believe
      me, that to sacrifice yourself for one whom all despise, would be
      needless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the names of those you have cause to complain of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no complaints, sire, to prefer against any one; no one but myself
      to accuse. Farewell, sire; you are compromising yourself in speaking to me
      in such a manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! be careful, Louise, in what you say; for you are reducing me to the
      darkness of despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, sire, leave me at least the protection of Heaven, I implore
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; Heaven itself shall not tear you from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me, then,&rdquo; cried the poor girl, &ldquo;from those determined and pitiless
      enemies who are thirsting to annihilate my life and honor too. If you have
      courage enough to love me, show at least that you have power enough to
      defend me. But no; she whom you say you love, others insult and mock, and
      drive shamelessly away.&rdquo; And the gentle-hearted girl, forced, by her own
      bitter distress to accuse others, wrung her hands in an uncontrollable
      agony of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been driven away!&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;This is the second time
      I have heard that said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been driven away with shame and ignominy, sire. You see, then,
      that I have no other protector but Heaven, no consolation but prayer, and
      this cloister is my only refuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My palace, my whole court, shall be your park of peace. Oh! fear nothing
      further now, Louise; those&mdash;be they men or women&mdash;who yesterday
      drove you away, shall to-morrow tremble before you&mdash;to-morrow, do I
      say? nay, this very day I have already shown my displeasure&mdash;have
      already threatened. It is in my power, even now, to hurl the thunderbolt I
      have hitherto withheld. Louise, Louise, you shall be bitterly revenged;
      tears of blood shall repay you for the tears you have shed. Give me only
      the names of your enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I show any anger, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, those upon whom your anger would be prepared to fall, would force
      you to draw back your hand upraised to punish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you do not know me,&rdquo; cried the king, exasperated. &ldquo;Rather than draw
      back, I would sacrifice my kingdom, and would abjure my family. Yes, I
      would strike until this arm had utterly destroyed all those who had
      ventured to make themselves the enemies of the gentlest and best of
      creatures.&rdquo; And, as he said these words, Louis struck his fist violently
      against the oaken wainscoting with a force which alarmed La Valliere; for
      his anger, owing to his unbounded power, had something imposing and
      threatening in it, like the lightning, which may at any time prove deadly.
      She, who thought that her own sufferings could not be surpassed, was
      overwhelmed by a suffering which revealed itself by menace and by
      violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for the last time I implore you to leave me; already do
      I feel strengthened by the calm seclusion of this asylum; and the
      protection of Heaven has reassured me; for all the pretty human meanness
      of this world are forgotten beneath the Divine protection. Once more,
      then, sire, and for the last time, I again implore you to leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess, rather,&rdquo; cried Louis, &ldquo;that you have never loved me; admit that
      my humility and my repentance are flattering to your pride, but that my
      distress affects you not; that the king of this wide realm is no longer
      regarded as a lover whose tenderness of devotion is capable of working out
      your happiness, but as a despot whose caprice has crushed your very heart
      beneath his iron heel. Do not say you are seeking Heaven, say rather you
      are fleeing from the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louise&rsquo;s heart was wrung within her, as she listened to his passionate
      utterance, which made the fever of hope course once more through her every
      vein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did you not hear me say that I have been driven away, scorned,
      despised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make you the most respected, and most adored, and the most envied
      of my whole court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove to me that you have not ceased to love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By leaving me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will prove it to you by never leaving you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you imagine, sire, that I shall allow that; do you imagine that I
      will let you come to an open rupture with every member of your family; do
      you imagine that, for my sake, you could abandon mother, wife and sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you have named them, then, at last; it is they, then, who have
      wrought this grievous injury? By the heaven above us, then, upon them
      shall my anger fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the reason why the future terrifies me, why I refuse everything,
      why I do not wish you to revenge me. Tears enough have already been shed,
      sufficient sorrow and affliction have already been occasioned. I, at
      least, will never be the cause of sorrow, or affliction, or distress to
      whomsoever it may be, for I have mourned and suffered, and wept too much
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you count <i>my</i> sufferings, <i>my</i> tears, as nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, sire, do not speak to me in that manner. I need all my
      courage to enable me to accomplish the sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise, Louise, I implore you! whatever you desire, whatever you command,
      whether vengeance or forgiveness, your slightest wish shall be obeyed, but
      do not abandon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! sire, we must part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not love me, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is false, Louise; it is false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, if I did not love you, I should let you do what you please; I
      should let you revenge me, in return for the insult which has been
      inflicted on me; I should accept the brilliant triumph to my pride which
      you propose; and yet, you cannot deny that I reject even the sweet
      compensation which your affection affords, that affection which for me is
      life itself, for I wished to die when I thought that you loved me no
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I now know, I now perceive it; you are the sweetest, best, and
      purest of women. There is no one so worthy as yourself, not alone of my
      respect and devotion, but also of the respect and devotion of all who
      surround me; and therefore no one shall be loved like yourself; no one
      shall ever possess the influence over me that you wield. You wish me to be
      calm, to forgive?&mdash;be it so, you shall find me perfectly unmoved. You
      wish to reign by gentleness and clemency?&mdash;I will be clement and
      gentle. Dictate for me the conduct you wish me to adopt, and I will obey
      blindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, no, sire; what am I, a poor girl, to dictate to so
      great a monarch as yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my life, the very spirit and principle of my being. Is it not the
      spirit that rules the body?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love me, then, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my knees, yes; with my hands upraised to you, yes; with all the
      strength and power of my being, yes; I love you so deeply, that I would
      lay down my life for you, gladly, at your merest wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, now I know you love me, I have nothing to wish for in the
      world. Give me your hand, sire; and then, farewell! I have enjoyed in this
      life all the happiness I was ever meant for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no! your happiness is not a happiness of yesterday, it is of
      to-day, of to-morrow, ever enduring. The future is yours, everything which
      is mine is yours, too. Away with these ideas of separation, away with
      these gloomy, despairing thoughts. You will live for me, as I will live
      for you, Louise.&rdquo; And he threw himself at her feet, embracing her knees
      with the wildest transports of joy and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, sire! all that is but a wild dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, a wild dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I cannot return to the court. Exiled, how can I see you again?
      Would it not be far better to bury myself in a cloister for the rest of my
      life, with the rich consolation that your affection gives me, with the
      pulses of your heart beating for me, and your latest confession of
      attachment still ringing in my ears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exiled, you!&rdquo; exclaimed Louis XIV., &ldquo;and who dares to exile, let me ask,
      when I recall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, something which is greater than and superior to the kings even&mdash;the
      world and public opinion. Reflect for a moment; you cannot love a woman
      who has been ignominiously driven away&mdash;love one whom your mother has
      stained with suspicions; one whom your sister has threatened with
      disgrace; such a woman, indeed, would be unworthy of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unworthy! one who belongs to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, precisely on that account; from the very moment she belongs to
      you, the character of your mistress renders her unworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Louise; every shade of delicacy of feeling is yours. Very
      well, you shall not be exiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! from the tone in which you speak, you have not heard Madame, that is
      very clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will appeal from her to my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, sire, you have not seen your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She, too!&mdash;my poor Louise! every one&rsquo;s hand, then, is against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, poor Louise, who was already bending beneath the fury of the
      storm, when you arrived and crushed her beneath the weight of your
      displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not, I know, be able to make either of them yield; believe me,
      the evil cannot be repaired, for I will not allow you to use violence, or
      to exercise your authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Louise, to prove to you how fondly I love you, I will do one
      thing, I will see Madame; I will make her revoke her sentence, I will
      compel her to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compel? Oh! no, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; you are right. I will bend her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louise shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will entreat her, if it be necessary,&rdquo; said Louis. &ldquo;Will you believe in
      my affection after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louise drew herself up. &ldquo;Oh, never, never shall you humiliate yourself on
      my account; sooner, a thousand times, would I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis reflected; his features assumed a dark expression. &ldquo;I will love you
      as much as you have loved; I will suffer as keenly as you have suffered;
      this shall be my expiation in your eyes. Come, mademoiselle, put aside
      these paltry considerations; let us show ourselves as great as our
      sufferings, as strong as our affection for each other.&rdquo; And, as he said
      this, he took her in his arms, and encircled her waist with both his
      hands, saying, &ldquo;My own love! my own dearest and best beloved, follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a final effort, in which she concentrated, no longer all of her
      firmness of will, for that had long since been overcome, but all her
      physical strength. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she replied, weakly, &ldquo;no! no! I should die from
      shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! you shall return like a queen. No one knows of your having left&mdash;except,
      indeed, D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has betrayed me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He promised faithfully&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised not to say anything to the king,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, putting his
      head through the half-opened door, &ldquo;and I kept my word; I was speaking to
      M. de Saint-Aignan, and it was not my fault if the king overheard me; was
      it, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;forgive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere smiled, and held out her small white hand to the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;be good enough to see if you can
      find a carriage for Mademoiselle de la Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;the carriage is waiting at the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a magic mould of forethought,&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taken a long time to find it out,&rdquo; muttered D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      notwithstanding he was flattered by the praise bestowed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere was overcome: after a little further hesitation, she allowed
      herself to be led away, half fainting, by her royal lover. But, as she was
      on the point of leaving the room, she tore herself from the king&rsquo;s grasp,
      and returned to the stone crucifix, which she kissed, saying, &ldquo;Oh, Heaven!
      it was thou who drewest me hither! thou, who has rejected me; but thy
      grace is infinite. Whenever I shall again return, forget that I have ever
      separated myself from thee, for, when I return it will be&mdash;never to
      leave thee again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king could not restrain his emotion, and D&rsquo;Artagnan, even, was
      overcome. Louis led the young girl away, lifted her into the carriage, and
      directed D&rsquo;Artagnan to seat himself beside her, while he, mounting his
      horse, spurred violently towards the Palais Royal, where, immediately on
      his arrival, he sent to request an audience of Madame.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXX. Madame.
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the manner in which the king had dismissed the ambassadors, even the
      least clear-sighted persons belonging to the court imagined war would
      ensue. The ambassadors themselves, but slightly acquainted with the king&rsquo;s
      domestic disturbances, had interpreted as directed against themselves the
      celebrated sentence: &ldquo;If I be not master of myself, I, at least, will be
      so of those who insult me.&rdquo; Happily for the destinies of France and
      Holland, Colbert had followed them out of the king&rsquo;s presence for the
      purpose of explaining matters to them; but the two queens and Madame, who
      were perfectly aware of every particular that had taken place in their
      several households, having heard the king&rsquo;s remark, so full of dark
      meaning, retired to their own apartments in no little fear and chagrin.
      Madame, especially, felt that the royal anger might fall upon her, and, as
      she was brave and exceedingly proud, instead of seeking support and
      encouragement from the queen-mother, she had returned to her own
      apartments, if not without some uneasiness, at least without any intention
      of avoiding an encounter. Anne of Austria, from time to time at frequent
      intervals, sent messages to learn if the king had returned. The silence
      which the whole palace preserved upon the matter, and upon Louise&rsquo;s
      disappearance, was indicative of a long train of misfortunes to all those
      who knew the haughty and irritable humor of the king. But Madame, unmoved
      in spite of all the flying rumors, shut herself up in her apartments, sent
      for Montalais, and, with a voice as calm as she could possibly command,
      desired her to relate all she knew about the event itself. At the moment
      that the eloquent Montalais was concluding, with all kinds of oratorical
      precautions, and was recommending, if not in actual language, at least in
      spirit, that she should show forbearance towards La Valliere, M. Malicorne
      made his appearance to beg an audience of Madame, on behalf of the king.
      Montalais&rsquo;s worthy friend bore upon his countenance all the signs of the
      very liveliest emotion. It was impossible to be mistaken; the interview
      which the king requested would be one of the most interesting chapters in
      the history of the hearts of kings and of men. Madame was disturbed by her
      brother-in-law&rsquo;s arrival; she did not expect it so soon, nor had she,
      indeed, expected any direct step on Louis&rsquo;s part. Besides, all women who
      wage war successfully by indirect means, are invariably neither very
      skillful nor very strong when it becomes a question of accepting a pitched
      battle. Madame, however, was not one who ever drew back; she had the very
      opposite defect or qualification, in whichever light it may be considered;
      she took an exaggerated view of what constituted real courage; and
      therefore the king&rsquo;s message, of which Malicorne had been the bearer, was
      regarded by her as the bugle-note proclaiming the commencement of
      hostilities. She, therefore, boldly accepted the gage of battle. Five
      minutes afterwards the king ascended the staircase. His color was
      heightened from having ridden hard. His dusty and disordered clothes
      formed a singular contrast with the fresh and perfectly arranged toilette
      of Madame, who, notwithstanding the rouge on her cheeks, turned pale as
      Louis entered the room. Louis lost no time in approaching the object of
      his visit; he sat down, and Montalais disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you are aware that Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere fled from her own room this morning, and that she has retired to
      a cloister, overwhelmed by grief and despair.&rdquo; As he pronounced these
      words, the king&rsquo;s voice was singularly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is the first to inform me of it,&rdquo; replied Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought that you might have learned it this morning, during
      the reception of the ambassadors,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your emotion, sire, I imagined that something extraordinary had
      happened, but without knowing what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, with his usual frankness, went straight to the point. &ldquo;Why did
      you send Mademoiselle de la Valliere away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I had reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct,&rdquo; she replied,
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king became crimson, and his eyes kindled with a fire which it
      required all Madame&rsquo;s courage to support. He mastered his anger, however,
      and continued: &ldquo;A stronger reason than that is surely requisite, for one
      so good and kind as you are, to turn away and dishonor, not only the young
      girl herself, but every member of her family as well. You know that the
      whole city has its eyes fixed upon the conduct of the female portion of
      the court. To dismiss a maid of honor is to attribute a crime to her&mdash;at
      the very least a fault. What crime, what fault has Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere been guilty of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you constitute yourself the protector of Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere,&rdquo; replied Madame, coldly, &ldquo;I will give you those explanations
      which I should have a perfect right to withhold from every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even from the king!&rdquo; exclaimed Louis, as, with a sudden gesture, he
      covered his head with his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have called me your sister,&rdquo; said Madame, &ldquo;and I am in my own
      apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters not,&rdquo; said the youthful monarch, ashamed at having been
      hurried away by his anger; &ldquo;neither you, nor any one else in this kingdom,
      can assert a right to withhold an explanation in my presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that is the way you regard it,&rdquo; said Madame, in a hoarse, angry
      tone of voice, &ldquo;all that remains for me to do is bow submission to your
      majesty, and to be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so. Let there be no equivocation between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The protection with which you surround Mademoiselle de la Valliere does
      not impose any respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No equivocation, I repeat; you are perfectly aware that, as the head of
      the nobility in France, I am accountable to all for the honor of every
      family. You dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere, or whoever else it may be&mdash;&rdquo;
       Madame shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Or whoever else it may be, I repeat,&rdquo;
       continued the king; &ldquo;and as, acting in that manner, you cast a
      dishonorable reflection upon that person, I ask you for an explanation, in
      order that I may confirm or annul the sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annul my sentence!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame, haughtily. &ldquo;What! when I have
      discharged one of my attendants, do you order me to take her back again?&rdquo;
       The king remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would be a sheer abuse of power, sire; it would be indecorous and
      unseemly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a woman, I should revolt against an abuse so insulting to me; I should
      no longer be able to regard myself as a princess of your blood, a daughter
      of a monarch; I should be the meanest of creatures, more humbled and
      disgraced than the servant I had sent away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king rose from his seat with anger. &ldquo;It cannot be a heart,&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;you have beating in your bosom; if you act in such a way with me, I may
      have reason to act with corresponding severity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It sometimes happens that in a battle a chance ball may reach its mark.
      The observation which the king had made without any particular intention,
      struck Madame home, and staggered her for a moment; some day or other she
      might indeed have reason to dread reprisals. &ldquo;At all events, sire,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;explain what you require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask, madame, what has Mademoiselle de la Valliere done to warrant your
      conduct toward her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the most cunning fomenter of intrigues I know; she was the
      occasion of two personal friends engaging in mortal combat; and has made
      people talk of her in such shameless terms that the whole court is
      indignant at the mere sound of her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She! she!&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under her soft and hypocritical manner,&rdquo; continued Madame, &ldquo;she hides a
      disposition full of foul and dark conceit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may possibly be deceived, sire, but I know her right well; she is
      capable of creating dispute and misunderstanding between the most
      affectionate relatives and the most intimate friends. You see that she has
      already sown discord betwixt us two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do assure you&mdash;&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, look well into the case as it stands; we were living on the most
      friendly understanding, and by the artfulness of her tales and complaints,
      she has set your majesty against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;that on no occasion has a bitter word
      ever passed her lips; I swear that, even in my wildest bursts of passion,
      she would not allow me to menace any one; and I swear, too, that you do
      not possess a more devoted and respectful friend than she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend!&rdquo; said Madame, with an expression of supreme disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Madame!&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;you forget that you now understand
      me, and that from this moment everything is equalized. Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere will be whatever I may choose her to become; and to-morrow, if I
      were determined to do so, I could seat her on a throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was not born to a throne, at least, and whatever you may do can
      affect the future alone, but cannot affect the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, towards you I have shown every kind consideration, and every
      eager desire to please you; do not remind me that I am master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the second time, sire, that you have made that remark, and I have
      already informed you I am ready to submit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, then, you will confer upon me the favor of receiving
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what purpose, sire, since you have a throne to bestow upon her? I am
      too insignificant to protect so exalted a personage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, a truce to this bitter and disdainful spirit. Grant me her
      forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Never!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drive me, then, to open warfare in my own family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, have a family with whom I can find refuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that as a threat, and could you forget yourself so far? Do
      you believe that, if you push the affront to that extent, your family
      would encourage you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sire, that you will not force me to take any step which would be
      unworthy of my rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped that you would remember our recent friendship, and that you would
      treat me as a brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame paused for a moment. &ldquo;I do not disown you for a brother,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;in refusing your majesty an injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An injustice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire! if I informed others of La Valliere&rsquo;s conduct; if the queen
      knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Henrietta, let your heart speak; remember that, for however
      brief a time, you once loved me; remember, too, that human hearts should
      be as merciful as the heart of a sovereign Master. Do not be inflexible
      with others; forgive La Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot; she has offended me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is for your sake I would do anything in the world, except that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will drive me to despair&mdash;you compel me to turn to the last
      resource of weak people, and seek counsel of my angry and wrathful
      disposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you to be reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reasonable!&mdash;I can be so no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sire! I pray you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, Henrietta; it is the first time I entreated any one, and
      I have no hope in any one but in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire! you are weeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From rage, from humiliation. That I, the king, should have been obliged
      to descend to entreaty. I shall hate this moment during my whole life. You
      have made me suffer in one moment more distress and more degradation than
      I could have anticipated in the greatest extremity in life.&rdquo; And the king
      rose and gave free vent to his tears, which, in fact, were tears of anger
      and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame was not touched exactly&mdash;for the best women, when their pride
      is hurt, are without pity; but she was afraid that the tears the king was
      shedding might possibly carry away every soft and tender feeling in his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give what commands you please, sire,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and since you prefer my
      humiliation to your own&mdash;although mine is public and yours has been
      witnessed but by myself alone&mdash;speak, I will obey your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Henrietta!&rdquo; exclaimed Louis, transported with gratitude, &ldquo;you
      will have yielded to a brother&rsquo;s wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I no longer have any brother, since I obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I have would be too little in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How passionately you love, sire, when you do love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis did not answer. He had seized upon Madame&rsquo;s hand and covered it with
      kisses. &ldquo;And so you will receive this poor girl back again, and will
      forgive her; you will find how gentle and pure-hearted she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will maintain her in my household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you will give her your friendship, my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never liked her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my sake, you will treat her kindly, will you not, Henrietta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will treat her as your&mdash;<i>mistress</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king rose suddenly to his feet. By this word, which had so
      infelicitously escaped her, Madame had destroyed the whole merit of her
      sacrifice. The king felt freed from all obligations. Exasperated beyond
      measure, and bitterly offended, he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Madame; I shall never forget the service you have rendered
      me.&rdquo; And, saluting her with an affectation of ceremony, he took his leave
      of her. As he passed before a glass, he saw that his eyes were red, and
      angrily stamped his foot on the ground. But it was too late, for Malicorne
      and D&rsquo;Artagnan, who were standing at the door, had seen his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king has been crying,&rdquo; thought Malicorne. D&rsquo;Artagnan approached the
      king with a respectful air, and said in a low tone of voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it would be better to return to your own apartments by the small
      staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the dust of the road has left its traces on your face,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;when the king has given way like a
      child, let those look to it who may make the lady weep for whom the king
      sheds tears.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXI. Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s Pocket-Handkerchief.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame was not bad-hearted&mdash;she was only hasty and impetuous. The
      king was not imprudent&mdash;he was simply in love. Hardly had they
      entered into this compact, which terminated in La Valliere&rsquo;s recall, when
      they both sought to make as much as they could by their bargain. The king
      wished to see La Valliere every moment of the day, while Madame, who was
      sensible of the king&rsquo;s annoyance ever since he had so entreated her, would
      not relinquish her revenge on La Valliere without a contest. She planted
      every conceivable difficulty in the king&rsquo;s path; he was, in fact, obliged,
      in order to get a glimpse of La Valliere, to be exceedingly devoted in his
      attentions to his sister-in-law, and this, indeed, was Madame&rsquo;s plan of
      policy. As she had chosen some one to second her efforts, and as this
      person was our old friend Montalais, the king found himself completely
      hemmed in every time he paid Madame a visit; he was surrounded, and was
      never left a moment alone. Madame displayed in her conversation a charm of
      manner and brilliancy of wit which dazzled everybody. Montalais followed
      her, and soon rendered herself perfectly insupportable to the king, which
      was, in fact, the very thing she expected would happen. She then set
      Malicorne at the king, who found means of informing his majesty that there
      was a young person belonging to the court who was exceedingly miserable;
      and on the king inquiring who this person was, Malicorne replied that it
      was Mademoiselle de Montalais. To this the king answered that it was
      perfectly just that a person should be unhappy when she rendered others
      so. Whereupon Malicorne explained how matters stood; for he had received
      his directions from Montalais. The king began to open his eyes; he
      remarked that, as soon as he made his appearance, Madame made hers too;
      that she remained in the corridors until after he had left; that she
      accompanied him back to his own apartments, fearing that he might speak in
      the ante-chambers to one of her maids of honor. One evening she went
      further still. The king was seated, surrounded by the ladies who were
      present, and holding in his hand, concealed by his lace ruffle, a small
      note which he wished to slip into La Valliere&rsquo;s hand. Madame guessed both
      his intention and the letter too. It was difficult to prevent the king
      going wherever he pleased, and yet it was necessary to prevent his going
      near La Valliere, or speaking to her, as by so doing he could let the note
      fall into her lap behind her fan, or into her pocket-handkerchief. The
      king, who was also on the watch, suspected that a snare was being laid for
      him. He rose and pushed his chair, without affectation, near Mademoiselle
      de Chatillon, with whom he began to talk in a light tone. They were
      amusing themselves making rhymes; from Mademoiselle de Chatillon he went
      to Montalais, and then to Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente. And thus, by
      this skillful maneuver, he found himself seated opposite to La Valliere,
      whom he completely concealed. Madame pretended to be greatly occupied,
      altering a group of flowers that she was working in tapestry. The king
      showed the corner of his letter to La Valliere, and the latter held out
      her handkerchief with a look that signified, &ldquo;Put the letter inside.&rdquo;
       Then, as the king had placed his own handkerchief upon his chair, he was
      adroit enough to let it fall on the ground, so that La Valliere slipped
      her handkerchief on the chair. The king took it up quietly, without any
      one observing what he did, placed the letter within it, and returned the
      handkerchief to the place he had taken it from. There was only just time
      for La Valliere to stretch out her hand to take hold of the handkerchief
      with its valuable contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madame, who had observed everything that had passed, said to
      Mademoiselle de Chatillon, &ldquo;Chatillon, be good enough to pick up the
      king&rsquo;s handkerchief, if you please; it has fallen on the carpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl obeyed with the utmost precipitation, the king having moved
      from his seat, and La Valliere being in no little degree nervous and
      confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I beg your majesty&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Chatillon; &ldquo;you
      have two handkerchiefs, I perceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the king was accordingly obliged to put into his pocket La Valliere&rsquo;s
      handkerchief as well as his own. He certainly gained that souvenir of
      Louise, who lost, however, a copy of verses which had cost the king ten
      hours&rsquo; hard labor, and which, as far as he was concerned, was perhaps as
      good as a long poem. It would be impossible to describe the king&rsquo;s anger
      and La Valliere&rsquo;s despair; but shortly afterwards a circumstance occurred
      which was more than remarkable. When the king left, in order to retire to
      his own apartments, Malicorne, informed of what had passed, one can hardly
      tell how, was waiting in the ante-chamber. The ante-chambers of the Palais
      Royal are naturally very dark, and, in the evening, they were but
      indifferently lighted. Nothing pleased the king more than this dim light.
      As a general rule, love, whose mind and heart are constantly in a blaze,
      contemns all light, except the sunshine of the soul. And so the
      ante-chamber was dark; a page carried a torch before the king, who walked
      on slowly, greatly annoyed at what had recently occurred. Malicorne passed
      close to the king, almost stumbled against him in fact, and begged his
      forgiveness with the profoundest humility; but the king, who was in an
      exceedingly ill-temper, was very sharp in his reproof to Malicorne, who
      disappeared as soon and as quietly as he possibly could. Louis retired to
      rest, having had a misunderstanding with the queen; and the next day, as
      soon as he entered the cabinet, he wished to have La Valliere&rsquo;s
      handkerchief in order to press his lips to it. He called his valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the coat I wore yesterday evening, but be very sure
      you do not touch anything it may contain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The order being obeyed, the king himself searched the pocket of the coat;
      he found only one handkerchief, and that his own; La Valliere&rsquo;s had
      disappeared. Whilst busied with all kinds of conjectures and suspicions, a
      letter was brought to him from La Valliere; it ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good and kind of you to have sent me those beautiful verses; how full
      of ingenuity and perseverance your affection is; how is it possible to
      help loving you so dearly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; thought the king; &ldquo;there must be some mistake. Look
      well about,&rdquo; said he to the valet, &ldquo;for a pocket-handkerchief must be in
      one of my pockets; and if you do not find it, or if you have touched it&mdash;&rdquo;
       He reflected for a moment. To make a state matter of the loss of the
      handkerchief would be to act absurdly, and he therefore added, &ldquo;There was
      a letter of some importance inside the handkerchief, which had somehow got
      among the folds of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the valet, &ldquo;your majesty had only one handkerchief, and that
      is it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; replied the king, setting his teeth hard together. &ldquo;Oh,
      poverty, how I envy you! Happy is the man who can empty his own pockets of
      letters and handkerchiefs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read La Valliere&rsquo;s letter over again, endeavoring to imagine in what
      conceivable way his verses could have reached their destination. There was
      a postscript to the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I send you back by your messenger this reply, so unworthy of what you
      sent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far so good; I shall find out something now,&rdquo; he said delightedly.
      &ldquo;Who is waiting, and who brought me this letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Malicorne,&rdquo; replied the <i>valet de chambre</i>, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desire him to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come from Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&rdquo; said the king, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you took Mademoiselle de la Valliere something from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de la Valliere says so, distinctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire, Mademoiselle de la Valliere is mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king frowned. &ldquo;What jest is this?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;explain yourself. Why
      does Mademoiselle de la Valliere call you my messenger? What did you take
      to that lady? Speak, monsieur, and quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I merely took Mademoiselle de la Valliere a pocket-handkerchief,
      that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A handkerchief,&mdash;what handkerchief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, at the very moment when I had the misfortune to stumble against
      your majesty yesterday&mdash;a misfortune which I shall deplore to the
      last day of my life, especially after the dissatisfaction which you
      exhibited&mdash;I remained, sire, motionless with despair, your majesty
      being at too great a distance to hear my excuses, when I saw something
      white lying on the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stooped down,&mdash;it was a pocket-handkerchief. For a moment I had an
      idea that when I stumbled against your majesty I must have been the cause
      of the handkerchief falling from your pocket; but as I felt it all over
      very respectfully, I perceived a cipher at one of the corners, and, on
      looking at it closely, I found that it was Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s
      cipher. I presumed that on her way to Madame&rsquo;s apartment in the earlier
      part of the evening she had let her handkerchief fall, and I accordingly
      hastened to restore it to her as she was leaving; and that is all I gave
      to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, I entreat your majesty to believe.&rdquo;
       Malicorne&rsquo;s manner was so simple, so full of contrition, and marked with
      such extreme humility, that the king was greatly amused in listening to
      him. He was as pleased with him for what he had done as if he had rendered
      him the greatest service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the second fortunate meeting I have had with you, monsieur,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;you may count upon my good intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plain and sober truth was, that Malicorne had picked the king&rsquo;s pocket
      of the handkerchief as dexterously as any of the pickpockets of the good
      city of Paris could have done. Madame never knew of this little incident,
      but Montalais gave La Valliere some idea of the manner in which it had
      really happened, and La Valliere afterwards told the king, who laughed
      exceedingly at it and pronounced Malicorne to be a first rate politician.
      Louis XIV. was right, and it is well known that he was tolerably well
      acquainted with human nature.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXII. Which Treats of Gardeners, of Ladders, and Maids of Honor.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miracles, unfortunately, could not be always happening, whilst Madame&rsquo;s
      ill-humor still continued. In a week&rsquo;s time, matters had reached such a
      point, that the king could no longer look at La Valliere without a look
      full of suspicion crossing his own. Whenever a promenade was proposed,
      Madame, in order to avoid the recurrence of similar scenes to that of the
      thunder-storm, or the royal oak, had a variety of indispositions ready
      prepared; and, thanks to them, she was unable to go out, and her maids of
      honor were obliged to remain indoors also. There was not the slightest
      chance of means of paying a nocturnal visit; for in this respect the king
      had, on the very first occasion, experienced a severe check, which
      happened in the following manner. As at Fontainebleau, he had taken
      Saint-Aignan with him one evening when he wished to pay La Valliere a
      visit; but he had found no one but Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, who
      had begun to call out &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thieves!&rdquo; in such a manner that a
      perfect legion of chamber-maids, attendants, and pages, ran to her
      assistance; so that Saint-Aignan, who had remained behind in order to save
      the honor of his royal master, who had fled precipitately, was obliged to
      submit to a severe scolding from the queen-mother, as well as from Madame
      herself. In addition, he had, the next morning, received two challenges
      from the De Mortemart family, and the king had been obliged to interfere.
      This mistake had been owing to the circumstance of Madame having suddenly
      ordered a change in the apartments of her maids of honor, and directed La
      Valliere and Montalais to sleep in her own cabinet. No gateway, therefore,
      was any longer open&mdash;not even communication by letter; to write under
      the eyes of so ferocious an Argus as Madame, whose temper and disposition
      were so uncertain, was to run the risk of exposure to the greatest danger;
      and it can well be conceived into what a state of continuous irritation,
      and ever increasing anger, all these petty annoyances threw the young
      lion. The king almost tormented himself to death endeavoring to discover a
      means of communication; and, as he did not think proper to call in the aid
      of Malicorne or D&rsquo;Artagnan, the means were not discovered at all.
      Malicorne had, indeed, occasional brilliant flashes of imagination, with
      which he tried to inspire the king with confidence; but, whether from
      shame or suspicion, the king, who had at first begun to nibble at the
      bait, soon abandoned the hook. In this way, for instance, one evening,
      while the king was crossing the garden, and looking up at Madame&rsquo;s
      windows, Malicorne stumbled over a ladder lying beside a border of box,
      and said to Manicamp, then walking with him behind the king, &ldquo;Did you not
      see that I just now stumbled against a ladder, and was nearly thrown
      down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Manicamp, as usual very absent-minded, &ldquo;but it appears you did
      not fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter; but it is not on that account the less dangerous to
      leave ladders lying about in that manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, one might hurt one&rsquo;s self, especially when troubled with fits of
      absence of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that; what I did mean, was that it is dangerous to allow
      ladders to lie about so near the windows of the maids of honor.&rdquo; Louis
      started imperceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; inquired Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak louder,&rdquo; whispered Malicorne, as he touched him with his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said Manicamp, louder. The king listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, for instance,&rdquo; said Malicorne, &ldquo;a ladder nineteen feet high is
      just the height of the cornice of those windows.&rdquo; Manicamp, instead of
      answering, was dreaming of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me, can&rsquo;t you, what windows I mean,&rdquo; whispered Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what windows are you referring to?&rdquo; said Manicamp, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The windows of Madame&rsquo;s apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t say that any one would ever venture to go up a ladder into
      Madame&rsquo;s room; but in Madame&rsquo;s cabinet, merely separated by a partition,
      sleep two exceedingly pretty girls, Mesdemoiselles de la Valliere and de
      Montalais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a partition?&rdquo; said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look; you see how brilliantly lighted Madame&rsquo;s apartments are&mdash;well,
      do you see those two windows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that window close to the others, but more dimly lighted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is the room of the maids of honor. Look, there is Mademoiselle
      de la Valliere opening the window. Ah! how many soft things could an
      enterprising lover say to her, if he only suspected that there was lying
      here a ladder nineteen feet long, which would just reach the cornice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is not alone; you said Mademoiselle de Montalais is with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Montalais counts for nothing; she is her oldest friend,
      and exceedingly devoted to her&mdash;a positive well, into which can be
      thrown all sorts of secrets one might wish to get rid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king did not lose a single syllable of this conversation. Malicorne
      even remarked that his majesty slackened his pace, in order to give him
      time to finish. So, when they arrived at the door, Louis dismissed every
      one, with the exception of Malicorne&mdash;a circumstance which excited no
      surprise, for it was known that the king was in love; and they suspected
      he was going to compose some verses by moonlight; and, although there was
      no moon that evening, the king might, nevertheless, have some verses to
      compose. Every one, therefore, took his leave; and, immediately
      afterwards, the king turned towards Malicorne, who respectfully waited
      until his majesty should address him. &ldquo;What were you saying, just now,
      about a ladder, Monsieur Malicorne?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say anything about ladders, sire?&rdquo; said Malicorne, looking up, as
      if in search of words which had flown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of a ladder nineteen feet long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, sire, I remember; but I spoke to M. Manicamp, and I should not
      have said a word had I known your majesty was near enough to hear us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why would you not have said a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I should not have liked to get the gardener into a scrape who
      left it there&mdash;poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make yourself uneasy on that account. What is this ladder like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your majesty wishes to see it, nothing is easier, for there it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that box hedge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne turned back, and led the king up to the ladder, saying, &ldquo;This is
      it, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull it this way a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Malicorne had brought the ladder on to the gravel walk, the king
      began to step its whole length. &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you say it is nineteen
      feet long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen feet&mdash;that is rather long; I hardly believe it can be so
      long as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot judge very correctly with the ladder in that position, sire.
      If it were upright, against a tree or a wall, for instance, you would be
      better able to judge, because the comparison would assist you a good
      deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it does not matter, M. Malicorne; but I can hardly believe that the
      ladder is nineteen feet high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how accurate your majesty&rsquo;s glance is, and yet I would wager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king shook his head. &ldquo;There is one unanswerable means of verifying
      it,&rdquo; said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one knows, sire, that the ground-floor of the palace is eighteen
      feet high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, that is very well known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sire, if I place the ladder against the wall, we shall be able to
      ascertain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne took up the ladder, like a feather, and placed it upright
      against the wall. And, in order to try the experiment, he chose, or
      chance, perhaps, directed him to choose, the very window of the cabinet
      where La Valliere was. The ladder just reached the edge of the cornice,
      that is to say, the sill of the window; so that, by standing upon the last
      round but one of the ladder, a man of about the middle height, as the king
      was, for instance, could easily talk with those who might be in the room.
      Hardly had the ladder been properly placed, when the king, dropping the
      assumed part he had been playing in the comedy, began to ascend the rounds
      of the ladder, which Malicorne held at the bottom. But hardly had he
      completed half the distance when a patrol of Swiss guards appeared in the
      garden, and advanced straight towards them. The king descended with the
      utmost precipitation, and concealed himself among the trees. Malicorne at
      once perceived that he must offer himself as a sacrifice; for if he, too,
      were to conceal himself, the guard would search everywhere until they had
      found either himself or the king, perhaps both. It would be far better,
      therefore, that he alone should be discovered. And, consequently,
      Malicorne hid himself so clumsily that he was the only one arrested. As
      soon as he was arrested, Malicorne was taken to the guard-house, and there
      he declared who he was, and was immediately recognized. In the meantime,
      by concealing himself first behind one clump of trees and then behind
      another, the king reached the side door of his apartment, very much
      humiliated, and still more disappointed. More than that, the noise made in
      arresting Malicorne had drawn La Valliere and Montalais to their window;
      and even Madame herself had appeared at her own, with a pair of wax
      candles, one in each hand, clamorously asking what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Malicorne sent for D&rsquo;Artagnan, who did not lose a moment
      in hurrying to him. But it was in vain he attempted to make him understand
      his reasons, and in vain also that D&rsquo;Artagnan did understand them; and,
      further, it was equally in vain that both their sharp and intuitive minds
      endeavored to give another turn to the adventure; there was no other
      resource left for Malicorne but to let it be supposed that he had wished
      to enter Mademoiselle de Montalais&rsquo;s apartment, as Saint-Aignan had passed
      for having wished to force Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente&rsquo;s door. Madame
      was inflexible; in the first place, because, if Malicorne had, in fact,
      wished to enter her apartment at night through the window, and by means of
      the ladder, in order to see Montalais, it was a punishable offense on
      Malicorne&rsquo;s part, and he must be punished accordingly; and, in the second
      place, if Malicorne, instead of acting in his own name, had acted as an
      intermediary between La Valliere and a person whose name it was
      superfluous to mention, his crime was in that case even greater, since
      love, which is an excuse for everything, did not exist in the case as an
      excuse. Madame therefore made the greatest possible disturbance about the
      matter, and obtained his dismissal from Monsieur&rsquo;s household, without
      reflecting, poor blind creature, that both Malicorne and Montalais held
      her fast in their clutches in consequence of her visit to De Guiche, and
      in a variety of other ways equally delicate. Montalais, who was perfectly
      furious, wished to revenge herself immediately, but Malicorne pointed out
      to her that the king&rsquo;s countenance would repay them for all the disgraces
      in the world, and that it was a great thing to have to suffer on his
      majesty&rsquo;s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne was perfectly right, and, therefore, although Montalais had the
      spirit of ten women in her, he succeeded in bringing her round to his own
      opinion. And we must not omit to state that the king helped them to
      console themselves, for, in the first place, he presented Malicorne with
      fifty thousand francs as a compensation for the post he had lost, and, in
      the next place, he gave him an appointment in his own household, delighted
      to have an opportunity of revenging himself in such a manner upon Madame
      for all she had made him and La Valliere suffer. But as Malicorne could no
      longer carry significant handkerchiefs for him or plant convenient
      ladders, the royal lover was in a terrible state. There seemed to be no
      hope, therefore, of ever getting near La Valliere again, so long as she
      should remain at the Palais Royal. All the dignities and all the money in
      the world could not remedy that. Fortunately, however, Malicorne was on
      the lookout, and this so successfully that he met Montalais, who, to do
      her justice, it must be admitted, was doing her best to meet Malicorne.
      &ldquo;What do you do during the night in Madame&rsquo;s apartment?&rdquo; he asked the
      young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I go to sleep, of course,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is very wrong to sleep; it can hardly be possible that, with the
      pain you are suffering, you can manage to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what am I suffering from, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not in despair at my absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, since you have received fifty thousand francs and an
      appointment in the king&rsquo;s household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a matter of no moment; you are exceedingly afflicted at not
      seeing me as you used to see me formerly, and more than all, you are in
      despair at my having lost Madame&rsquo;s confidence; come now, is not that
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; your distress of mind prevents you sleeping at night, and so
      you sob, and sigh, and blow your nose ten times every minute as loud as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Malicorne, Madame cannot endure the slightest noise near
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that perfectly well; of course she can&rsquo;t endure anything; and so,
      I tell you, when she hears your deep distress, she will turn you out of
      her rooms without a moment&rsquo;s delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fortunate you <i>do</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what will happen next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next thing that will happen will be, that La Valliere, finding
      herself alone without you, will groan and utter such loud lamentations,
      that she will exhibit despair enough for two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case she will be put into <i>another</i> room, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that will puzzle you to say, Mr. Inventor-General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; whenever and whatever the room may be, it will always be
      preferable to Madame&rsquo;s own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, so begin your lamentations to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly will not fail to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And give La Valliere a hint also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t fear her, she cries quite enough already to herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! all she has to do is cry out loudly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they separated.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIII. Which Treats of Carpentry Operations, and Furnishes
      Details upon the Mode of Constructing Staircases.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The advice which had been given to Montalais was communicated by her to La
      Valliere, who could not but acknowledge that it was by no means deficient
      in judgment, and who, after a certain amount of resistance, rising rather
      from timidity than indifference to the project, resolved to put it into
      execution. This story of the two girls weeping, and filling Madame&rsquo;s
      bedroom with the noisiest lamentations, was Malicorne&rsquo;s <i>chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre</i>.
      As nothing is so probable as improbability, so natural as romance, this
      kind of Arabian Nights story succeeded perfectly with Madame. The first
      thing she did was to send Montalais away, and then, three days, or rather
      three nights afterwards, she had La Valliere removed. She gave the latter
      one of the small rooms on the top story, situated immediately over the
      apartments allotted to the gentlemen of Monsieur&rsquo;s suite. One story only,
      that is to say, a mere flooring separated the maids of honor from the
      officers and gentlemen of her husband&rsquo;s household. A private staircase,
      which was placed under Madame de Navailles&rsquo;s surveillance, was the only
      means of communication. For greater safety, Madame de Navailles, who had
      heard of his majesty&rsquo;s previous attempts, had the windows of the rooms and
      the openings of the chimneys carefully barred. There was, therefore, every
      possible security provided for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, whose room now
      bore more resemblance to a cage than to anything else. When Mademoiselle
      de la Valliere was in her own room, and she was there very frequently, for
      Madame scarcely ever had any occasion for her services, since she once
      knew she was safe under Madame de Navailles&rsquo;s inspection, Mademoiselle de
      la Valliere had no better means of amusing herself than looking through
      the bars of her windows. It happened, therefore, that one morning, as she
      was looking out as usual, she perceived Malicorne at one of the windows
      exactly opposite to her own. He held a carpenter&rsquo;s rule in his hand, was
      surveying the buildings, and seemed to be adding up some figures on paper.
      La Valliere recognized Malicorne and nodded to him; Malicorne, in his
      turn, replied by a formal bow, and disappeared from the window. She was
      surprised at this marked coolness, so different from his usual unfailing
      good-humor, but she remembered that he had lost his appointment on her
      account, and that he could hardly be very amiably disposed towards her,
      since, in all probability, she would never be in a position to make him
      any recompense for what he had lost. She knew how to forgive offenses, and
      with still more readiness could she sympathize with misfortune. La
      Valliere would have asked Montalais her opinion, if she had been within
      hearing, but she was absent, it being the hour she commonly devoted to her
      own correspondence. Suddenly La Valliere observed something thrown from
      the window where Malicorne had been standing, pass across the open space
      which separated the iron bars, and roll upon the floor. She advanced with
      no little curiosity towards this object, and picked it up; it was a wooden
      reel for silk, only, in this instance, instead of silk, a piece of paper
      was rolled round it. La Valliere unrolled it and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MADEMOISELLE,&mdash;I am exceedingly anxious to learn two things: the
      first is, to know if the flooring of your apartment is wood or brick; the
      second, to ascertain at what distance your bed is placed from the window.
      Forgive my importunity, and will you be good enough to send me an answer
      by the same way you receive this letter&mdash;that is to say, by means of
      the silk winder; only, instead of throwing into my room, as I have thrown
      it into yours, which will be too difficult for you to attempt, have the
      goodness merely to let it fall. Believe me, mademoiselle, your most
      humble, most respectful servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MALICORNE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write the reply, if you please, upon the letter itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! poor fellow,&rdquo; exclaimed La Valliere, &ldquo;he must have gone out of his
      mind;&rdquo; and she directed towards her correspondent&mdash;of whom she caught
      but a faint glimpse, in consequence of the darkness of the room&mdash;a
      look full of compassionate consideration. Malicorne understood her, and
      shook his head, as if he meant to say, &ldquo;No, no, I am not out of my mind;
      be quite satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, as if still in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he signified by a gesture, &ldquo;my head is right,&rdquo; and pointed to
      his head, then, after moving his hand like a man who writes very rapidly,
      he put his hands together as if entreating her to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere, even if he were mad, saw no impropriety in doing what
      Malicorne requested her; she took a pencil and wrote &ldquo;Wood,&rdquo; and then
      walked slowly from her window to her bed, and wrote, &ldquo;Six paces,&rdquo; and
      having done this, she looked out again at Malicorne, who bowed to her,
      signifying that he was about to descend. La Valliere understood that it
      was to pick up the silk winder. She approached the window, and, in
      accordance with Malicorne&rsquo;s instructions, let it fall. The winder was
      still rolling along the flag-stones as Malicorne started after it,
      overtook and picked it up, and beginning to peel it as a monkey would do
      with a nut, he ran straight towards M. de Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s apartment.
      Saint-Aignan had chosen, or rather solicited, that his rooms might be as
      near the king as possible, as certain plants seek the sun&rsquo;s rays in order
      to develop themselves more luxuriantly. His apartment consisted of two
      rooms, in that portion of the palace occupied by Louis XIV. himself. M. de
      Saint-Aignan was very proud of this proximity, which afforded easy access
      to his majesty, and, more than that, the favor of occasional unexpected
      meetings. At the moment we are now referring to, he was engaged in having
      both his rooms magnificently carpeted, with expectation of receiving the
      honor of frequent visits from the king; for his majesty, since his passion
      for La Valliere, had chosen Saint-Aignan as his confidant, and could not,
      in fact, do without him, either night or day. Malicorne introduced himself
      to the comte, and met with no difficulties, because he had been favorably
      noticed by the king; and also, because the credit which one man may happen
      to enjoy is always a bait for others. Saint-Aignan asked his visitor if he
      brought any news with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; great news,&rdquo; replied the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de la Valliere has changed her quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, opening his eyes very wide. &ldquo;She
      was living in the same apartments as Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely so; but Madame got tired of her proximity, and has installed
      her in a room which is situated exactly above your future apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! up there,&rdquo; exclaimed Saint-Aignan, with surprise, and pointing at
      the floor above him with his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Malicorne, &ldquo;yonder,&rdquo; indicating the building opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, then, by saying that her room is above my apartment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am sure that your apartment <i>ought</i>, providentially, to be
      under Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan, at this remark, gave poor Malicorne a look, similar to one
      of those La Valliere had already given a quarter of an hour before, that
      is to say, he thought he had lost his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Malicorne to him, &ldquo;I wish to answer what you are thinking
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;what I am thinking about&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reason is, that you have not clearly understood what I want to
      convey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you are aware that underneath the apartments set for Madame&rsquo;s
      maids of honor, the gentlemen in attendance on the king and on Monsieur
      are lodged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that, since Manicamp, De Wardes, and others are living
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Well, monsieur, admire the singularity of the circumstance;
      the two rooms destined for M. de Guiche are exactly the very two rooms
      situated underneath those which Mademoiselle de Montalais and Mademoiselle
      de la Valliere occupy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What then,&rsquo; do you say? Why, these two rooms are empty, since M. de
      Guiche is now lying wounded at Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, my dear fellow, I cannot grasp your meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! if I had the happiness to call myself Saint-Aignan, I should guess
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would you do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should at once change the rooms I am occupying here, for those which M.
      de Guiche is not using yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you suppose such a thing?&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, disdainfully. &ldquo;What!
      abandon the chief post of honor, the proximity to the king, a privilege
      conceded only to princes of the blood, to dukes, and peers! Permit me to
      tell you, my dear Monsieur de Malicorne, that you must be out of your
      senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the young man, seriously, &ldquo;you commit two mistakes. My
      name is Malicorne, simply; and I am in perfect possession of all my
      senses.&rdquo; Then, drawing a paper from his pocket, he said, &ldquo;Listen to what I
      am going to say; and afterwards, I will show you this paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that Madame looks after La Valliere as carefully as Argus did
      after the nymph Io.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that the king has sought for an opportunity, but uselessly, of
      speaking to the prisoner, and that neither you nor myself have yet
      succeeded in procuring him this piece of good fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly ought to know something about the subject, my poor
      Malicorne,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; what do you suppose would happen to the man whose imagination
      devised some means of bringing the lovers together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the king would set no bounds to his gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me ask you, then, M. de Saint-Aignan, whether you would not be
      curious to taste a little of this royal gratitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;any favor of my master, as a
      recognition of the proper discharge of my duty, would assuredly be most
      precious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, look at this paper, monsieur le comte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it&mdash;a plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a plan of M. de Guiche&rsquo;s two rooms, which, in all probability, will
      soon be your two rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, whatever may happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my rooms are the envy of too many gentlemen, to whom I certainly
      shall not give them up; M. de Roquelaure, for instance, M. de la Ferte,
      and M. de Dangeau, would all be anxious to get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I shall leave you, monsieur le comte, and I shall go and
      offer to one of those gentlemen the plan I have just shown you, together
      with the advantages annexed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you not keep them for yourself?&rdquo; inquired Saint-Aignan,
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the king would never do me the honor of paying me a visit openly,
      whilst he would readily go and see any one of those gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! the king would go and see any one of those gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go! most certainly he would ten times instead of once. Is it possible you
      can ask me if the king would go to an apartment which would bring him
      nearer to Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, delightfully near her, with a floor between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne unfolded the piece of paper which had been wrapped round the
      bobbin. &ldquo;Monsieur le comte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have the goodness to observe that
      the flooring of Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s room is merely a wooden
      flooring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! all you would have to do would be to get hold of a journeyman
      carpenter, lock him up in your apartments, without letting him know where
      you have taken him to, and let him make a hole in your ceiling, and
      consequently in the flooring of Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Saint-Aignan, as if dazzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, except that you have hit upon a singular, bold idea, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will seem a very trifling one to the king, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovers never think of the risk they run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What danger do you apprehend, monsieur le comte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, effecting such an opening as that will make a terrible noise: it
      could be heard all over the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur le comte, I am quite sure that the carpenter I shall select
      will not make the slightest noise in the world. He will saw an opening
      three feet square, with a saw covered with tow, and no one, not even those
      adjoining, will know that he is at work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Monsieur Malicorne, you astound, you positively bewilder me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To continue,&rdquo; replied Malicorne, quietly, &ldquo;in the room, the ceiling of
      which you will have cut through, you will put up a staircase, which will
      either allow Mademoiselle de la Valliere to descend into your room, or the
      king to ascend into Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the staircase will be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for in your room it will be hidden by a partition, over which you
      will throw a tapestry similar to that which covers the rest of the
      apartment; and in Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s room it will not be seen,
      for the trapdoor, which will be a part of the flooring itself, will be
      made to open under the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, whose eyes began to sparkle with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, monsieur le comte, there is no occasion to make you admit that
      the king will frequently come to the room where such a staircase is
      constructed. I think that M. Dangeau, particularly, will be struck by my
      idea, and I shall now go and explain to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Monsieur Malicorne, you forget that you spoke to me about it
      the first, and that I have consequently the right of priority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish for the preference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I wish it? Of course I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan, I am presenting you with a Jacob&rsquo;s
      ladder, which is better than the promise of an additional step in the
      peerage&mdash;perhaps, even with a good estate to accompany your dukedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; replied Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;it will give me an opportunity of
      showing the king that he is not mistaken in occasionally calling me his
      friend; an opportunity, dear M. Malicorne, for which I am indebted to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which you will not forget to remember?&rdquo; inquired Malicorne, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing will delight me more, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not the king&rsquo;s friend; I am simply his attendant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and if you imagine that that staircase is as good as a dukedom for
      myself, I think there will certainly be letters of nobility at the top of
      it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I have to do now,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;is to move as soon as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think the king will object to it. Ask his permission, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and see him this very moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will run and get the carpenter I was speaking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will he be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget your precautions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall be brought with his eyes bandaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will send you one of my carriages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one of my servants without livery. But stay, what will La Valliere
      say if she sees what is going on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I can assure you she will be very much interested in the operation,
      and I am equally sure that if the king has not courage enough to ascend to
      her room, she will have sufficient curiosity to come down to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will live in hope,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan; &ldquo;and now I am off to his
      majesty. At what time will the carpenter be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you suppose he will take to make this opening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a couple of hours; only afterwards he must have sufficient time to
      construct what may be called the hyphen between the two rooms. One night
      and a portion of the following day will do; we must not reckon upon less
      than two days, including putting up the staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two days, that is a very long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay; when one undertakes to open up communications with paradise itself,
      we must at least take care that the approaches are respectable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right; so farewell for a short time, dear M. Malicorne. I shall
      begin to remove the day after to-morrow, in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIV. The Promenade by Torchlight.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan, delighted with what he had just heard, and rejoiced at what
      the future foreshadowed for him, bent his steps towards De Guiche&rsquo;s two
      rooms. He who, a quarter of an hour previously, would hardly yield up his
      own rooms for a million francs, was now ready to expend a million, if it
      were necessary, upon the acquisition of the two happy rooms he coveted so
      eagerly. But he did not meet with so many obstacles. M. de Guiche did not
      yet know where he was to lodge, and, besides, was still too far ill to
      trouble himself about his lodgings; and so Saint-Aignan obtained De
      Guiche&rsquo;s two rooms without difficulty. As for M. Dangeau, he was so
      immeasurably delighted, that he did not even give himself the trouble to
      think whether Saint-Aignan had any particular reason for removing. Within
      an hour after Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s new resolution, he was in possession of the
      two rooms; and ten minutes later Malicorne entered, followed by the
      upholsterers. During this time, the king asked for Saint-Aignan; the valet
      ran to his late apartments and found M. Dangeau there; Dangeau sent him on
      to De Guiche&rsquo;s, and Saint-Aignan was found there; but a little delay had
      of course taken place, and the king had already exhibited once or twice
      evident signs of impatience, when Saint-Aignan entered his royal master&rsquo;s
      presence, quite out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too, abandon me, then,&rdquo; said Louis XIV., in a similar tone of
      lamentation to that with which Caesar, eighteen hundred years previously,
      had pronounced the <i>Et tu quoque</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I am far from abandoning you, for, on the contrary, I am busily
      occupied in changing my lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? I thought you had finished moving three days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire. But I don&rsquo;t find myself comfortable where I am, so I am going
      to change to the opposite side of the building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not right when I said you were abandoning me?&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
      &ldquo;Oh! this exceeds all endurance. But so it is: there was only one woman
      for whom my heart cared at all, and all my family is leagued together to
      tear her from me; and my friend, to whom I confided my distress, and who
      helped me to bear up under it, has become wearied of my complaints and is
      going to leave me without even asking my permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan began to laugh. The king at once guessed there must be some
      mystery in this want of respect. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried the king, full of
      hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, sire, that the friend whom the king calumniates is going to try if
      he cannot restore to his sovereign the happiness he has lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to let me see La Valliere?&rdquo; said Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say so, positively, but I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;how?&mdash;tell me that, Saint-Aignan. I wish to know what your
      project is, and to help you with all my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;I cannot, even myself, tell very well how I
      must set about attaining success; but I have every reason to believe that
      from to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, do you say! What happiness! But why are you changing your
      rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to serve your majesty to better advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can your moving serve me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to know where the two rooms destined for De Guiche are
      situated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your majesty now knows where I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; but that does not help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is it possible that you do not understand, sire, that above De
      Guiche&rsquo;s lodgings are two rooms, one of which is Mademoiselle Montalais&rsquo;s,
      and the other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Valliere&rsquo;s, is it not so, Saint-Aignan? Oh! yes, yes. It is a
      brilliant idea, Saint-Aignan, a true friend&rsquo;s idea, a poet&rsquo;s idea. By
      bringing me nearer her from whom the world seems to unite to separate me&mdash;you
      are far more than Pylades was for Orestes, or Patroclus for Achilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Aignan, with a smile, &ldquo;I question whether, if your majesty
      were to know my projects in their full extent, you would continue to
      pronounce such a pompous eulogium upon me. Ah! sire, I know how very
      different are the epithets which certain Puritans of the court will not
      fail to apply to me when they learn of what I intend to do for your
      majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint-Aignan, I am dying with impatience; I am in a perfect fever; I
      shall never be able to wait until to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow! why,
      to-morrow is an eternity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, sire, I shall require you, if you please, to go out presently
      and divert your impatience by a good walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you&mdash;agreed; we will talk about your projects, we will talk of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sire; I remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom shall I go out with, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the queen and all the ladies of the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing shall induce me to do that, Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, sire, you must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Must?</i>&mdash;no, no&mdash;a thousand times no! I will never again
      expose myself to the horrible torture of being close to her, of seeing
      her, of touching her dress as I pass by her, and yet not be able to say a
      word to her. No, I renounce a torture which you suppose will bring me
      happiness, but which consumes and eats away my very life; to see her in
      the presence of strangers, and not to tell her that I love her, when my
      whole being reveals my affection and betrays me to every one; no! I have
      sworn never to do it again, and I will keep my oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, sire, pray listen to me for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will listen to nothing, Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I will continue; it is most urgent, sire&mdash;pray
      understand me, it is of the greatest importance&mdash;that Madame and her
      maids of honor should be absent for two hours from the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand your meaning at all, Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard for me to give my sovereign directions what to do; but under
      the circumstances I do give you directions, sire; and either a hunting or
      a promenade party must be got up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I were to do what you wish, it would be a caprice, a mere whim. In
      displaying such an impatient humor I show my whole court that I have no
      control over my own feelings. Do not people already say that I am dreaming
      of the conquest of the world, but that I ought previously to begin by
      achieving a conquest over myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who say so, sire, are as insolent as they would like to be thought
      facetious; but whomever they may be, if your majesty prefers to listen to
      them, I have nothing further to say. In such a case, that which we have
      fixed to take place to-morrow must be postponed indefinitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Saint-Aignan, I will go out this evening&mdash;I will go by
      torchlight to Saint-Germain: I will breakfast there to-morrow, and will
      return to Paris by three o&rsquo;clock. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I will set out this evening at eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty has fixed upon the exact minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you positively will tell me nothing more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because I have nothing more to tell you. Industry counts for
      something in this world, sire; but still, chance plays so important a part
      in it that I have been accustomed to leave her the sidewalk, confident
      that she will manage so as to always take the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I abandon myself entirely to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comforted in this manner, the king went immediately to Madame, to whom he
      announced the intended expedition. Madame fancied at the first moment that
      she saw in this unexpectedly arranged party a plot of the king&rsquo;s to
      converse with La Valliere, either on the road under cover of the darkness,
      or in some other way, but she took especial care not to show any of her
      fancies to her brother-in-law, and accepted the invitation with a smile
      upon her lips. She gave directions aloud that her maids of honor should
      accompany her, secretly intending in the evening to take the most
      effectual steps to interfere with his majesty&rsquo;s attachment. Then, when she
      was alone, and at the very moment the poor lover, who had issued orders
      for the departure, was reveling in the idea that Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere would form one of the party,&mdash;luxuriating in the sad
      happiness persecuted lovers enjoy of realizing through the sense of sight
      alone all the transports of possession,&mdash;Madame, who was surrounded
      by her maids of honor, was saying:&mdash;&ldquo;Two ladies will be enough for me
      this evening, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente and Mademoiselle de
      Montalais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere had anticipated her own omission, and was prepared for it: but
      persecution had rendered her courageous, and she did not give Madame the
      pleasure of seeing on her face the impression of the shock her heart
      received. On the contrary, smiling with that ineffable gentleness which
      gave an angelic expression to her features&mdash;&ldquo;In that case, Madame, I
      shall be at liberty this evening, I suppose?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be able to employ it, then, in progressing with that piece of
      tapestry which your highness has been good enough to notice, and which I
      have already had the honor of offering to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And having made a respectful obeisance she withdrew to her own apartment;
      Mesdemoiselles de Tonnay-Charente and de Montalais did the same. The rumor
      of the intended promenade soon spread all over the palace; ten minutes
      afterwards Malicorne learned Madame&rsquo;s resolution, and slipped under
      Montalais&rsquo;s door a note, in the following terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L. V. must positively pass the night the night with Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais, in pursuance of the compact she had entered into, began by
      burning the letter, and then sat down to reflect. Montalais was a girl
      full of expedients, and so she very soon arranged her plan. Towards five
      o&rsquo;clock, which was the hour for her to repair to Madame&rsquo;s apartment, she
      was running across the courtyard, and had reached within a dozen paces of
      a group of officers, when she uttered a cry, fell gracefully on one knee,
      rose again, with difficulty, and walked on limpingly. The gentlemen ran
      forward to her assistance; Montalais had sprained her foot. Faithful to
      the discharge of her duty, she insisted, however, notwithstanding her
      accident, upon going to Madame&rsquo;s apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, and why do you limp so?&rdquo; she inquired; &ldquo;I mistook you
      for La Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais related how it had happened, that in hurrying on, in order to
      arrive as quickly as possible, she had sprained her foot. Madame seemed to
      pity her, and wished to have a surgeon sent for immediately, but she,
      assuring her that there was nothing really serious in the accident, said:
      &ldquo;My only regret, Madame, is, that it will preclude my attendance on you,
      and I should have begged Mademoiselle de la Valliere to take my place with
      your royal highness, but&mdash;&rdquo; seeing that Madame frowned, she added&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have not done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not do so?&rdquo; inquired Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because poor La Valliere seemed so happy to have her liberty for a whole
      evening and night too, that I did not feel courageous enough to ask her to
      take my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, is she so delighted as that?&rdquo; inquired madame, struck by these
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is wild with delight; she, who is always so melancholy, was singing
      like a bird. Besides, your highness knows how much she detests going out,
      and also that her character has a spice of wildness in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; thought Madame, &ldquo;this extreme delight hardly seems natural to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has already made all her preparations for dining in her own room <i>tete-a-tete</i>
      with one of her favorite books. And then, as your highness has six other
      young ladies who would be delighted to accompany you, I did not make my
      proposal to La Valliere.&rdquo; Madame did not say a word in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I acted properly?&rdquo; continued Montalais, with a slight fluttering of
      the heart, seeing the little success that seemed to attend the <i>ruse de
      guerre</i> which she had relied upon with so much confidence that she had
      not thought it even necessary to try and find another. &ldquo;Does Madame
      approve of what I have done?&rdquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame was reflecting that the king could very easily leave Saint-Germain
      during the night, and that, as it was only four leagues and a half from
      Paris to Saint-Germain, he might readily be in Paris in an hour&rsquo;s time.
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whether La Valliere, when she heard of your
      accident, offered at least to bear you company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she does not yet know of my accident; but even did she know of it, I
      most certainly should not ask her to do anything that might interfere with
      her own plans. I think she wishes this evening to realize quietly by
      herself that amusement of the late king, when he said to M. de Cinq-Mars,
      &lsquo;Let us amuse ourselves by doing nothing, and making ourselves
      miserable.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame felt convinced that some mysterious love adventure lurked behind
      this strong desire for solitude. The secret <i>might</i> be Louis&rsquo;s return
      during the night; it could not be doubted any longer La Valliere had been
      informed of his intended return, and that was the reason for her delight
      at having to remain behind at the Palais Royal. It was a plan settled and
      arranged beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not be their dupe though,&rdquo; said Madame, and she took a decisive
      step. &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Montalais,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you have the goodness
      to inform your friend, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, that I am exceedingly
      sorry to disarrange her projects of solitude, but that instead of becoming
      <i>ennuyee</i> by remaining behind alone as she wished, she will be good
      enough to accompany us to Saint-Germain and get <i>ennuyee</i> there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! poor La Valliere,&rdquo; said Montalais, compassionately, but with her
      heart throbbing with delight; &ldquo;oh, Madame, could there not be some means&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Madame; &ldquo;I desire it. I prefer Mademoiselle la Baume le
      Blanc&rsquo;s society to that of any one else. Go, and send her to me, and take
      care of your foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais did not wait for the order to be repeated; she returned to her
      room, almost forgetting to feign lameness, wrote an answer to Malicorne,
      and slipped it under the carpet. The answer simply said: &ldquo;She shall.&rdquo; A
      Spartan could not have written more laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this means,&rdquo; thought Madame, &ldquo;I will look narrowly after all on the
      road; she shall sleep near me during the night, and his majesty must be
      very clever if he can exchange a single word with Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere received the order to set off with the same indifferent
      gentleness with which she had received the order to play Cinderella. But,
      inwardly, her delight was extreme, and she looked upon this change in the
      princess&rsquo;s resolution as a consolation which Providence had sent her. With
      less penetration than Madame possessed, she attributed all to chance.
      While every one, with the exception of those in disgrace, of those who
      were ill, and those who were suffering from sprains, were being driven
      towards Saint-Germain, Malicorne smuggled his workman into the palace in
      one of M. de Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s carriages, and led him into the room
      corresponding to La Valliere&rsquo;s. The man set to work with a will, tempted
      by the splendid reward which had been promised him. As the very best tools
      and implements had been selected from the reserve stock belonging to the
      engineers attached to the king&rsquo;s household&mdash;and among others, a saw
      with teeth so sharp and well tempered that it was able, under water even,
      to cut through oaken joists as hard as iron&mdash;the work in question
      advanced very rapidly, and a square portion of the ceiling, taken from
      between two of the joists, fell into the arms of the delighted
      Saint-Aignan, Malicorne, the workman, and a confidential valet, the latter
      being one brought into the world to see and hear everything, but to repeat
      nothing. In accordance with a new plan indicated by Malicorne, the opening
      was effected in an angle of the room&mdash;and for this reason. As there
      was no dressing-closet adjoining La Valliere&rsquo;s room, she had solicited,
      and had that very morning obtained, a large screen intended to serve as a
      partition. The screen that had been allotted her was perfectly sufficient
      to conceal the opening, which would, besides, be hidden by all the
      artifices skilled cabinet-makers would have at their command. The opening
      having been made, the workman glided between the joists, and found himself
      in La Valliere&rsquo;s room. When there, he cut a square opening in the
      flooring, and out of the boards he manufactured a trap so accurately
      fitting into the opening that the most practised eye could hardly detect
      the necessary interstices made by its lines of juncture with the floor.
      Malicorne had provided for everything: a ring and a couple of hinges which
      had been bought for the purpose, were affixed to the trap-door; and a
      small circular stair-case, packed in sections, had been bought ready made
      by the industrious Malicorne, who had paid two thousand francs for it. It
      was higher than what was required, but the carpenter reduced the number of
      steps, and it was found to suit exactly. This staircase, destined to
      receive so illustrious a burden, was merely fastened to the wall by a
      couple of iron clamps, and its base was fixed into the floor of the
      comte&rsquo;s room by two iron pegs screwed down tightly, so that the king, and
      all his cabinet councilors too, might pass up and down the staircase
      without any fear. Every blow of the hammer fell upon a thick pad or
      cushion, and the saw was not used until the handle had been wrapped in
      wool, and the blade steeped in oil. The noisiest part of the work,
      moreover, had taken place during the night and early in the morning, that
      is to say, when La Valliere and Madame were both absent. When, about two
      o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the court returned to the Palais Royal, La
      Valliere went up into her own room. Everything was in its proper place&mdash;not
      the smallest particle of sawdust, not the smallest chip, was left to bear
      witness to the violation of her domicile. Saint-Aignan, however, wishing
      to do his utmost in forwarding the work, had torn his fingers and his
      shirt too, and had expended no ordinary amount of perspiration in the
      king&rsquo;s service. The palms of his hands were covered with blisters,
      occasioned by his having held the ladder for Malicorne. He had, moreover,
      brought up, one by one, the seven pieces of the staircase, each consisting
      of two steps. In fact, we can safely assert that, if the king had seen him
      so ardently at work, his majesty would have sworn an eternal gratitude
      towards his faithful attendant. As Malicorne anticipated, the workman had
      completely finished the job in twenty-four hours; he received twenty-four
      louis, and left, overwhelmed with delight, for he had gained in one day as
      much as six months&rsquo; hard work would have procured him. No one had the
      slightest suspicion of what had taken place in the room under Mademoiselle
      de la Valliere&rsquo;s apartment. But in the evening of the second day, at the
      very moment La Valliere had just left Madame&rsquo;s circle and returned to her
      own room, she heard a slight creaking sound in one corner. Astonished, she
      looked to see whence it proceeded, and the noise began again. &ldquo;Who is
      there?&rdquo; she said, in a tone of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Louise,&rdquo; replied the well-known voice of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! you!&rdquo; cried the young girl, who for a moment fancied herself under
      the influence of a dream. &ldquo;But where? You, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied the king, opening one of the folds of the screen, and
      appearing like a ghost at the end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere uttered a loud cry, and fell trembling into an armchair, as
      the king advanced respectfully towards her.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXV. The Apparition.
    </h2>
    <p>
      La Valliere very soon recovered from her surprise, for, owing to his
      respectful bearing, the king inspired her with more confidence by his
      presence than his sudden appearance had deprived her of. But, as he
      noticed that which made La Valliere most uneasy was the means by which he
      had effected an entrance into her room, he explained to her the system of
      the staircase concealed by the screen, and strongly disavowed the notion
      of his being a supernatural appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire!&rdquo; said La Valliere, shaking her fair head with a most engaging
      smile, &ldquo;present or absent, you do not appear to my mind more at one time
      than at another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means, Louise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what you know so well, sire; that there is not one moment in which
      the poor girl whose secret you surprised at Fontainebleau, and whom you
      came to snatch from the foot of the cross itself, does not think of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise, you overwhelm me with joy and happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere smiled mournfully, and continued: &ldquo;But, sire, have you
      reflected that your ingenious invention could not be of the slightest
      service to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? Tell me,&mdash;I am waiting most anxiously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because this room may be subject to being searched at any moment of the
      day. Madame herself may, at any time, come here accidentally; my
      companions run in at any moment they please. To fasten the door on the
      inside, is to denounce myself as plainly as if I had written above, &lsquo;No
      admittance,&mdash;the king is within!&rsquo; Even now, sire, at this very
      moment, there is nothing to prevent the door opening, and your majesty
      being seen here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the king, laughingly, &ldquo;I should indeed be taken for a
      phantom, for no one can tell in what way I came here. Besides, it is only
      spirits that can pass through brick walls, or floors and ceilings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire, reflect for a moment how terrible the scandal would be! Nothing
      equal to it could ever have been previously said about the maids of honor,
      poor creatures! whom evil report, however, hardly ever spares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your conclusion from all this, my dear Louise,&mdash;come, explain
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! it is a hard thing to say&mdash;but your majesty must suppress
      staircase plots, surprises and all; for the evil consequences which would
      result from your being found here would be far greater than our happiness
      in seeing each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Louise,&rdquo; replied the king, tenderly, &ldquo;instead of removing this
      staircase by which I have ascended, there is a far more simple means, of
      which you have not thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A means&mdash;another means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, another. Oh, you do not love me as I love you, Louise, since my
      invention is quicker than yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the king, who held out his hand to her, which she took and
      gently pressed between her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were saying,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;that I shall be detected coming
      here, where any one who pleases can enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, sire; at this very moment, even while you are speaking about it, I
      tremble with dread of your being discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would not be found out, Louise, if you were to descend the
      staircase which leads to the room underneath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire! what do you say?&rdquo; cried Louise, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not quite understand me, Louise, since you get offended at my very
      first word; first of all, do you know to whom the apartments underneath
      belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To M. de Guiche, sire, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; they are M. de Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; cried La Valliere; and this exclamation which escaped from
      the young girl&rsquo;s joyous heart made the king&rsquo;s heart throb with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to Saint-Aignan, <i>our friend</i>,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sire,&rdquo; returned La Valliere, &ldquo;I cannot visit M. de Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s
      rooms any more than I could M. de Guiche&rsquo;s. It is impossible&mdash;impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Louise, I should have thought that, under the safe-conduct of
      the king, you would venture anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the safe-conduct of the king,&rdquo; she said, with a look full of
      tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have faith in my word, I hope, Louise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, when you are not present; but when you are present,&mdash;when
      you speak to me,&mdash;when I look upon you, I have faith in nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can possibly be done to reassure you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is scarcely respectful, I know, to doubt the king, but&mdash;for me&mdash;you
      are <i>not</i> the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven!&mdash;I, at least, hope so most devoutly; you see how
      anxiously I am trying to find or invent a means of removing all
      difficulty. Stay; would the presence of a third person reassure you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The presence of M. de Saint-Aignan would, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Louise, you wound me by your suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louise did not answer, she merely looked steadfastly at him with that
      clear, piercing gaze which penetrates the very heart, and said softly to
      herself, &ldquo;Alas! alas! it is not you of whom I am afraid,&mdash;it is not
      you upon whom my doubts would fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king, sighing, &ldquo;I agree; and M. de Saint-Aignan, who
      enjoys the inestimable privilege of reassuring you, shall always be
      present at our interviews, I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promise that, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honor as a gentleman; and you, on your side&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wait, sire, that is not all yet; for such conversations ought, at
      least, to have a reasonable motive of some kind for M. de Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Louise, every shade of delicacy of feeling is yours, and my only
      study is to equal you on that point. It shall be just as you wish:
      therefore our conversations shall have a reasonable motive, and I have
      already hit upon one; so that from to-morrow, if you like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you meant that that is not soon enough?&rdquo; exclaimed the king, caressing
      La Valliere&rsquo;s hand between his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the sound of steps was heard in the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire! sire!&rdquo; cried La Valliere, &ldquo;some one is coming; do you hear? Oh,
      fly! fly! I implore you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king made but one bound from the chair where he was sitting to his
      hiding-place behind the screen. He had barely time; for as he drew one of
      the folds before him, the handle of the door was turned, and Montalais
      appeared at the threshold. As a matter of course she entered quite
      naturally, and without any ceremony, for she knew perfectly well that to
      knock at the door beforehand would be showing a suspicion towards La
      Valliere which would be displeasing to her. She accordingly entered, and
      after a rapid glance round the room, in the brief course of which she
      observed two chairs very close to each other, she was so long in shutting
      the door, which seemed to be difficult to close, one can hardly tell how
      or why, that the king had ample time to raise the trap-door, and to
      descend again to Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; she said to her, &ldquo;I want to talk to you, and seriously, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! my dear Aure, what is the matter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is, that Madame suspects <i>everything</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any occasion for us to enter into explanations, and do you not
      understand what I mean? Come, you must have noticed the fluctuations in
      Madame&rsquo;s humor during several days past; you must have noticed how she
      first kept you close beside her, then dismissed you, and then sent for you
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have noticed it, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seems Madame has now succeeded in obtaining sufficient
      information, for she has now gone straight to the point, as there is
      nothing further left in France to withstand the torrent which sweeps away
      all obstacles before it; you know what I mean by the torrent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere hid her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; continued Montalais, pitilessly, &ldquo;that torrent which burst
      through the gates of the Carmelites of Chaillot, and overthrew all the
      prejudices of the court, as well at Fontainebleau as at Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; murmured La Valliere, her face still covered by her hands,
      and her tears streaming through her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t distress yourself in that manner, or you have only heard half
      of your troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl, in great anxiety, &ldquo;what is
      the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, this is how the matter stands: Madame, who can no longer rely
      upon any further assistance in France; for she has, one after the other,
      made use of the two queens, of Monsieur, and the whole court, too, now
      bethinks herself of a certain person who has certain pretended rights over
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere became as white as a marble statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This person,&rdquo; continued Madame, &ldquo;is not in Paris at this moment; but, if
      I am not mistaken, is, just now, in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; breathed La Valliere, almost overwhelmed with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is to be found, I think, at the court of Charles II.; am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this evening a letter has been dispatched by Madame to Saint
      James&rsquo;s, with directions for the courier to go straight to Hampton Court,
      which I believe is one of the royal residences, situated about a dozen
      miles from London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; as Madame writes regularly to London once a fortnight, and as the
      ordinary courier left for London not more than three days ago, I have been
      thinking that some serious circumstance alone could have induced her to
      write again so soon, for you know she is a very indolent correspondent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This letter has been written, therefore, something tells me so, at least,
      on your account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my account?&rdquo; repeated the unhappy girl, mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, who saw the letter lying on Madame&rsquo;s desk before she sealed it,
      fancied I could read&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you fancy you could read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might possibly have been mistaken, though&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&mdash;what was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name of Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere rose hurriedly from her chair, a prey to the most painful
      agitation. &ldquo;Montalais,&rdquo; she said, her voice broken by sobs, &ldquo;all my
      smiling dreams of youth and innocence have fled already. I have nothing
      now to conceal, either from you or any one else. My life is exposed to
      every one&rsquo;s inspection, and can be opened like a book, in which all the
      world can read, from the king himself to the first passer-by. Aure,
      dearest Aure, what can I do&mdash;what will become of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais approached close to her, and said, &ldquo;Consult your own heart, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; I do not love M. de Bragelonne; when I say I do not love him,
      understand that I love him as the most affectionate sister could love the
      best of brothers, but that is not what he requires, nor what I promised
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, you love the king,&rdquo; said Montalais, &ldquo;and that is a sufficiently
      good excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do love the king,&rdquo; hoarsely murmured the young girl, &ldquo;and I have
      paid dearly enough for pronouncing those words. And now, Montalais, tell
      me&mdash;what can you do either for me, or against me, in my position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must speak more clearly still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to say, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you have nothing very particular to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Louise, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; and so all you have to ask me is my advice respecting M.
      Raoul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very delicate subject,&rdquo; replied Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is nothing of the kind. Ought I to marry him in order to keep the
      promise I made, or ought I continue to listen to the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have really placed me in a very difficult position,&rdquo; said Montalais,
      smiling; &ldquo;you ask me if you ought to marry Raoul, whose friend I am, and
      whom I shall mortally offend in giving my opinion against him; and then,
      you ask me if you should cease to listen to the king, whose subject I am,
      and whom I should offend if I were to advise you in a particular way. Ah,
      Louise, you seem to hold a difficult position at a very cheap rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not understood me, Aure,&rdquo; said La Valliere, wounded by the
      slightly mocking tone of her companion; &ldquo;if I were to marry M. de
      Bragelonne, I should be far from bestowing on him the happiness he
      deserves; but, for the same reason, if I listen to the king he would
      become the possessor of one indifferent in very many aspects, I admit, but
      one whom his affection confers an appearance of value. What I ask you,
      then, is to tell me some means of disengaging myself honorably either from
      the one or from the other; or rather, I ask you, from which side you think
      I can free myself most honorably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Louise,&rdquo; replied Montalais, after a pause, &ldquo;I am not one of the
      seven wise men of Greece, and I have no perfectly invariable rules of
      conduct to govern me; but, on the other hand, I have a little experience,
      and I can assure you that no woman ever asks for advice of the nature
      which you have just asked me, without being in a terrible state of
      embarrassment. Besides, you have made a solemn promise, which every
      principle of honor requires you to fulfil; if, therefore, you are
      embarrassed, in consequence of having undertaken such an engagement, it is
      not a stranger&rsquo;s advice (every one is a stranger to a heart full of love),
      it is not my advice, I repeat, that can extricate you from your
      embarrassment. I shall not give it you, therefore; and for a greater
      reason still&mdash;because, were I in your place, I should feel much more
      embarrassed after the advice than before it. All I can do is, to repeat
      what I have already told you; shall I assist you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; that is all. Tell me in what way you wish me to help you; tell
      me for and against whom,&mdash;in this way we shall not make any
      blunders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first of all,&rdquo; said La Valliere, pressing her companion&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;for
      whom or against whom do you decide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you, if you are really and truly my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not Madame&rsquo;s confidant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A greater reason for being of service to you; if I were not to know what
      is going on in that direction I should not be of any service at all, and
      consequently you would not obtain any advantage from my acquaintance.
      Friendships live and thrive upon a system of reciprocal benefits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The result is, then, that you will remain at the same time Madame&rsquo;s
      friend also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently. Do you complain of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; sighed La Valliere, thoughtfully, for this cynical
      frankness appeared to her an offense both to the woman and the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All well and good, then,&rdquo; said Montalais, &ldquo;for if you did, you would be
      very foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to serve me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devotedly&mdash;if you will serve me in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would almost say that you do not know my heart,&rdquo; said La Valliere,
      looking at Montalais with her eyes wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the fact is, that since we have belonged to the court, my dear
      Louise, we are very much changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very simple. Were you the second queen of France yonder, at Blois?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere hung down her head, and began to weep. Montalais looked at her
      in an indefinable manner, and murmured &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; and then, adding,
      &ldquo;Poor king!&rdquo; she kissed Louise on the forehead, and returned to her
      apartment, where Malicorne was waiting for her.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVI. The Portrait.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In that malady which is termed love the paroxysms succeed each other at
      intervals, ever accelerating from the moment the disease declares itself.
      By and by, the paroxysms are less frequent, in proportion as the cure
      approaches. This being laid down as a general axiom, and as the leading
      article of a particular chapter, we will now proceed with our recital. The
      next day, the day fixed by the king for the first conversation in
      Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s room, La Valliere, on opening one of the folds of the
      screen, found upon the floor a letter in the king&rsquo;s handwriting. The
      letter had been passed, through a slit in the floor, from the lower
      apartment to her own. No indiscreet hand or curious gaze could have
      brought or did bring this single paper. This, too, was one of Malicorne&rsquo;s
      ideas. Having seen how very serviceable Saint-Aignan would become to the
      king on account of his apartment, he did not wish that the courtier should
      become still more indispensable as a messenger, and so he had, on his own
      private account, reserved this last post for himself. La Valliere most
      eagerly read the letter, which fixed two o&rsquo;clock that same afternoon for
      the rendezvous, and which indicated the way of raising the trap-door which
      was constructed out of the flooring. &ldquo;Make yourself look as beautiful as
      you can,&rdquo; added the postscript of the letter, words which astonished the
      young girl, but at the same time reassured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed away very slowly, but the time fixed, however, arrived at
      last. As punctual as the priestess Hero, Louise lifted up the trap-door at
      the last stroke of the hour of two, and found the king on the steps,
      waiting for her with the greatest respect, in order to give her his hand
      to descend. The delicacy and deference shown in this attention affected
      her very powerfully. At the foot of the staircase the two lovers found the
      comte, who, with a smile and a low reverence distinguished by the best
      taste, expressed his thanks to La Valliere for the honor she conferred
      upon him. Then turning towards the king, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, our man is here.&rdquo; La Valliere looked at the king with some
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;if I have begged you to do me the honor of
      coming down here, it was from an interested motive. I have procured a most
      admirable portrait painter, who is celebrated for the fidelity of his
      likenesses, and I wish you to be kind enough to authorize him to paint
      yours. Besides, if you positively wish it, the portrait shall remain in
      your own possession.&rdquo; La Valliere blushed. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the king to
      her, &ldquo;we shall not be three as you wished, but four instead. And, so long
      as we are not alone, there can be as many present as you please.&rdquo; La
      Valliere gently pressed her royal lover&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we pass into the next room, sire?&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, opening the
      door to let his guests precede him. The king walked behind La Valliere,
      and fixed his eyes lingeringly and passionately upon that neck as white as
      snow, upon which her long fair ringlets fell in heavy masses. La Valliere
      was dressed in a thick silk robe of pearl gray color, with a tinge of
      rose, with jet ornaments, which displayed to greater effect the dazzling
      purity of her skin, holding in her slender and transparent hands a bouquet
      of heartsease, Bengal roses, and clematis, surrounded with leaves of the
      tenderest green, above which uprose, like a tiny goblet spilling magic
      influence a Haarlem tulip of gray and violet tints of a pure and beautiful
      species, which had cost the gardener five years&rsquo; toil of combinations, and
      the king five thousand francs. Louis had placed this bouquet in La
      Valliere&rsquo;s hand as he saluted her. In the room, the door of which
      Saint-Aignan had just opened, a young man was standing, dressed in a
      purple velvet jacket, with beautiful black eyes and long brown hair. It
      was the painter; his canvas was quite ready, and his palette prepared for
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to La Valliere with the grave curiosity of an artist who is
      studying his model, saluted the king discreetly, as if he did not
      recognize him, and as he would, consequently, have saluted any other
      gentleman. Then, leading Mademoiselle de la Valliere to the seat he had
      arranged for her, he begged her to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl assumed an attitude graceful and unrestrained, her hands
      occupied and her limbs reclining on cushions; and in order that her gaze
      might not assume a vague or affected expression, the painter begged her to
      choose some kind of occupation, so as to engage her attention; whereupon
      Louis XIV., smiling, sat down on the cushions at La Valliere&rsquo;s feet; so
      that she, in the reclining posture she had assumed, leaning back in the
      armchair, holding her flowers in her hand, and he, with his eyes raised
      towards her and fixed devouringly on her face&mdash;they, both together,
      formed so charming a group, that the artist contemplated painting it with
      professional delight, while on his side, Saint-Aignan regarded them with
      feelings of envy. The painter sketched rapidly; and very soon, beneath the
      earliest touches of the brush, there started into life, out of the gray
      background, the gentle, poetry-breathing face, with its soft calm eyes and
      delicately tinted cheeks, enframed in the masses of hair which fell about
      her neck. The lovers, however, spoke but little, and looked at each other
      a great deal; sometimes their eyes became so languishing in their gaze,
      that the painter was obliged to interrupt his work in order to avoid
      representing an Erycina instead of La Valliere. It was on such occasions
      that Saint-Aignan came to the rescue, and recited verses, or repeated one
      of those little tales such as Patru related, and Tallemant des Reaux wrote
      so cleverly. Or, it might be that La Valliere was fatigued, and the
      sitting was, therefore, suspended for awhile; and, immediately, a tray of
      precious porcelain laden with the most beautiful fruits which could be
      obtained, and rich wines distilling their bright colors in silver goblets,
      beautifully chased, served as accessories to the picture of which the
      painter could but retrace the most ephemeral resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis was intoxicated with love, La Valliere with happiness, Saint-Aignan
      with ambition, and the painter was storing up recollections for his old
      age. Two hours passed away in this manner, and four o&rsquo;clock having struck,
      La Valliere rose, and made a sign to the king. Louis also rose, approached
      the picture, and addressed a few flattering remarks to the painter.
      Saint-Aignan also praised the picture, which, as he pretended, was already
      beginning to assume an accurate resemblance. La Valliere in her turn,
      blushingly thanked the painter and passed into the next room, where the
      king followed her, after having previously summoned Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not come to-morrow?&rdquo; he said to La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, pray think that some one will be sure to come to my room, and
      will not find me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of me in that case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very apprehensive, Louise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at all events, suppose Madame were to send for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;will the day never come when you yourself will
      tell me to brave everything so that I may not have to leave you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On that day, sire, I shall be quite out of my mind, and you must not
      believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, Louise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere sighed, but, without the courage to oppose her royal lover&rsquo;s
      wish, she repeated, &ldquo;To-morrow, then, since you desire it, sire,&rdquo; and with
      these words she ran lightly up the stairs, and disappeared from her
      lover&rsquo;s gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sire?&rdquo; inquired Saint-Aignan, when she had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Saint-Aignan, yesterday I thought myself the happiest of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does your majesty, then, regard yourself to-day,&rdquo; said the comte,
      smiling, &ldquo;as the unhappiest of men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but my love for her is an unquenchable thirst; in vain do I drink, in
      vain do I swallow the drops of water which your industry procures for me;
      the more I drink, the more unquenchable it becomes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, that is in some degree your own fault, and your majesty alone has
      made the position such as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, therefore, the means to be happy, is to fancy yourself
      satisfied, and to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! you know that word, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, sire&mdash;do not despair: I have already been at work on
      your behalf&mdash;I have still other resources in store.&rdquo; The king shook
      his head in a despairing manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sire! have you not been satisfied hitherto?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, indeed, yes, my dear Saint-Aignan; but invent, for Heaven&rsquo;s
      sake, invent some further project yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I undertake to do my best, and that is all that any one can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king wished to see the portrait again, as he was unable to see the
      original. He pointed out several alterations to the painter and left the
      room, and then Saint-Aignan dismissed the artist. The easel, paints, and
      painter himself, had scarcely gone, when Malicorne showed his head in the
      doorway. He was received by Saint-Aignan with open arms, but still with a
      little sadness, for the cloud which had passed across the royal sun,
      veiled, in its turn, the faithful satellite, and Malicorne at a glance
      perceived the melancholy that brooded on Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur le comte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how sad you seem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And good reason too, my dear Monsieur Malicorne. Will you believe that
      the king is still dissatisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With his staircase, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; on the contrary, he is delighted with the staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The decorations of the apartments, I suppose, don&rsquo;t please him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he has not even thought of that. No, indeed, it seems that what has
      dissatisfied the king&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, monsieur le comte,&mdash;he is dissatisfied at finding
      himself the fourth person at a rendezvous of this kind. How is it possible
      you could not have guessed that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how is it likely I could have done so, dear M. Malicorne, when I
      followed the king&rsquo;s instructions to the very letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did his majesty really insist on your being present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And also required that the painter, whom I met downstairs just now,
      should be here, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He insisted upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I can easily understand why his majesty is dissatisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! dissatisfied that I have so punctually and so literally obeyed his
      orders? I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne began to scratch his ear, as he asked, &ldquo;What time did the king
      fix for the rendezvous in your apartments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were waiting for the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since half-past one; it would have been a fine thing, indeed, to
      have been unpunctual with his majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne, notwithstanding his respect for Saint-Aignan, could not help
      smiling. &ldquo;And the painter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did the king wish him to be here at
      two o&rsquo;clock, also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I had him waiting here from midday. Far better, you know, for a
      painter to be kept waiting a couple of hours than the king a single
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne began to laugh aloud. &ldquo;Come, dear Monsieur Malicorne,&rdquo; said
      Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;laugh less at me, and speak a little more freely, I beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, monsieur le comte, if you wish the king to be a little more
      satisfied the next time he comes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ventre saint-gris!</i>&rsquo; as his grandfather used to say; of course I
      wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all you have to do is, when the king comes to-morrow, to be obliged
      to go away on a most pressing matter of business, which cannot possibly be
      postponed, and stay away for twenty minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! leave the king alone for twenty minutes?&rdquo; cried Saint-Aignan, in
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, do as you like; don&rsquo;t pay any attention to what I say,&rdquo; said
      Malicorne, moving towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, dear Monsieur Malicorne; on the contrary, go on&mdash;I begin
      to understand you. But the painter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the painter must be half an hour late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour&mdash;do you really think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do, decidedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, I will do as you tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my opinion is, that you will be doing perfectly right. Will you allow
      me to call upon you for the latest news to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honor to be your most respectful servant, M. de Saint-Aignan,&rdquo;
       said Malicorne, bowing profoundly and retiring from the room backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt that fellow has more invention than I have,&rdquo; said
      Saint-Aignan, as if compelled by his conviction to admit it.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVII. Hampton Court.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The revelation we have witnessed, that Montalais made to La Valliere, in a
      preceding chapter, very naturally makes us return to the principal hero of
      this tale, a poor wandering knight, roving about at the king&rsquo;s caprice. If
      our readers will be good enough to follow us, we will, in his company,
      cross that strait, more stormy than the Euripus, which separates Calais
      from Dover; we will speed across that green and fertile country, with its
      numerous little streams; through Maidstone, and many other villages and
      towns, each prettier than the other; and, finally, arrive at London. From
      thence, like bloodhounds following a track, after having ascertained that
      Raoul had made his first stay at Whitehall, his second at St. James&rsquo;s, and
      having learned that he had been warmly received by Monk, and introduced to
      the best society of Charles II.&lsquo;s court, we will follow him to one of
      Charles II.&lsquo;s summer residences near the lively little village of
      Kingston, at Hampton Court, situated on the Thames. The river is not, at
      that spot, the boastful highway which bears upon its broad bosom its
      thousands of travelers; nor are its waters black and troubled as those of
      Cocytus, as it boastfully asserts, &ldquo;I, too, am cousin of the old ocean.&rdquo;
       No, at Hampton Court it is a soft and murmuring stream, with moss-fringed
      banks, reflecting, in its broad mirror, the willows and beeches which
      ornament its sides, and on which may occasionally be seen a light bark
      indolently reclining among the tall reeds, in a little creek formed of
      alders and forget-me-nots. The surrounding country on all sides smiled in
      happiness and wealth; the brick cottages from whose chimneys the blue
      smoke was slowly ascending in wreaths, peeped forth from the belts of
      green holly which environed them; children dressed in red frocks appeared
      and disappeared amidst the high grass, like poppies bowed by the gentler
      breath of the passing breeze. The sheep, ruminating with half-closed eyes,
      lay lazily about under the shadow of the stunted aspens, while, far and
      near, the kingfishers, plumed with emerald and gold, skimmed swiftly along
      the surface of the water, like a magic ball heedlessly touching, as he
      passed, the line of his brother angler, who sat watching in his boat the
      fish as they rose to the surface of the sparkling stream. High above this
      paradise of dark shadows and soft light, rose the palace of Hampton Court,
      built by Wolsey&mdash;a residence the haughty cardinal had been obliged,
      timid courtier that he was, to offer to his master, Henry VIII., who had
      glowered with envy and cupidity at the magnificent new home. Hampton
      Court, with its brick walls, its large windows, its handsome iron gates,
      as well as its curious bell turrets, its retired covered walks, and
      interior fountains, like those of the Alhambra, was a perfect bower of
      roses, jasmine, and clematis. Every sense, sight and smell particularly,
      was gratified, and the reception-rooms formed a very charming framework
      for the pictures of love which Charles II. unrolled among the voluptuous
      paintings of Titian, of Pordenone and of Van Dyck; the same Charles whose
      father&rsquo;s portrait&mdash;the martyr king&mdash;was hanging in his gallery,
      and who could show upon the wainscots of the various apartments the holes
      made by the balls of the puritanical followers of Cromwell, when on the
      24th of August, 1648, at the time they had brought Charles I. prisoner to
      Hampton Court. There it was that the king, intoxicated with pleasure and
      adventure, held his court&mdash;he, who, a poet in feeling, thought
      himself justified in redeeming, by a whole day of voluptuousness, every
      minute which had been formerly passed in anguish and misery. It was not
      the soft green sward of Hampton Court&mdash;so soft that it almost
      resembled the richest velvet in the thickness of its texture&mdash;nor was
      it the beds of flowers, with their variegated hues which encircled the
      foot of every tree with rose-trees many feet in height, embracing most
      lovingly their trunks&mdash;nor even the enormous lime-trees, whose
      branches swept the earth like willows, offering a ready concealment for
      love or reflection beneath the shade of their foliage&mdash;it was none of
      these things for which Charles II. loved his palace of Hampton Court.
      Perhaps it might have been that beautiful sheet of water, which the cool
      breeze rippled like the wavy undulations of Cleopatra&rsquo;s hair, waters
      bedecked with cresses and white water-lilies, whose chaste bulbs coyly
      unfolding themselves beneath the sun&rsquo;s warm rays, reveal the golden gems
      which lie concealed within their milky petals&mdash;murmuring waters, on
      the bosom of which black swans majestically floated, and the graceful
      water-fowl, with their tender broods covered with silken down, darted
      restlessly in every direction, in pursuit of the insects among the reeds,
      or the fogs in their mossy retreats. Perhaps it might have been the
      enormous hollies, with their dark and tender green foliage; or the bridges
      uniting the banks of the canals in their embrace; or the fawns browsing in
      the endless avenues of the park; or the innumerable birds that hopped
      about the gardens, or flew from branch to branch, amidst the emerald
      foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might well have been any of these charms&mdash;for Hampton Court had
      them all; and possessed, too, almost forests of white roses, which climbed
      and trailed along the lofty trellises, showering down upon the ground
      their snowy leaves rich with soft perfumery. But no, what Charles II. most
      loved in Hampton Court were the charming figures who, when midday was
      past, flitted to and fro along the broad terraces of the gardens; like
      Louis XIV., he had their wealth of beauties painted for his gallery by one
      of the great artists of the period&mdash;an artist who well knew the
      secret of transferring to canvas the rays of light which escaped from
      beaming eyes heavy laden with love and love&rsquo;s delights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of our arrival at Hampton Court is almost as clear and bright as a
      summer&rsquo;s day in France; the atmosphere is heavy with the delicious perfume
      of geraniums, sweet-peas, seringas, and heliotrope scattered in profusion
      around. It is past midday, and the king, having dined after his return
      from hunting, paid a visit to Lady Castlemaine, the lady who was reputed
      at the time to hold his heart in bondage; and this proof of his devotion
      discharged, he was readily permitted to pursue his infidelities until
      evening arrived. Love and amusement ruled the entire court; it was the
      period when ladies would seriously interrogate their ruder companions as
      to their opinions upon a foot more or less captivating, according to
      whether it wore a pink or lilac silk stocking&mdash;for it was the period
      when Charles II. had declared that there was no hope of safety for a woman
      who wore green silk stockings, because Miss Lucy Stewart wore them of that
      color. While the king is endeavoring in all directions to inculcate others
      with his preferences on this point, we will ourselves bend our steps
      towards an avenue of beech-trees opposite the terrace, and listen to the
      conversation of a young girl in a dark-colored dress, who is walking with
      another of about her own age dressed in blue. They crossed a beautiful
      lawn, from the center of which sprang a fountain, with the figure of a
      siren executed in bronze, and strolled on, talking as they went, towards
      the terrace, along which, looking out upon the park and interspersed at
      frequent intervals, were erected summer-houses, diverse in form and
      ornament; these summer-houses were nearly all occupied; the two young
      women passed on, the one blushing deeply, while the other seemed dreamily
      silent. At last, having reached the end of the terrace which looks on the
      river, and finding there a cool retreat, they sat down close to each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; said the younger to her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, we are going where you yourself led the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you; to the extremity of the palace, towards that seat yonder, where
      the young Frenchman is seated, wasting his time in sighs and
      lamentations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mary Grafton hurriedly said, &ldquo;No, no; I am not going there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go back, Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, on the contrary, let us go on, and have an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About how it happens that the Vicomte de Bragelonne always accompanies
      you in all your walks, as you invariably accompany him in his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you conclude either that he loves me, or that I love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&mdash;he is a most agreeable and charming companion.&mdash;No
      one hears me, I hope,&rdquo; said Lucy Stewart, as she turned round with a
      smile, which indicated, moreover, that her uneasiness on the subject was
      not extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;the king is engaged in his summer-house with the
      Duke of Buckingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>a propos</i> of the duke, Mary, it seems he has shown you great
      attention since his return from France; how is your own heart in that
      direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Grafton shrugged her shoulders with seeming indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I will ask Bragelonne about it,&rdquo; said Stewart, laughing; &ldquo;let
      us go and find him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, one word before you do: come, come, you who know so many of the
      king&rsquo;s secrets, tell me why M. de Bragelonne is in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he was sent as an envoy from one sovereign to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be; but, seriously, although politics do not much concern us, we
      know enough to be satisfied that M. de Bragelonne has no mission of
      serious import here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, listen,&rdquo; said Stewart, with assumed gravity, &ldquo;for your sake I
      am going to betray a state secret. Shall I tell you the nature of the
      letter which King Louis XIV. gave M. de Bragelonne for King Charles II.? I
      will; these are the very words: &lsquo;My brother, the bearer of this is a
      gentleman attached to my court, and the son of one whom you regard most
      warmly. Treat him kindly, I beg, and try and make him like England.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Word for word&mdash;or something very like it. I will not answer for the
      form, but the substance I am sure of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what conclusion do you, or rather what conclusion does the
      king, draw from that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the king of France has his own reasons for removing M. de
      Bragelonne, and for getting him married anywhere else than in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that, then, in consequence of this letter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King Charles received M. de Bragelonne, as you are aware, in the most
      distinguished and friendly manner; the handsomest apartments in Whitehall
      were allotted to him; and as you are the most valuable and precious person
      in his court, inasmuch as you have rejected his heart,&mdash;nay, do not
      blush,&mdash;he wished you to take a fancy to this Frenchman, and he was
      desirous to confer upon him so costly a prize. And this is the reason why
      you, the heiress of three hundred thousand pounds, a future duchess, so
      beautiful, so good, have been thrown in Bragelonne&rsquo;s way, in all the
      promenades and parties of pleasure to which he was invited. In fact it was
      a plot,&mdash;a kind of conspiracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Grafton smiled with that charming expression which was habitual to
      her, and pressing her companion&rsquo;s arm, said: &ldquo;Thank the king, Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, but the Duke of Buckingham is jealous, so take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had she pronounced these words, when the duke appeared from one of
      the pavilions on the terrace, and, approaching the two girls, with a
      smile, said, &ldquo;You are mistaken, Miss Lucy; I am not jealous; and the
      proof, Miss Mary, is yonder, in the person of M. de Bragelonne himself,
      who ought to be the cause of my jealousy, but who is dreaming in pensive
      solitude. Poor fellow! Allow me to leave you for a few minutes, while I
      avail myself of those few minutes to converse with Miss Lucy Stewart, to
      whom I have something to say.&rdquo; And then, bowing to Lucy, he added, &ldquo;Will
      you do me the honor to accept my hand, in order that I may lead you to the
      king, who is waiting for us?&rdquo; With these words, Buckingham, still smiling,
      took Miss Stewart&rsquo;s hand, and led her away. When by herself, Mary Grafton,
      her head gently inclined towards her shoulder, with that indolent
      gracefulness of action which distinguishes young English girls, remained
      for a moment with her eyes fixed on Raoul, but as if uncertain what to do.
      At last, after first blushing violently, and then turning deadly pale,
      thus revealing the internal combat which assailed her heart, she seemed to
      make up her mind to adopt a decided course, and with a tolerably firm
      step, advanced towards the seat on which Raoul was reclining, buried in
      the profoundest meditation, as we have already said. The sound of Miss
      Mary&rsquo;s steps, though they could hardly be heard upon the green sward,
      awakened Raoul from his musing attitude; he turned round, perceived the
      young girl, and walked forward to meet the companion whom his happy
      destiny had thrown in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been sent to you, monsieur,&rdquo; said Mary Grafton; &ldquo;will you take
      care of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom is my gratitude due, for so great a happiness?&rdquo; inquired Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Duke of Buckingham,&rdquo; replied Mary, affecting a gayety she did not
      really feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Duke of Buckingham, do you say?&mdash;he who so passionately seeks
      your charming society! Am I really to believe you are serious,
      mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, monsieur, you perceive, that everything seems to conspire to
      make us pass the best, or rather the longest, part of our days together.
      Yesterday it was the king who desired me to beg you to seat yourself next
      to me at dinner; to-day, it is the Duke of Buckingham who begs me to come
      and place myself near you on this seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has gone away in order to leave us together?&rdquo; asked Raoul, with
      some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look yonder, at the turning of that path; he is just out of sight, with
      Miss Stewart. Are these polite attentions usual in France, monsieur le
      vicomte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot very precisely say what people do in France, mademoiselle, for I
      can hardly be called a Frenchman. I have resided in many countries, and
      almost always as a soldier; and then, I have spent a long period of my
      life in the country. I am almost a savage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not like your residence in England, I fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; said Raoul, inattentively, and sighing deeply at the
      same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you do not know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said Raoul, shaking his head, and collecting his thoughts,
      &ldquo;I did not hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the young girl, sighing in her turn, &ldquo;how wrong the duke was to
      send me here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong!&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;perhaps so; for I am but a rude, uncouth companion,
      and my society annoys you. The duke did, indeed, very wrong to send you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is precisely,&rdquo; replied Mary Grafton, in a clear, calm voice, &ldquo;because
      your society does not annoy me, that the duke was wrong to send me to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now Raoul&rsquo;s turn to blush. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;how happens it that
      the Duke of Buckingham should send you to me; and why did you come? the
      duke loves you, and you love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mary, seriously, &ldquo;the duke does not love me, because he is
      in love with the Duchesse d&rsquo;Orleans; and, as for myself, I have no
      affection for the duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul looked at the young lady with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a friend of the Duke of Buckingham?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The duke has honored me by calling me so ever since we met in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are simple acquaintances, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for the duke is the most intimate friend of one whom I regard as a
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duc de Guiche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who is in love with Madame la Duchesse d&rsquo;Orleans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! What is that you are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who loves him in return,&rdquo; continued the young girl, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul bent down his head, and Mary Grafton, sighing deeply, continued,
      &ldquo;They are very happy. But, leave me, Monsieur de Bragelonne, for the Duke
      of Buckingham has given you a very troublesome commission in offering me
      as a companion for your promenade. Your heart is elsewhere, and it is with
      the greatest difficulty you can be charitable enough to lend me your
      attention. Confess truly; it would be unfair on your part, vicomte, not to
      admit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I do confess it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him steadily. He was so noble and so handsome in his
      bearing, his eyes revealed so much gentleness, candor, and resolution,
      that the idea could not possibly enter her mind that he was either rudely
      discourteous, or a mere simpleton. She only perceived, clearly enough,
      that he loved another woman, and not herself, with the whole strength of
      his heart. &ldquo;Ah! I now understand you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you have left your heart
      behind you in France.&rdquo; Raoul bowed. &ldquo;The duke is aware of your affection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one knows it,&rdquo; replied Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, therefore, do you tell me? Nay, answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for me, then, to anticipate an explanation; you do not wish to tell
      me anything, because you are now convinced that I do not love the duke;
      because you see that I possibly might have loved you; because you are a
      gentleman of noble and delicate sentiments; and because, instead of
      accepting, even were it for the mere amusement of the passing hour, a hand
      which is almost pressed upon you; and because, instead of meeting my
      smiles with a smiling lip, you, who are young, have preferred to tell me,
      whom men have called beautiful, &lsquo;My heart is over the sea&mdash;it is in
      France.&rsquo; For this, I thank you, Monsieur de Bragelonne; you are, indeed, a
      noble-hearted, noble-minded man, and I regard you all the more for it, as
      a friend only. And now let us cease speaking of myself, and talk of your
      own affairs. Forget that I have ever spoken to you of myself, tell me why
      you are sad, and why you have become more than usually so during these
      past four days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul was deeply and sensibly moved by these sweet and melancholy tones;
      and as he could not, at the moment, find a word to say, the young girl
      again came to his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My mother was born in France, and I can truly affirm
      that I, too, am French in blood, as well as in feeling; but the leaden
      atmosphere and characteristic gloom of England seem to weigh upon me.
      Sometimes my dreams are golden-hued and full of wonderful enjoyments, when
      suddenly a mist rises and overspreads my fancy, blotting them out forever.
      Such, indeed, is the case at the present moment. Forgive me; I have now
      said enough on that subject; give me your hand, and relate your griefs to
      me as a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you are French in heart and soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, not only, I repeat it, that my mother was French, but, further, as
      my father, a friend of King Charles I., was exiled in France, I, during
      the trial of that prince, as well as during the Protector&rsquo;s life, was
      brought up in Paris; at the Restoration of King Charles II., my poor
      father returned to England, where he died almost immediately afterwards;
      and then the king created me a duchess, and has dowered me according to my
      rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any relations in France?&rdquo; Raoul inquired, with the deepest
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a sister there, my senior by seven or eight years, who was married
      in France, and was early left a widow; her name is Madame de Belliere. Do
      you know her?&rdquo; she added, observing Raoul start suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She, too, loves with her whole heart; and her last letters inform me she
      is happy, and her affection is, I conclude, returned. I told you, Monsieur
      de Bragelonne, that although I possess half of her nature, I do not share
      her happiness. But let us now speak of yourself; whom do you love in
      France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young girl, as soft and pure as a lily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she loves you, why are you sad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told that she ceases to love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not believe it, I trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who wrote me so does not sign his letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An anonymous denunciation! some treachery, be assured,&rdquo; said Miss
      Grafton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Raoul, showing the young girl a letter which he had read over
      a thousand times; she took it from his hand and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;VICOMTE,&mdash;You are perfectly right to amuse yourself yonder with the
      lovely faces of Charles II.&lsquo;s court, for at Louis XIV.&lsquo;s court, the castle
      in which your affections are enshrined is being besieged. Stay in London
      altogether, poor vicomte, or return without delay to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no signature,&rdquo; said Miss Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe it not, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; but here is a second letter, from my friend De Guiche, which
      says, &lsquo;I am lying here wounded and ill. Return, Raoul, oh, return!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you intend doing?&rdquo; inquired the young girl, with a feeling of
      oppression at her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My intention, as soon as I received this letter, was immediately to take
      my leave of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you receive it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day before yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dated Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A singular circumstance, do you not think, for the court is now at Paris?
      At all events, I would have set off; but when I mentioned my intention to
      the king, he began to laugh, and said to me, &lsquo;How comes it, monsieur
      l&rsquo;amassadeur, that you think of leaving? Has your sovereign recalled you?&rsquo; 
      I colored, naturally enough, for I was confused by the question; for the
      fact is, the king himself sent me here, and I have received no order to
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary frowned in deep thought, and said, &ldquo;Do you remain, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever receive any letters from her to whom you are so devoted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, do you say? Does she not love you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, she has not written to me since my departure, although she used
      occasionally to write to me before. I trust she may have been prevented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! the duke is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Buckingham at that moment was seen at the end of the walk, approaching
      towards them, alone and smiling; he advanced slowly, and held out his
      hands to them both. &ldquo;Have you arrived at an understanding?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About whatever might render you happy, dear Mary, and make Raoul less
      miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, my lord,&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my view of the subject, Miss Mary; do you wish me to mention it
      before M. de Bragelonne?&rdquo; he added, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean,&rdquo; replied the young girl, haughtily, &ldquo;that I was not
      indisposed to love M. de Bragelonne, that is useless, for I have told him
      so myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham reflected for a moment, and, without seeming in any way
      discountenanced, as she expected, he said: &ldquo;My reason for leaving you with
      M. de Bragelonne was, that I thoroughly knew your refined delicacy of
      feeling, no less than the perfect loyalty of your mind and heart, and I
      hoped that M. de Bragelonne&rsquo;s cure might be effected by the hands of a
      physician such as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my lord, before you spoke of M. de Bragelonne&rsquo;s heart, you spoke to
      me of your own. Do you mean to effect the cure of two hearts at the same
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true, madame; but you will do me the justice to admit that I
      have long discontinued a useless pursuit, acknowledging that my own wound
      is incurable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Mary, collecting herself for a moment before she spoke,
      &ldquo;M. de Bragelonne is happy, for he loves and is beloved. He has no need of
      such a physician as I can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Bragelonne,&rdquo; said Buckingham, &ldquo;is on the very eve of experiencing a
      serious misfortune, and he has greater need than ever of sympathy and
      affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself, my lord,&rdquo; inquired Raoul, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; gradually I will explain myself; but, if you desire it, I can tell
      Miss Grafton what you may not listen to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, you are putting me to the torture; you know something you wish
      to conceal from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that Miss Mary Grafton is the most charming object that a heart
      ill at ease could possibly meet with in its way through life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you that the Vicomte de Bragelonne loves elsewhere,&rdquo;
       said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is wrong, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you assume to know, my lord, that <i>I</i> am wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom is it that he loves, then?&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves a lady who is unworthy of him,&rdquo; said Buckingham, with that calm,
      collected manner peculiar to Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Grafton uttered a cry, which, together with the remark that
      Buckingham had that moment made, spread over De Bragelonne&rsquo;s features a
      deadly paleness, arising from the sudden surprise, and also from a vague
      fear of impending misfortune. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you have just
      pronounced words which compel me, without a moment&rsquo;s delay, to seek their
      explanation in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remain here,&rdquo; said Buckingham, &ldquo;because you have no right to
      leave; and no one has the right to quit the service of the king for that
      of any woman, even were she as worthy of being loved as Mary Grafton is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell me all, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, on condition that you will remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will remain, if you will promise to speak openly and without reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far had their conversation proceeded, and Buckingham, in all
      probability, was on the point of revealing, not indeed all that had taken
      place, but at least all he was aware of, when one of the king&rsquo;s attendants
      appeared at the end of the terrace, and advanced towards the summer-house
      where the king was sitting with Lucy Stewart. A courier followed him,
      covered with dust from head to foot, and who seemed as if he had but a few
      moments before dismounted from his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The courier from France! Madame&rsquo;s courier!&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, recognizing
      the princess&rsquo;s livery; and while the attendant and the courier advanced
      towards the king, Buckingham and Miss Grafton exchanged a look full of
      intelligence with each other.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVIII. The Courier from Madame.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charles II. was busily engaged in proving, or in endeavoring to prove, to
      Miss Stewart that she was the only person for whom he cared at all, and
      consequently was avowing to her an affection similar to that which his
      ancestor Henry IV. had entertained for Gabrielle. Unfortunately for
      Charles II., he had hit upon an unlucky day, the very day Miss Stewart had
      taken it into her head to make him jealous, and therefore, instead of
      being touched by his offer, as the king had hoped, she laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, sire,&rdquo; she cried, laughing all the while; &ldquo;if I were to be
      unfortunate enough to ask you for a proof of the affection you possess,
      how easy it would be to see that you are telling a falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, listen to me,&rdquo; said Charles, &ldquo;you know my cartoons by Raphael; you
      know whether I care for them or not; the whole world envies me their
      possession, as you well know also; my father commissioned Van Dyck to
      purchase them. Would you like me to send them to your house this very
      day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; replied the young girl; &ldquo;pray keep them yourself, sire; my house
      is far too small to accommodate such visitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case you shall have Hampton Court to put the cartoons in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be less generous, sire, and learn to love a little while longer, that is
      all I have to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never cease to love you; is not that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are smiling, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to weep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I should like to see you a little more melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven, I have been so long enough; fourteen years of exile,
      poverty, and misery, I think I may well regard it as a debt discharged;
      besides, melancholy makes people look so plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from that&mdash;for look at the young Frenchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! the Vicomte de Bragelonne? are you smitten too? By Heaven, they
      will all grow mad over him one after the other; but he, on the contrary,
      has a reason for being melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! you wish me to betray state secrets, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wish it, you must do so, for you told me you were quite ready to do
      everything I wished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, he is bored in his own country. Does that satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bored?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a proof that he is a simpleton; I allow him to fall in love with
      Miss Mary Grafton, and he feels bored. Can you believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; it seems, then, that if you were to find Miss Lucy Stewart
      indifferent to you, you would console yourself by falling in love with
      Miss Mary Grafton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that; in the first place, you know that Mary Grafton does not
      care for me; besides, a man can only console himself for a lost affection
      by the discovery of a new one. Again, however, I repeat, the question is
      not of myself, but of that young man. One might almost be tempted to call
      the girl he has left behind him a Helen&mdash;a Helen before the little
      ceremony she went through with Paris, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has left some one, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, some one has left <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow! so much the worse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you mean by &lsquo;so much the worse&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? why did he leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it was of his own wish or will that he left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he obliged to leave, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left Paris under orders, my dear Stewart; and prepare to be surprised&mdash;by
      express orders of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I begin to see, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least say nothing at all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well that I am just as discreet as anybody else. And so the
      king sent him away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And during his absence he takes his sweetheart from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and, will you believe it? the silly fellow, instead of thanking the
      king, is making himself miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! thank the king for depriving him of the woman he loves! Really,
      sire, yours is a most ungallant speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, pray understand me. If she whom the king had run off with was either
      a Miss Grafton or a Miss Stewart, I should not be of his opinion; nay, I
      should even think him not half wretched enough; but she is a little, thin,
      lame thing. Deuce take such fidelity as that! Surely, one can hardly
      understand how a man can refuse a girl who is rich for one who is poverty
      itself&mdash;a girl who loves him for one who deceives and betrays him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that Mary seriously wishes to please the vicomte, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good! the vicomte will settle down in England, for Mary has a clear
      head, and when she fixes her mind upon anything, she does so thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, my dear Miss Stewart; if the vicomte has any idea of adopting
      our country, he has not long to do so, for it was only the day before
      yesterday that he again asked me for permission to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you refused him, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so, indeed; my royal brother is far too anxious for his
      absence; and, for myself, my <i>amour propre</i> is enlisted on his side,
      for I will never have it said that I had held out as a bait to this young
      man the noblest and gentlest creature in England&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very gallant, sire,&rdquo; said Miss Stewart, with a pretty pout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not allude to Miss Stewart, for she is worthy of a king&rsquo;s devotion;
      and since she has captivated me I trust that no one else will be caught by
      her; I say, therefore, finally, that the attention I have shown this young
      man will not have been thrown away; he will stay with us here, he will
      marry here, or I am very much mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hope that when he is once married and settled, instead of being
      angry with your majesty, he will be grateful to you, for every one tries
      his utmost to please him; even the Duke of Buckingham, whose brilliancy,
      which is incredible, seems to pale before that of this young Frenchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Including Miss Stewart even, who calls him the most finished gentleman
      she ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, sire; you have spoken quite enough, and quite highly enough, of
      Miss Grafton, to overlook what I may have said about De Bragelonne. But,
      by the by, sire, your kindness for some time past astonishes me: you think
      of those who are absent, you forgive those who have done you a wrong, in
      fact, you are as nearly as possible, perfect. How does it happen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because you allow yourself to be loved,&rdquo; he said, beginning to
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there must be some other reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am doing all I can to oblige my brother, Louis XIV.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I must have another reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the true motive is that Buckingham strongly recommended the
      young man to me, saying: &lsquo;Sire, I begin by yielding up all claim to Miss
      Grafton; I pray you follow my example.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The duke is, indeed, a true gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! of course, of course; it is Buckingham&rsquo;s turn now, I suppose, to turn
      your head. You seem determined to cross me in everything to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment some one rapped at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it who presumes to interrupt us?&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sire, you are extremely vain with your &lsquo;who is it who presumes?&rsquo; 
      and in order to punish you for it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the door and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a courier from France,&rdquo; said Miss Stewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A courier from France!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles; &ldquo;from my sister, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; said the usher, &ldquo;a special messenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him come in at once,&rdquo; said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a letter for me,&rdquo; said the king to the courier as he entered,
      &ldquo;from the Duchess of Orleans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; replied the courier, &ldquo;and so urgent in its nature that I have
      only been twenty-six hours in bringing it to your majesty, and yet I lost
      three-quarters of an hour at Calais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your zeal shall not be forgotten,&rdquo; said the king, as he opened the
      letter. When he had read it he burst out laughing, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Upon my
      word, I am at a loss to understand anything about it.&rdquo; He then read the
      letter a second time, Miss Stewart assuming a manner marked by the
      greatest reserve, and doing her utmost to restrain her ardent curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis,&rdquo; said the king to his valet, &ldquo;see that this excellent fellow is
      well taken care of and sleeps soundly, and that on waking to-morrow he
      finds a purse of fifty sovereigns by his bedside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; said the courier, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begone, begone; my sister was perfectly right in desiring you to use the
      utmost diligence; the affair was most pressing.&rdquo; And he again began to
      laugh louder than ever. The courier, the valet, and Miss Stewart hardly
      knew what sort of countenance to assume. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the king, throwing
      himself back in his armchair: &ldquo;When I think that you have knocked up&mdash;how
      many horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two horses to bring this intelligence to me. That will do, you can leave
      us now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The courier retired with the valet. Charles went to the window, which he
      opened, and leaning forward, called out&mdash;&ldquo;Duke! Buckingham! come
      here, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duke hurried to him, in obedience to the summons; but when he reached
      the door, and perceived Miss Stewart, he hesitated to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, and shut the door,&rdquo; said the king. The duke obeyed; and,
      perceiving in what an excellent humor the king was, he advanced, smiling,
      towards him. &ldquo;Well, my dear duke, how do you get on with your Frenchman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I am in the most perfect state of utter despair about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because charming Miss Grafton is willing to marry him, but he is
      unwilling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he is a perfect Boeotian!&rdquo; cried Miss Stewart. &ldquo;Let him say either
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; or No,&rsquo; and let the affair end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Buckingham, seriously, &ldquo;you know, or you ought to know,
      madame, that M. de Bragelonne is in love in another direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the king, coming to Miss Stewart&rsquo;s help, &ldquo;nothing is
      easier; let him say &lsquo;No,&rsquo; then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true; and I have proved to him he was wrong not to say &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him candidly, I suppose, that La Valliere was deceiving him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, without the slightest reserve; and, as soon as I had done so, he
      gave a start, as if he were going to clear the Channel at a bound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; said Miss Stewart, &ldquo;he has done something; and a very
      good thing too, upon my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Buckingham, &ldquo;I stopped him; I have left him and Miss Mary in
      conversation together, and I sincerely trust that now he will not leave,
      as he seemed to have an idea of doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idea of leaving England?&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, at one moment, hardly thought that any human power could have
      prevented him; but Miss Mary&rsquo;s eyes are now bent fully on him, and he will
      remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is the very thing which deceives you, Buckingham,&rdquo; said the
      king, with a peal of laughter; &ldquo;the poor fellow is predestined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Predestined to what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were to be simply deceived, that is nothing; but, to look at him,
      it is a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a distance, and with Miss Grafton&rsquo;s aid, the blow will be warded off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it, far from it; neither distance nor Miss Grafton&rsquo;s help will
      be of the slightest avail. Bragelonne will set off for Paris within an
      hour&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham started, and Miss Stewart opened her eyes very wide in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sire,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;your majesty knows that it is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, my dear Buckingham, that it is impossible until it
      happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget, sire, that the young man is a perfect lion, and that his
      wrath is terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it, my dear duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that if he sees that his misfortune is certain, so much the worse for
      the author of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it; but what the deuce am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it the king himself,&rdquo; cried Buckingham, &ldquo;I would not answer for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the king has his musketeers to take care of him,&rdquo; said Charles,
      quietly; &ldquo;I know that perfectly well, for I was kept dancing attendance in
      his ante-chamber at Blois. He has M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, and what better guardian
      could the king have than M. d&rsquo;Artagnan? I should make myself perfectly
      easy with twenty storms of passion, such as Bragelonne might display, if I
      had four guardians like D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I entreat your majesty, who is so good and kind, to reflect a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Charles II., presenting the letter to the duke, &ldquo;read, and
      answer yourself what you would do in my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham slowly took hold of Madame&rsquo;s letter, and trembling with
      emotion, read the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your own sake, for mine, for the honor and safety of every one, send
      M. de Bragelonne back to France immediately. Your devoted sister,
      HENRIETTA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Villiers, what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sire, I have nothing to say,&rdquo; replied the duke, stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, would you, of all persons,&rdquo; said the king, artfully, &ldquo;advise me not
      to listen to my sister when she writes so urgently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, sire; and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not read the postscript, Villiers; it is under the fold of the
      letter, and escaped me at first; read it.&rdquo; And as the duke turned down a
      fold of the letter, he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand kind remembrances to those who love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duke&rsquo;s head sank gradually on his breast; the paper trembled in his
      fingers, as if it had been changed to lead. The king paused for a moment,
      and, seeing that Buckingham did not speak, &ldquo;He must follow his destiny, as
      we ours,&rdquo; continued the king; &ldquo;every man has his own share of grief in
      this world; I have had my own,&mdash;I have had that of others who belong
      to me,&mdash;and have thus had a double weight of woe to endure!&mdash;But
      the deuce take all my cares now! Go, and bring our friend here, Villiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duke opened the trellised door of the summer-house, and pointing at
      Raoul and Mary, who were walking together side by side, said, &ldquo;What a
      cruel blow, sire, for poor Miss Grafton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense; call him,&rdquo; said Charles II., knitting his black brows together;
      &ldquo;every one seems to be sentimental here. There, look at Miss Stewart, who
      is wiping her eyes,&mdash;now deuce take the French fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duke called to Raoul, and taking Miss Grafton by the hand, he led her
      towards the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Bragelonne,&rdquo; said Charles II., &ldquo;did you not ask me the day
      before yesterday for permission to return to Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; replied Raoul, greatly puzzled by this address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I refused you, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For which you were angry with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire; your majesty had no doubt excellent reasons for withholding it;
      for you are so wise and so good that everything you do is well done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I alleged, I believe, as a reason, that the king of France had not
      recalled you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, that was the reason you assigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, M. de Bragelonne, I have reflected over the matter since; if the
      king did not, in fact, fix your return, he begged me to render your
      sojourn in England as agreeable as possible; since, however, you ask my
      permission to return, it is because your longer residence in England is no
      longer agreeable to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say that, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but your request, at least,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;signified that another
      place of residence would be more agreeable to you than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Raoul turned towards the door, against which Miss Grafton
      was leaning, pale and sorrow-stricken; her other hand was passed through
      the duke&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not reply,&rdquo; pursued Charles; &ldquo;the proverb is plain enough, that
      &lsquo;silence gives consent.&rsquo; Very good, Monsieur de Bragelonne; I am now in a
      position to satisfy you; whenever you please, therefore, you can leave for
      Paris, for which you have my authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, while Mary stifled an exclamation of grief which
      rose to her lips, unconsciously pressing Buckingham&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can be at Dover this evening,&rdquo; continued the king, &ldquo;the tide serves
      at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, astounded, stammered out a few broken sentences, which equally
      answered the purpose both of thanks and of excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I therefore bid you adieu, Monsieur de Bragelonne, and wish you every
      sort of prosperity,&rdquo; said the king, rising; &ldquo;you will confer a pleasure on
      me by keeping this diamond in remembrance of me; I had intended it as a
      marriage gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Grafton felt her limbs almost giving way; and, as Raoul received the
      ring from the king&rsquo;s hand, he, too, felt his strength and courage failing
      him. He addressed a few respectful words to the king, a passing compliment
      to Miss Stewart, and looked for Buckingham to bid him adieu. The king
      profited by this moment to disappear. Raoul found the duke engaged in
      endeavoring to encourage Miss Grafton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to remain, I implore you!&rdquo; said Buckingham to Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will tell him to go,&rdquo; replied Miss Grafton, with returning
      animation; &ldquo;I am not one of those women who have more pride than heart; if
      she whom he loves is in France, let him return thither and bless me for
      having advised him to go and seek his happiness there. If, on the
      contrary, she shall have ceased to love him, let him come back here again;
      I shall still love him, and his unhappiness will not have lessened him in
      my regard. In the arms of my house you will find that which Heaven has
      engraven on my heart&mdash;<i>Habenti parum, egenti cuncta</i>. &lsquo;To the
      rich is accorded little, to the poor everything.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe, Bragelonne, that you will find yonder the equivalent of
      what you leave behind you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, or at least hope,&rdquo; said Raoul, with a gloomy air, &ldquo;that she whom
      I love is worthy of my affection; but if it be true she is unworthy of me,
      as you have endeavored to make me believe, I will tear her image from my
      heart, duke, even if my heart breaks in the attempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Grafton gazed upon him with an expression of the most indefinable
      pity, and Raoul returned her look with a sweet, sorrowful smile, saying,
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, the diamond which the king has given me was destined for
      you,&mdash;give me leave to offer it for your acceptance: if I marry in
      France, you will send it me back; if I do not marry, keep it.&rdquo; And he
      bowed and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; thought Buckingham, while Raoul pressed Mary&rsquo;s icy
      hand with marks of the most reverential respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary understood the look that Buckingham fixed upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were a wedding-ring, I would not accept it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you were willing to ask him to return to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! duke,&rdquo; cried the young girl in heart-broken accents, &ldquo;a woman such as
      I am is never accepted as a consolation by a man like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not think he will return, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Miss Grafton, in a choking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I grieve to tell you, Mary, that he will find yonder his happiness
      destroyed, his mistress lost to him. His honor even has not escaped. What
      will be left him, then, Mary, equal to your affection? Answer, Mary, you
      who know yourself so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Grafton placed her white hand on Buckingham&rsquo;s arm, and, while Raoul
      was hurrying away with headlong speed, she repeated in dying accents the
      line from Romeo and Juliet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I must be gone and live, or stay and die</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she finished the last word, Raoul disappeared. Miss Grafton returned to
      her own apartments, paler than death. Buckingham availed himself of the
      arrival of the courier, who had brought the letter to the king, to write
      to Madame and to the Comte de Guiche. The king had not been mistaken, for
      at two in the morning the tide was at full flood, and Raoul had embarked
      for France.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIX. Saint-Aignan Follows Malicorne&rsquo;s Advice.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king most assiduously followed the progress which was made in La
      Valliere&rsquo;s portrait; and did so with a care and attention arising as much
      from a desire that it should resemble her as from the wish that the
      painter should prolong the period of its completion as much as possible.
      It was amusing to observe him follow the artist&rsquo;s brush, awaiting the
      completion of a particular plan, or the result of a combination of colors,
      and suggesting various modifications to the painter, which the latter
      consented to adopt with the most respectful docility. And again, when the
      artist, following Malicorne&rsquo;s advice, was a little late in arriving, and
      when Saint-Aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time, it was
      interesting to observe, though no one witnessed them, those moments of
      silence full of deep expression, which united in one sigh two souls most
      disposed to understand each other, and who by no means objected to the
      quiet meditation they enjoyed together. The minutes flew rapidly by, as if
      on wings, and as the king drew closer to Louise and bent his burning gaze
      upon her, a noise was suddenly heard in the ante-room. It was the artist,
      who had just arrived; Saint-Aignan, too, had returned, full of apologies;
      and the king began to talk and La Valliere to answer him very hurriedly,
      their eyes revealing to Saint-Aignan that they had enjoyed a century of
      happiness during his absence. In a word, Malicorne, philosopher that he
      was, though he knew it not, had learned how to inspire the king with an
      appetite in the midst of plenty, and with desire in the assurance of
      possession. La Valliere&rsquo;s fears of interruption had never been realized,
      and no one imagined she was absent from her apartment two or three hours
      every day; she pretended that her health was very uncertain; those who
      went to her room always knocked before entering, and Malicorne, the man of
      so many ingenious inventions, had constructed an acoustic piece of
      mechanism, by means of which La Valliere, when in Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s
      apartment, was always forewarned of any visits which were paid to the room
      she usually inhabited. In this manner, therefore, without leaving her
      room, and having no <i>confidante</i>, she was able to return to her
      apartment, thus removing by her appearance, a little tardy perhaps, the
      suspicions of the most determined skeptics. Malicorne having asked
      Saint-Aignan the next morning what news he had to report, the latter was
      obliged to confess that the quarter of an hour&rsquo;s liberty had made the king
      in most excellent humor. &ldquo;We must double the dose,&rdquo; replied Malicorne,
      &ldquo;but by insensible degrees; wait until they seem to wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were so desirous for it, however, that on the evening of the fourth
      day, at the moment when the painter was packing up his implements, during
      Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s continued absence, Saint-Aignan on his return noticed upon
      La Valliere&rsquo;s face a shade of disappointment and vexation, which she could
      not conceal. The king was less reserved, and exhibited his annoyance by a
      very significant shrug of the shoulders, at which La Valliere could not
      help blushing. &ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; thought Saint-Aignan to himself; &ldquo;M. Malicorne
      will be delighted this evening;&rdquo; as he, in fact, was, when it was reported
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very evident,&rdquo; he remarked to the comte, &ldquo;that Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere hoped that you would be at least ten minutes later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king that I should be half an hour later, dear Monsieur
      Malicorne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would show but very indifferent devotion to the king,&rdquo; replied the
      latter, &ldquo;if you were to refuse his majesty that half-hour&rsquo;s satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the painter,&rdquo; objected Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> will take care of him,&rdquo; said Malicorne, &ldquo;only I must study faces
      and circumstances a little better before I act; those are my magical
      inventions and contrivances; and while sorcerers are enabled by means of
      their astrolabe to take the altitude of the sun, moon, and stars, I am
      satisfied merely by looking into people&rsquo;s faces, in order to see if their
      eyes are encircled with dark lines, and if the mouth describes a convex or
      concave arc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the cunning Malicorne had every opportunity of watching narrowly and
      closely, for the very same evening the king accompanied the queen to
      Madame&rsquo;s apartments, and made himself so remarked by his serious face and
      his deep sigh, and looked at La Valliere with such a languishing
      expression, that Malicorne said to Montalais during the evening:
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo; And he went off to the painter&rsquo;s house in the street of the
      Jardins Saint-Paul to request him to postpone the next sitting for a
      couple of days. Saint-Aignan was not within, when La Valliere, who was now
      quite familiar with the lower story, lifted up the trap-door and
      descended. The king, as usual was waiting for her on the staircase, and
      held a bouquet in his hand; as soon as he saw her, he clasped her tenderly
      in his arms. La Valliere, much moved at the action, looked around the
      room, but as she saw the king was alone, she did not complain of it. They
      sat down, the king reclining near the cushions on which Louise was seated,
      with his head supported by her knees, placed there as in an asylum whence
      no one could banish him; he gazed ardently upon her, and as if the moment
      had arrived when nothing could interpose between their two hearts; she,
      too, gazed with similar passion upon him, and from her eyes, so softly
      pure, emanated a flame, whose rays first kindled and then inflamed the
      heart of the king, who, trembling with happiness as Louise&rsquo;s hand rested
      on his head, grew giddy from excess of joy, and momentarily awaited either
      the painter&rsquo;s or Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s return to break the sweet illusion. But
      the door remained closed, and neither Saint-Aignan nor the painter
      appeared, nor did the hangings even move. A deep mysterious silence
      reigned in the room&mdash;a silence which seemed to influence even the
      song-birds in their gilded prisons. The king, completely overcome, turned
      round his head and buried his burning lips in La Valliere&rsquo;s hands, who,
      herself faint, with excess of emotion, pressed her trembling hands against
      her lover&rsquo;s lips. Louis threw himself upon his knees, and as La Valliere
      did not move her head, the king&rsquo;s forehead being within reach of her lips,
      she furtively passed her lips across the perfumed locks which caressed her
      cheeks. The king seized her in his arms, and, unable to resist the
      temptation, they exchanged their first kiss, that burning kiss, which
      changes love into delirium. Suddenly, a noise upon the upper floor was
      heard, which had, in fact, continued, though it had remained unnoticed,
      for some time; it had at last aroused La Valliere&rsquo;s attention, though but
      slowly so. As the noise, however, continued, as it forced itself upon the
      attention, and recalled the poor girl from her dreams of happiness to the
      sad realities of life, she rose in a state of utter bewilderment, though
      beautiful in her disorder, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one is waiting for me above. Louis, Louis, do you not hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! and am I not waiting for you, also?&rdquo; said the king, with infinite
      tenderness of tone. &ldquo;Let others henceforth wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she gently shook her head, as she replied: &ldquo;Happiness hidden... power
      concealed... my pride should be as silent as my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise was again resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear Montalais&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; she said, and she hurried up the staircase;
      the king followed her, unable to let her leave his sight, and covering her
      hand with his kisses. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; repeated La Valliere, who had passed
      half-way through the opening. &ldquo;Yes, it is Montalais who is calling me;
      something important must have happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go then, dearest love,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;but return quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not to-day, sire! Adieu! adieu!&rdquo; she said, as she stooped down
      once more to embrace her lover&mdash;and escaped. Montalais was, in fact,
      waiting for her, very pale and agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, quick! <i>he</i> is coming,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who is coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul,&rdquo; murmured Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I&mdash;I,&rdquo; said a joyous voice, upon the last steps of the grand
      staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere uttered a terrible shriek and threw herself back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, dear Louise,&rdquo; said Raoul, running towards her. &ldquo;I knew but too
      well that you had not ceased to love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere with a gesture, partly of extreme terror, and partly as if
      invoking a blessing, attempted to speak, but could not articulate one
      word. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she said, as she fell into Montalais&rsquo;s arms, murmuring,
      &ldquo;Do not touch me, do not come near me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montalais made a sign to Raoul, who stood almost petrified at the door,
      and did not even attempt to advance another step into the room. Then,
      looking towards the side of the room where the screen was, she exclaimed:
      &ldquo;Imprudent girl, she has not even closed the trap-door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she advanced towards the corner of the room to close the screen, and
      also, behind the screen, the trap-door. But suddenly the king, who had
      heard Louise&rsquo;s exclamation, darted through the opening, and hurried
      forward to her assistance. He threw himself on his knees before her, as he
      overwhelmed Montalais with questions, who hardly knew where she was. At
      the moment, however, when the king threw himself on his knees, a cry of
      utter despair rang through the corridor, accompanied by the sound of
      retreating footsteps. The king wished to see who had uttered the cry and
      whose were the footsteps he had heard; and it was in vain that Montalais
      sought to retain him, for Louis, quitting his hold of La Valliere, hurried
      towards the door, too late, however, for Raoul was already at a distance,
      and the king only beheld a shadow that quickly vanished in the silent
      corridor. <a href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a>

    <h2>
      Chapter XL: Two Old Friends.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whilst every one at court was busily engaged with his own affairs, a man
      mysteriously took up his post behind the Place de Greve, in the house
      which we once saw besieged by D&rsquo;Artagnan on the occasion of the <i>emeute</i>.
      The principal entrance of the house was in the Place Baudoyer; it was
      tolerably large, surrounded by gardens, inclosed in the Rue Saint-Jean by
      the shops of toolmakers, which protected it from prying looks, and was
      walled in by a triple rampart of stone, noise, and verdure, like an
      embalmed mummy in its triple coffin. The man we have just alluded to
      walked along with a firm step, although he was no longer in his early
      prime. His dark cloak and long sword plainly revealed one who seemed in
      search of adventures; and, judging from his curling mustache, his fine
      smooth skin, which could be seen beneath his <i>sombrero</i>, it would not
      have been difficult to pronounce that gallantry had not a little share in
      his adventures. In fact, hardly had the cavalier entered the house, when
      the clock struck eight; and ten minutes afterwards a lady, followed by a
      servant armed to the teeth, approached and knocked at the same door, which
      an old woman immediately opened for her. The lady raised her veil as she
      entered; though no longer beautiful or young, she was still active and of
      an imposing carriage. She concealed, beneath a rich toilette and the most
      exquisite taste, an age which Ninon de l&rsquo;Enclos alone could have smiled at
      with impunity. Hardly had she reached the vestibule, when the cavalier,
      whose features we have only roughly sketched, advanced towards her,
      holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, my dear duchesse,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, my dear Aramis?&rdquo; replied the duchesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her to a most elegantly furnished apartment, on whose high windows
      were reflected the expiring rays of the setting sun, which filtered
      gaudily through the dark green needles of the adjacent firs. They sat down
      side by side. Neither of them thought of asking for additional light in
      the room, and they buried themselves as it were in the shadow, as if they
      wished to bury themselves in forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chevalier,&rdquo; said the duchesse, &ldquo;you have never given me a single sign of
      life since our interview at Fontainebleau, and I confess that your
      presence there on the day of the Franciscan&rsquo;s death, and your initiation
      in certain secrets, caused me the liveliest astonishment I ever
      experienced in my whole life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can explain my presence there to you, as well as my initiation,&rdquo; said
      Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let us, first of all,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;talk a little of ourselves,
      for our friendship is by no means of recent date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame: and if Heaven wills it, we shall continue to be friends, I
      will not say for a long time, but forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite certain, chevalier, and my visit is a proof of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our interests, duchess, are no longer the same as they used to be,&rdquo; said
      Aramis, smiling without apprehension in the growing gloom by which the
      room was overcast, for it could not reveal that his smile was less
      agreeable and not so bright as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, chevalier, at the present day we have other interests. Every period
      of life brings its own; and, as we now understand each other in
      conversing, as perfectly as we formerly did without saying a word, let us
      talk, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your orders, duchesse. Ah! I beg your pardon, how did you obtain
      my address, and what was your object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me why? I have told you. Curiosity in the first place. I wished
      to know what you could have to do with the Franciscan, with whom I had
      certain business transactions, and who died so singularly. You know that
      on the occasion of our interview at Fontainebleau, in the cemetery, at the
      foot of the grave so recently closed, we were both so much overcome by our
      emotions that we omitted to confide to each other what we may have to
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I had no sooner left you than I repented, and have ever since
      been most anxious to ascertain the truth. You know that Madame de
      Longueville and myself are almost one, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware,&rdquo; said Aramis, discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remembered, therefore,&rdquo; continued the duchesse, &ldquo;that neither of us
      said anything to the other in the cemetery; that you did not speak of the
      relationship in which you stood to the Franciscan, whose burial you
      superintended, and that I did not refer to the position in which I stood
      to him; all which seemed very unworthy of two such old friends as
      ourselves, and I have sought an opportunity of an interview with you in
      order to give you some information that I have recently acquired, and to
      assure you that Marie Michon, now no more, has left behind her one who has
      preserved her recollection of events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis bowed over the duchess&rsquo;s hand, and pressed his lips upon it. &ldquo;You
      must have had some trouble to find me again,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, annoyed to find the subject taking a turn which
      Aramis wished to give it; &ldquo;but I knew you were a friend of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s,
      and so I inquired in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend! oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the chevalier, &ldquo;I can hardly pretend to be <i>that</i>.
      A poor priest who has been favored by a generous protector, and whose
      heart is full of gratitude and devotion, is all that I pretend to be to M.
      Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made you a bishop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good retiring pension for so handsome a musketeer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in the same way that political intrigue is for yourself,&rdquo; thought
      Aramis. &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you inquired after me at M. Fouquet&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily enough. You had been to Fontainebleau with him, and had undertaken
      a voyage to your diocese, which is Belle-Ile-en-Mer, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;My diocese is Vannes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant that. I only thought that Belle-Ile-en-Mer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is a property belonging to M. Fouquet, nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I had been told that Belle-Isle was fortified; besides, I know how
      great the military knowledge is you possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten everything of the kind since I entered the Church,&rdquo; said
      Aramis, annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffice it to know that I learned you had returned from Vannes, and I
      sent off to one of our friends, M. le Comte de la Fere, who is discretion
      itself, in order to ascertain it, but he answered that he was not aware of
      your address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So like Athos,&rdquo; thought the bishop; &ldquo;the really good man never changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you know that I cannot venture to show myself here, and that
      the queen-mother has always some grievance or other against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, and I am surprised at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there are various reasons for it. But, to continue, being obliged to
      conceal myself, I was fortunate enough to meet with M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, who was
      formerly one of your old friends, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of mine still, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave me certain information, and sent me to M. Baisemeaux, the
      governor of the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis was somewhat agitated at this remark, and a light flashed from his
      eyes in the darkness of the room, which he could not conceal from his
      keen-sighted friend. &ldquo;M. de Baisemeaux!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why did D&rsquo;Artagnan send
      you to M. de Baisemeaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can this possibly mean?&rdquo; said the bishop, summoning all the
      resources of his mind to his aid, in order to carry on the combat in a
      befitting manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Baisemeaux is greatly indebted to you, D&rsquo;Artagnan told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, he is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the address of a creditor is as easily ascertained as that of a
      debtor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true; and so Baisemeaux indicated to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint-Mande, where I forwarded a letter to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I have in my hand, and which is most precious to me,&rdquo; said Aramis,
      &ldquo;because I am indebted to it for the pleasure of seeing you here.&rdquo; The
      duchesse, satisfied at having successfully overcome the various
      difficulties of so delicate an explanation, began to breathe freely again,
      which Aramis, however, could not succeed in doing. &ldquo;We had got as far as
      your visit to M. Baisemeaux, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she said, laughing, &ldquo;farther than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case we must have been speaking about the grudge you have against
      the queen-mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Further still,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;further still; we were talking of the
      connection&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which existed between you and the Franciscan,&rdquo; said Aramis, interrupting
      her eagerly, &ldquo;well, I am listening to you very attentively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easily explained,&rdquo; returned the duchesse. &ldquo;You know that I am
      living at Brussels with M. de Laicques?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that my children have ruined and stripped me of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How terrible, dear duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible indeed; this obliged me to resort to some means of obtaining a
      livelihood, and, particularly, to avoid vegetating for the remainder of my
      existence. I had old hatreds to turn to account, old friendships to make
      use of; I no longer had either credit or protectors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i>, who had extended protection towards so many persons,&rdquo; said
      Aramis, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always the case, chevalier. Well, at the present time I am in the
      habit of seeing the king of Spain very frequently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has just nominated a general of the Jesuits, according to the usual
      custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it usual, indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you not aware of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; I was inattentive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be aware of that&mdash;you who were on such good terms with the
      Franciscan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the general of the Jesuits, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Well, then, I have seen the king of Spain, who wished to do me a
      service, but was unable. He gave me recommendations, however, to Flanders,
      both for myself and for Laicques too; and conferred a pension on me out of
      the funds belonging to the order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Jesuits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The general&mdash;I mean the Franciscan&mdash;was sent to me; and,
      for the purpose of conforming with the requisitions of the statues of the
      order, and of entitling me to the pension, I was reputed to be in a
      position to render certain services. You are aware that that is the rule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not know it,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Chevreuse paused to look at Aramis, but it was perfectly dark.
      &ldquo;Well, such is the rule, however,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;I had, therefore, to
      appear to possess a power of usefulness of some kind or other, and I
      proposed to travel for the order, and I was placed on the list of
      affiliated travelers. You understand it was a formality, by means of which
      I received my pension, which was very convenient for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! duchesse, what you tell me is like a dagger-thrust. <i>You</i>
      obliged to receive a pension from the Jesuits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, chevalier! from Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except for a conscientious scruple, duchesse, you will admit that it is
      pretty nearly the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely of your magnificent fortune there must remain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dampierre is all that remains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is handsome enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but Dampierre is burdened, mortgaged, and almost fallen to ruin,
      like its owner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can the queen-mother know and see all that, without shedding a tear?&rdquo;
       said Aramis, with a penetrating look, which encountered nothing but
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She has forgotten everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, I believe, attempted to get restored to favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but, most singularly, the young king inherits the antipathy his dear
      father had for me. You will, perhaps, tell me that I am indeed a woman to
      be hated, and that I am no longer one who can be loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear duchesse, pray come quickly to the cause that brought you here; for
      I think we can be of service to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such has been my own thought. I came to Fontainebleau with a double
      object in view. In the first place, I was summoned there by the Franciscan
      whom you knew. By the by, how did you know him?&mdash;for I have told you
      my story, and have not yet heard yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him in a very natural way, duchesse. I studied theology with him
      at Parma. We became fast friends; and it happened, from time to time, that
      business, or travel, or war, separated us from each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were, of course, aware that he was the general of the Jesuits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But by what extraordinary chance did it happen that you were at the hotel
      when the affiliated travelers met together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Aramis, in a calm voice, &ldquo;it was the merest chance in the
      world. I was going to Fontainebleau to see M. Fouquet, for the purpose of
      obtaining an audience of the king. I was passing by, unknown; I saw the
      poor dying monk in the road, and recognized him immediately. You know the
      rest&mdash;he died in my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but bequeathing to you so vast a power that you issue your sovereign
      orders and directions like a monarch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly did leave me a few commissions to settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you&mdash;a sum of twelve thousand livres was to be paid to
      you. I thought I had given you the necessary signature to enable you to
      receive it. Did you not get the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, yes. You give your orders, I am informed, with so much mystery,
      and such a majestic presence, that it is generally believed you are the
      successor of the defunct chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis colored impatiently, and the duchesse continued: &ldquo;I have obtained
      my information,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;from the king of Spain himself; and he cleared
      up some of my doubts on the point. Every general of the Jesuits is
      nominated by him, and must be a Spaniard, according to the statutes of the
      order. You are not a Spaniard, nor have you been nominated by the king of
      Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis did not reply to this remark, except to say, &ldquo;You see, duchesse,
      how greatly you were mistaken, since the king of Spain told you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear Aramis; but there was something else which I have been
      thinking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, I believe, something about most things, and it occurred to me
      that you know the Spanish language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every Frenchman who has been actively engaged in the Fronde knows
      Spanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lived in Flanders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have stayed at Madrid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in a position, then, to become a naturalized Spaniard, when you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Aramis, with a frankness which deceived the duchesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. Two years&rsquo; residence and an acquaintance with the language
      are indispensable. You have upwards of four years&mdash;more than double
      the time necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you driving at, duchesse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this&mdash;I am on good terms with the king of Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am not on bad terms,&rdquo; thought Aramis to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ask the king,&rdquo; continued the duchesse, &ldquo;to confer the succession
      to the Franciscan&rsquo;s post upon you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, duchesse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have it already, perhaps?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, upon my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, I can render you that service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not render the same service to M. de Laicques, duchesse? He
      is a very talented man, and one you love, besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, no doubt; but, at all events, putting Laicques aside, will you have
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. &ldquo;He is nominated,&rdquo; she thought; and then resumed aloud, &ldquo;If
      you refuse me in this manner, it is not very encouraging for me, supposing
      I should have something to ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! ask, pray, ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask! I cannot do so, if you have not the power to grant what I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However limited my power and ability, ask all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need a sum of money, to restore Dampierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied Aramis, coldly&mdash;&ldquo;money? Well, duchesse, how much would
      you require?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a tolerably round sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse&mdash;you know I am not rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; but the order is&mdash;and if you had been the general&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I am not the general, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, you have a friend who must be very wealthy&mdash;M.
      Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet! He is more than half ruined, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is said, but I did not believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, duchesse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have, or rather Laicques has, certain letters in his possession
      from Cardinal Mazarin, which establish the existence of very strange
      accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What accounts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relative to various sums of money borrowed and disposed of. I cannot very
      distinctly remember what they are; but they establish the fact that the
      superintendent, according to these letters, which are signed by Mazarin,
      had taken thirteen millions of francs from the coffers of the state. The
      case is a very serious one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis clenched his hands in anxiety and apprehension. &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;that you have such letters as you speak of, and have not
      communicated them to M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the duchesse, &ldquo;I keep such trifling matters as these in
      reserve. The day may come when they will be of service; and they can be
      withdrawn from the safe custody in which they now remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that day has arrived?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are going to show those letters to M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to talk about them with you, instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be in sad want of money, my poor friend, to think of such things
      as these&mdash;you, too, who held M. de Mazarin&rsquo;s prose effusions in such
      indifferent esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, I am in want of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; continued Aramis, in cold accents, &ldquo;it must have been very
      distressing to you to be obliged to have recourse to such a means. It is
      cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if had wished to do harm instead of good,&rdquo; said Madame de Chevreuse,
      &ldquo;instead of asking the general of the order, or M. Fouquet, for the five
      hundred thousand francs I require, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Five hundred thousand francs!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; no more. Do you think it much? I require at least as much as that to
      restore Dampierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, therefore, that instead of asking for this amount, I should have
      gone to see my old friend the queen-mother; the letters from her husband,
      Signor Mazarini, would have served me as an introduction, and I should
      have begged this mere trifle of her, saying to her, &lsquo;I wish, madame, to
      have the honor of receiving you at Dampierre. Permit me to put Dampierre
      in a fit state for that purpose.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis did not return a single word. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what are you
      thinking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am making certain additions,&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. Fouquet subtractions. I, on the other hand, am trying my hand at
      the art of multiplication. What excellent calculators we all three are!
      How well we might understand one another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you allow me to reflect?&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for with such an opening between people like ourselves, &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; 
      is the only answer, and that an immediate one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a snare,&rdquo; thought the bishop; &ldquo;it is impossible that Anne of
      Austria would listen to such a woman as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the duchesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, I should be very much astonished if M. Fouquet had five
      hundred thousand francs at his disposal at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no use speaking of it, then,&rdquo; said the duchesse, &ldquo;and Dampierre
      must get restored how best it may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are not embarrassed to such an extent as that, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am never embarrassed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the queen,&rdquo; continued the bishop, &ldquo;will certainly do for you what the
      superintendent is unable to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly. But tell me, do you think it would be better that I should
      speak, myself, to M. Fouquet about these letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, duchesse, you will do precisely whatever you please in that respect.
      M. Fouquet either feels or does not feel himself to be guilty; if he
      really be so, I know he is proud enough not to confess it; if he be not
      so, he will be exceedingly offended at your menace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As usual, you reason like an angel,&rdquo; said the duchesse, as she rose from
      her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, you are now going to denounce M. Fouquet to the queen,&rdquo; said
      Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Denounce!&rsquo; Oh! what a disagreeable word. I shall not &lsquo;denounce&rsquo; my dear
      friend; you know matters of policy too well to be ignorant how easily
      these affairs are arranged. I shall merely side against M. Fouquet, and
      nothing more; and, in a war of party against party, a weapon is always a
      weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And once on friendly terms again with the queen-mother, I may be
      dangerous towards some persons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are at liberty to prove so, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A liberty of which I shall avail myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not ignorant, I suppose, duchesse, that M. Fouquet is on the best
      terms with the king of Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, therefore, you begin a party warfare against M. Fouquet, he will
      reply in the same way; for he, too, is at perfect liberty to do so, is he
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as he is on good terms with Spain, he will make use of that
      friendship as a weapon of attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, that he is, naturally, on good terms with the general of the
      order of the Jesuits, my dear Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be the case, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that, consequently, the pension I have been receiving from the order
      will be stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am greatly afraid it might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; I must contrive to console myself in the best way I can; for after
      Richelieu, after the Fronde, after exile, what is there left for Madame de
      Chevreuse to be afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pension, you are aware, is forty-eight thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I am quite aware of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, in party contests, you know, the friends of one&rsquo;s enemy do not
      escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you mean that poor Laicques will have to suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is almost inevitable, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he only receives twelve thousand francs pension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the king of Spain has some influence left; advised by M.
      Fouquet, he might get M. Laicques shut up in prison for a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not very nervous on that point, my dear friend; because, once
      reconciled with Anne of Austria, I will undertake that France would insist
      upon M. Laicques&rsquo;s liberation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. In that case, you will have something else to apprehend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can that be?&rdquo; said the duchesse, pretending to be surprised and
      terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will learn; indeed, you must know it already, that having once been
      an affiliated member of the order, it is not easy to leave it; for the
      secrets that any particular member may have acquired are unwholesome, and
      carry with them the germs of misfortune for whosoever may reveal them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchesse paused and reflected for a moment, and then said, &ldquo;That is
      more serious: I will think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And notwithstanding the profound obscurity, Aramis seemed to feel a
      basilisk glance, like a white-hot iron, escape from his friend&rsquo;s eyes, and
      plunge into his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us recapitulate,&rdquo; said Aramis, determined to keep himself on his
      guard, and gliding his hand into his breast where he had a dagger
      concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, let us recapitulate; short accounts make long friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The suppression of your pension&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty-eight thousand francs, and that of Laicques&rsquo;s twelve, make together
      sixty thousand francs; that is what you mean, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; and I was trying to find out what would be your equivalent for
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred thousand francs, which I shall get from the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, which you will <i>not</i> get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a means of procuring them,&rdquo; said the duchesse, thoughtlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark made the chevalier prick up his ears; and from the moment his
      adversary had committed this error, his mind was so thoroughly on its
      guard, that he seemed every moment to gain the advantage more and more;
      and she, consequently, to lose it. &ldquo;I will admit, for argument&rsquo;s sake,
      that you obtain the money,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;you will lose twice as much,
      having a hundred thousand francs&rsquo; pension to receive instead of sixty
      thousand, and that for a period of ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, for I shall only be subjected to this reduction of my income
      during the period of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s remaining in power, a period which I
      estimate at two months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am frank, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for it, duchesse; but you would be wrong to suppose that
      after M. Fouquet&rsquo;s disgrace the order would resume the payment of your
      pension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a means of making the order pay, as I know a means of forcing the
      queen-mother to concede what I require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, duchesse, we are all obliged to strike our flags to you.
      The victory is yours, and the triumph also. Be clement, I entreat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it possible,&rdquo; resumed the duchesse, without taking notice of the
      irony, &ldquo;that you really draw back from a miserable sum of five hundred
      thousand francs, when it is a question of sparing you&mdash;I mean your
      friend&mdash;I beg your pardon, I ought rather to say your protector&mdash;the
      disagreeable consequences which a party contest produces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duchesse, I tell you why; supposing the five hundred thousand francs were
      to be given you, M. Laicques will require his share, which will be another
      five hundred thousand francs, I presume? and then, after M. de Laicques&rsquo;s
      and your own portions have been arranged, the portions which your
      children, your poor pensioners, and various other persons will require,
      will start up as fresh claims, and these letters, however compromising
      they may be in their nature, are not worth from three to four millions.
      Can you have forgotten the queen of France&rsquo;s diamonds?&mdash;they were
      surely worth more than these bits of waste paper signed by Mazarin, and
      yet their recovery did not cost a fourth part of what you ask for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is true; but the merchant values his goods at his own price,
      and it is for the purchaser to buy or refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a moment, duchesse; would you like me to tell you why I will not buy
      your letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the letters you claim to be Mazarin&rsquo;s are false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an absurdity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it, for it would, to say the least, be very singular,
      that after you had quarreled with the queen through M. Mazarin&rsquo;s means,
      you should have kept up any intimate acquaintance with the latter; it
      would look as if you had been acting as a spy; and upon my word, I do not
      like to make use of the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! pray do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You great complacence would seem suspicions, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite true; but the contents of the letters are even more so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pledge you my word, duchesse, that you will not be able to make use of
      it with the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, indeed; I can make use of everything with the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; thought Aramis. &ldquo;Croak on, old owl&mdash;hiss,
      beldame-viper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the duchesse had said enough, and advanced a few steps towards the
      door. Aramis, however, had reserved one exposure which she did <i>not</i>
      expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell, candles immediately appeared in the adjoining room, and
      the bishop found himself completely encircled by lights, which shone upon
      the worn, haggard face of the duchesse, revealing every feature but too
      clearly. Aramis fixed a long ironical look upon her pale, thin, withered
      cheeks&mdash;her dim, dull eyes&mdash;and upon her lips, which she kept
      carefully closed over her discolored scanty teeth. He, however, had thrown
      himself into a graceful attitude, with his haughty and intelligent head
      thrown back; he smiled so as to reveal teeth still brilliant and dazzling.
      The antiquated coquette understood the trick that had been played her. She
      was standing immediately before a large mirror, in which her decrepitude,
      so carefully concealed, was only made more manifest. And, thereupon,
      without even saluting Aramis, who bowed with the ease and grace of the
      musketeer of early days, she hurried away with trembling steps, which her
      very precipitation only the more impeded. Aramis sprang across the room,
      like a zephyr, to lead her to the door. Madame de Chevreuse made a sign to
      her servant, who resumed his musket, and she left the house where such
      tender friends had not been able to understand each other only because
      they had understood each other too well.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLI. Wherein May Be Seen that a Bargain Which Cannot Be Made with
      One Person, Can Be Carried Out with Another.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aramis had been perfectly correct in his supposition; for hardly had she
      left the house in the Place Baudoyer than Madame de Chevreuse proceeded
      homeward. She was doubtless afraid of being followed, and by this means
      thought she might succeed in throwing those who might be following her off
      their guard; but scarcely had she arrived within the door of the hotel,
      and hardly had assured herself that no one who could cause her any
      uneasiness was on her track, when she opened the door of the garden,
      leading into another street, and hurried towards the Rue Croix des
      Petits-Champs, where M. Colbert resided.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already said that evening, or rather night, had closed in; it was
      a dark, thick night, besides; Paris had once more sunk into its calm,
      quiescent state, enshrouding alike within its indulgent mantle the
      high-born duchesse carrying out her political intrigue, and the simple
      citizen&rsquo;s wife, who, having been detained late by a supper in the city,
      was making her way slowly homewards, hanging on the arm of a lover, by the
      shortest possible route. Madame de Chevreuse had been too well accustomed
      to nocturnal political intrigues to be ignorant that a minister never
      denies himself, even at his own private residence, to any young and
      beautiful woman who may chance to object to the dust and confusion of a
      public office, or to old women, as full of experience as of years, who
      dislike the indiscreet echo of official residences. A valet received the
      duchesse under the peristyle, and received her, it must be admitted, with
      some indifference of manner; he intimated, after having looked at her
      face, that it was hardly at such an hour that one so advanced in years as
      herself could be permitted to disturb Monsieur Colbert&rsquo;s important
      occupations. But Madame de Chevreuse, without looking or appearing to be
      annoyed, wrote her name upon a leaf of her tablets&mdash;a name which had
      but too frequently sounded so disagreeably in the ears of Louis XIII. and
      of the great cardinal. She wrote her name in the large, ill-formed
      characters of the higher classes of that period, handed it to the valet,
      without uttering a word, but with so haughty and imperious a gesture, that
      the fellow, well accustomed to judge of people from their manners and
      appearance, perceived at once the quality of the person before him, bowed
      his head, and ran to M. Colbert&rsquo;s room. The minister could not control a
      sudden exclamation as he opened the paper; and the valet, gathering from
      it the interest with which his master regarded the mysterious visitor,
      returned as fast as he could to beg the duchesse to follow him. She
      ascended to the first floor of the beautiful new house very slowly, rested
      herself on the landing-place, in order not to enter the apartment out of
      breath, and appeared before M. Colbert, who, with his own hands, held both
      the folding doors open. The duchesse paused at the threshold, for the
      purpose of well studying the character of the man with whom she was about
      to converse. At the first glance, the round, large, heavy head, thick
      brows, and ill-favored features of Colbert, who wore, thrust low down on
      his head, a cap like a priest&rsquo;s <i>calotte</i>, seemed to indicate that
      but little difficulty was likely to be met with in her negotiations with
      him, but also that she was to expect as little interest in the discussion
      of particulars; for there was scarcely any indication that the rough and
      uncouth nature of the man was susceptible to the impulses of a refined
      revenge, or of an exalted ambition. But when, on closer inspection, the
      duchesse perceived the small, piercingly black eyes, the longitudinal
      wrinkles of his high and massive forehead, the imperceptible twitching of
      the lips, on which were apparent traces of rough good-humor, Madame de
      Chevreuse altered her opinion of him, and felt she could say to herself:
      &ldquo;I have found the man I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the subject, madame, which procures me the honor of a visit from
      you?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The need I have of you, monsieur,&rdquo; returned the duchesse, &ldquo;as well as
      that which you have of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted, madame, with the first portion of your sentence; but, as
      far as the second portion is concerned&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Chevreuse sat down in the armchair which M. Colbert advanced
      towards her. &ldquo;Monsieur Colbert, you are the intendant of finances, and are
      ambitious of becoming the superintendent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, do not deny it; that would only unnecessarily prolong our
      conversation, and that is useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, madame, however well-disposed and inclined to show politeness I
      may be towards a lady of your position and merit, nothing will make me
      confess that I have ever entertained the idea of supplanting my superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing about supplanting, Monsieur Colbert. Could I accidentally
      have made use of that word? I hardly think that likely. The word &lsquo;replace&rsquo; 
      is less aggressive in its signification, and more grammatically suitable,
      as M. de Voiture would say. I presume, therefore, that you are ambitious
      of replacing M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet&rsquo;s fortune, madame, enables him to withstand all attempts. The
      superintendent in this age plays the part of the Colossus of Rhodes; the
      vessels pass beneath him and do not overthrow him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have availed myself precisely of that very comparison. It is
      true, M. Fouquet plays the part of the Colossus of Rhodes; but I remember
      to have heard it said by M. Conrart, a member of the academy, I believe,
      that when the Colossus of Rhodes fell from its lofty position, the
      merchant who had cast it down&mdash;a merchant, nothing more, M. Colbert&mdash;loaded
      four hundred camels with the ruins. A merchant! and that is considerably
      less than an intendant of finances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I can assure you that I shall never overthrow M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Monsieur Colbert, since you persist in showing so much
      sensitiveness with me, as if you were ignorant that I am Madame de
      Chevreuse, and also that I am somewhat advanced in years; in other words,
      that you have to do with a woman who has had political dealings with the
      Cardinal Richelieu, and who has no time to lose; as, I repeat, you do not
      hesitate to commit such an imprudence, I shall go and find others who are
      more intelligent and more desirous of making their fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, madame, how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give me a very poor idea of negotiations of the present day. I assure
      you that if, in my earlier days, a woman had gone to M. de Cinq-Mars, who
      was not, moreover, a man of a very high order of intellect, and had said
      to him about the cardinal what I have just said to you of M. Fouquet, M.
      de Cinq-Mars would by this time have already set actively to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madame, show a little indulgence, I entreat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, do you really consent to replace M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I do, if the king dismisses M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, a word too much; it is quite evident that, if you have not yet
      succeeded in driving M. Fouquet from his post, it is because you have not
      been able to do so. Therefore, I should be the greatest simpleton possible
      if, in coming to you, I did not bring the very thing you require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am distressed to be obliged to persist, madame,&rdquo; said Colbert, after a
      silence which enabled the duchesse to sound the depths of his
      dissimulation, &ldquo;but I must warn you that, for the last six years,
      denunciation after denunciation has been made against M. Fouquet, and he
      has remained unshaken and unaffected by them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a time for everything, Monsieur Colbert; those who were the
      authors of those denunciations were not called Madame de Chevreuse, and
      they had no proofs equal to the six letters from M. de Mazarin which
      establish the offense in question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The offense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The crime, if you like it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The crime! committed by M. Fouquet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing less. It is rather strange, M. Colbert, but your face, which just
      now was cold and indifferent, is now positively the very reverse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to see that it makes an impression upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because that word, madame, embraces so many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It embraces the post of superintendent of finance for yourself, and a
      letter of exile, or the Bastile, for M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, madame la duchesse, but it is almost impossible that M.
      Fouquet can be exiled; to be imprisoned or disgraced, that is already a
      great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am perfectly aware of what I am saying,&rdquo; returned Madame de
      Chevreuse, coldly. &ldquo;I do not live at such a distance from Paris as not to
      know what takes place there. The king does not like M. Fouquet, and he
      would willingly sacrifice M. Fouquet if an opportunity were only given
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a good one, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough, and one I estimate to be worth five hundred thousand
      francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, monsieur, that holding this opportunity in my own hands, I will
      not allow it to be transferred to yours except for a sum of five hundred
      thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you perfectly, madame. But since you have fixed a price for
      the sale, let me now see the value of the articles to be sold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a mere trifle; six letters, as I have already told you, from M. de
      Mazarin; and the autographs will most assuredly not be regarded as too
      highly priced, if they establish, in an irrefutable manner, that M.
      Fouquet has embezzled large sums of money from the treasury and
      appropriated them to his own purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an irrefutable manner, do you say?&rdquo; observed Colbert, whose eyes
      sparkled with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so; would you like to read the letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart! Copies, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, the copies,&rdquo; said the duchesse, as she drew from her bosom a
      small packet of papers flattened by her velvet bodice. &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colbert eagerly snatched the papers and devoured them. &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is clear enough, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame, yes; M. Mazarin must have handed the money to M. Fouquet,
      who must have kept it for his own purposes; but the question is, what
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&mdash;what money; if we come to terms I will join to these six
      letters a seventh, which will supply you with the fullest particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert reflected. &ldquo;And the originals of these letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A useless question to ask; exactly as if I were to ask you, Monsieur
      Colbert, whether the money-bags you will give me will be full or empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it concluded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for there is one circumstance to which neither of us has given any
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Fouquet can be utterly ruined, under the legal circumstances you have
      detailed, only by means of legal proceedings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A public scandal, for instance; and yet neither the legal proceedings nor
      the scandal can be commenced against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is procureur-general of the parliament; because, too, in
      France, all public administrators, the army, justice itself, and commerce,
      are intimately connected by ties of good-fellowship, which people call <i>esprit
      de corps</i>. In such a case, madame, the parliament will never permit its
      chief to be dragged before a public tribunal; and never, even if he be
      dragged there by royal authority, never, I say, will he be condemned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur Colbert, I do not see what I have to do with that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of that, madame; but I have to do with it, and it consequently
      diminishes the value of what you have brought to show me. What good can a
      proof of a crime be to me, without the possibility of obtaining a
      condemnation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if he be only suspected, M. Fouquet will lose his post of
      superintendent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; exclaimed Colbert, whose dark, gloomy features were
      momentarily lighted up by an expression of hate and vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! Monsieur Colbert,&rdquo; said the duchesse, &ldquo;forgive me, but I did not
      think you were so impressionable. Very good; in that case, since you need
      more than I have to give you, there is no occasion to speak of the matter
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame, we will go on talking of it; only, as the value of your
      commodities had decreased, you must lower your pretensions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are bargaining, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man who wishes to deal loyally is obliged to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will you offer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred thousand francs,&rdquo; said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duchesse laughed in his face, and then said, suddenly, &ldquo;Wait a moment,
      I have another arrangement to propose; will you give me three hundred
      thousand francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can either accept or refuse my terms; besides, that is not all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More still! you are becoming too impracticable to deal with, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less so than you think, perhaps, for it is not money I am going to ask
      you for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A service; you know that I have always been most affectionately attached
      to the queen, and I am desirous of having an interview with her majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur Colbert, with the queen, who is, I admit, no longer my
      friend, and who has ceased to be so for a long time past, but who may
      again become so if the opportunity be only given her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her majesty has ceased to receive any one, madame. She is a great
      sufferer, and you may be aware that the paroxysms of her disease occur
      with greater frequency than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very reason why I wish to have an interview with her majesty;
      for in Flanders there is a great variety of these kinds of complaints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, cancers&mdash;a fearful, incurable disorder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not believe that, Monsieur Colbert. The Flemish peasant is somewhat a
      man of nature, and his companion for life is not alone a wife, but a
      female laborer also; for while he is smoking his pipe, the woman works: it
      is she who draws the water from the well; she who loads the mule or the
      ass, and even bears herself a portion of the burden. Taking but little
      care of herself, she gets knocked about first in one direction, and then
      in another, and very often is beaten by her husband, and cancers
      frequently rise from contusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Flemish women do not die the sooner on that account. When they are
      great sufferers from this disease they go in search of remedies, and the
      Beguines of Bruges are excellent doctors for every kind of disease. They
      have precious waters of one sort or another; specifics of various kinds;
      and they give a bottle of it and a wax candle to the sufferer, whereby the
      priests are gainers, and Heaven is served by the disposal of both their
      wares. I will take the queen some of this holy water, which I will procure
      from the Beguines of Bruges; her majesty will recover, and will burn as
      many wax candles as she may see fit. You see, Monsieur Colbert, to prevent
      my seeing the queen is almost as bad as committing the crime of regicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are undoubtedly, madame la duchesse, a woman of exceedingly great
      abilities, and I am more than astounded at their display; still I cannot
      but suppose that this charitable consideration towards the queen in some
      measure covers a slight personal interest for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not given myself the trouble to conceal it, that I am aware of,
      Monsieur Colbert. You said, I believe, that I had a slight personal
      interest? On the contrary, it is a very great interest, and I will prove
      it to you, by resuming what I was saying. If you procure me a personal
      interview with her majesty, I will be satisfied with the three hundred
      thousand francs I have claimed; if not, I shall keep my letters, unless,
      indeed, you give me, on the spot, five hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And rising from her seat with this decisive remark, the old duchesse
      plunged M. Colbert into a disagreeable perplexity. To bargain any further
      was out of the question; and not to bargain was to pay a great deal too
      dearly for them. &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall have the pleasure of handing
      over a hundred thousand crowns; but how shall I get the actual letters
      themselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the simplest manner in the world, my dear Monsieur Colbert&mdash;whom
      will you trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The financier began to laugh, silently, so that his large eyebrows went up
      and down like the wings of a bat, upon the deep lines of his yellow
      forehead. &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely will make an exception in your own favor, Monsieur Colbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way, madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that, if you would take the trouble to accompany me to the place
      where the letters are, they would be delivered into your own hands, and
      you would be able to verify and check them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would bring the hundred thousand crowns with you at the same time,
      for I, too, do not trust any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert colored to the tips of his ears. Like all eminent men in the art
      of figures, he was of an insolent and mathematical probity. &ldquo;I will take
      with me, madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;two orders for the amount agreed upon, payable
      at my treasury. Will that satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that the orders on your treasury were for two millions, monsieur
      l&rsquo;intendant! I shall have the pleasure of showing you the way, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to order my carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a carriage below, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert coughed like an irresolute man. He imagined, for a moment, that
      the proposition of the duchesse was a snare; that perhaps some one was
      waiting at the door; and that she whose secret had just been sold to
      Colbert for a hundred thousand crowns, had already offered it to Fouquet
      for the same sum. As he still hesitated, the duchesse looked at him full
      in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You prefer your own carriage?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit I <i>do</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suppose I am going to lead you into a snare or trap of some sort or
      other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la duchesse, you have the character of being somewhat
      inconsiderate at times, as I am reputed a sober, solemn character, a jest
      or practical joke might compromise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the fact is, you are afraid. Well, then, take your own carriage, as
      many servants as you like, only think well of what I am going to say. What
      we two may arrange between ourselves, we are the only persons who will
      know&mdash;if a third person is present we might as well tell the whole
      world about it. After all, I do not make a point of it; my carriage shall
      follow yours, and I shall be satisfied to accompany you in your own
      carriage to the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the queen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten that already? Is it possible that one of the clauses
      of the agreement of so much importance to me, can have escaped you so
      soon? How trifling it seems to you, indeed; if I had known it I should
      have asked double what I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reflected, madame, and I shall not accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really&mdash;and why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have the most perfect confidence in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overpower me. But&mdash;provided I receive the hundred thousand
      crowns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are, madame,&rdquo; said Colbert, scribbling a few lines on a piece
      of paper, which he handed to the duchesse, adding, &ldquo;You are paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trait is a fine one, Monsieur Colbert, and I will reward you for it,&rdquo;
       she said, beginning to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Chevreuse&rsquo;s laugh was a very sinister sound; a man with youth,
      faith, love, life itself, throbbing in his heart, would prefer a sob to
      such a lamentable laugh. The duchesse opened the front of her dress and
      drew forth from her bosom, somewhat less white than it once had been, a
      small packet of papers, tied with a flame-colored ribbon, and, still
      laughing, she said, &ldquo;There, Monsieur Colbert, are the originals of
      Cardinal Mazarin&rsquo;s letters; they are now your own property,&rdquo; she added,
      refastening the body of her dress; &ldquo;your fortune is secured. And now
      accompany me to the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame; if you are again about to run the chance of her majesty&rsquo;s
      displeasure, and it were known at the Palais Royal that I had been the
      means of introducing you there, the queen would never forgive me while she
      lived. No; there are certain persons at the palace who are devoted to me,
      who will procure you an admission without my being compromised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you please, provided I enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you term those religious women at Bruges who cure disorders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beguines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; are you one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&mdash;but I must soon cease to be one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but I do not wish to be exposed to a refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is again your own affair, madame. I am going to give directions to
      the head valet of the gentleman in waiting on the queen to allow admission
      to a Beguine, who brings an effectual remedy for her majesty&rsquo;s sufferings.
      You are the bearer of my letter, you will undertake to be provided with
      the remedy, and will give every explanation on the subject. I admit a
      knowledge of a Beguine, but I deny all knowledge of Madame de Chevreuse.
      Here, madame, then, is your letter of introduction.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XLII. The Skin of the Bear.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Colbert handed the duchesse the letter, and gently drew aside the chair
      behind which she was standing; Madame de Chevreuse, with a very slight
      bow, immediately left the room. Colbert, who had recognized Mazarin&rsquo;s
      handwriting, and had counted the letters, rang to summon his secretary,
      whom he enjoined to go in immediate search of M. Vanel, a counselor of the
      parliament. The secretary replied that, according to his usual practice,
      M. Vanel had just that moment entered the house, in order to give the
      intendant an account of the principal details of the business which had
      been transacted during the day in parliament. Colbert approached one of
      the lamps, read the letters of the deceased cardinal over again, smiled
      repeatedly as he recognized the great value of the papers Madame de
      Chevreuse had just delivered&mdash;and burying his head in his hands for a
      few minutes, reflected profoundly. In the meantime, a tall, loosely-made
      man entered the room; his spare, thin face, steady look, and hooked nose,
      as he entered Colbert&rsquo;s cabinet, with a modest assurance of manner,
      revealed a character at once supple and decided,&mdash;supple towards the
      master who could throw him the prey, firm towards the dogs who might
      possibly be disposed to dispute its possession. M. Vanel carried a
      voluminous bundle of papers under his arm, and placed it on the desk on
      which Colbert was leaning both his elbows, as he supported his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, M. Vanel,&rdquo; said the latter, rousing himself from his
      meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Vanel, naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should say monsieur, and not monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Colbert, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We give the title of monseigneur to ministers,&rdquo; returned Vanel, with
      extreme self-possession, &ldquo;and you are a minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so in point of fact, and I call you monseigneur accordingly;
      besides you are seigneur for <i>me</i>, and that is sufficient; if you
      dislike my calling you monseigneur before others, allow me, at least, to
      call you so in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert raised his head as if to read, or try to read, upon Vanel&rsquo;s face
      how much or how little sincerity entered into this protestation of
      devotion. But the counselor knew perfectly well how to sustain the weight
      of such a look, even backed with the full authority of the title he had
      conferred. Colbert sighed; he could not read anything in Vanel&rsquo;s face, and
      Vanel might possibly be honest in his professions, but Colbert recollected
      that this man, inferior to himself in every other respect, was actually
      his master in virtue of the fact of his having a wife. As he was pitying
      this man&rsquo;s lot, Vanel coldly drew from his pocket a perfumed letter,
      sealed with Spanish wax, and held it towards Colbert, saying, &ldquo;A letter
      from my wife, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert coughed, took, opened and read the letter, and then put it
      carefully away in his pocket, while Vanel turned over the leaves of the
      papers he had brought with him with an unmoved and unconcerned air.
      &ldquo;Vanel,&rdquo; he said suddenly to his <i>protege</i>, &ldquo;you are a hard-working
      man, I know; would twelve hours&rsquo; daily labor frighten you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I work fifteen hours every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. A counselor need not work more than three hours a day in
      parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am working up some returns for a friend of mine in the department
      of accounts, and, as I still have spare time on my hands, I am studying
      Hebrew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reputation stands high in the parliament, Vanel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not grow rusty in your post of counselor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must I do to avoid it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purchase a high place. Mean and low ambitions are very difficult to
      satisfy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small purses are the most difficult ones to fill, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What post have you in view?&rdquo; said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see none&mdash;not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one, certainly, but one need be almost the king himself to be
      able to buy it without inconvenience; and the king will not be inclined, I
      suppose, to purchase the post of procureur-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, Vanel fixed his peculiar, humble, dull look upon Colbert,
      who could hardly tell whether Vanel comprehended him or not. &ldquo;Why do you
      speak to me, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Vanel, &ldquo;of the post of procureur-general
      to the parliament; I know no other post than the one M. Fouquet fills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so, my dear counselor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not over fastidious, monseigneur; but before the post can be
      bought, it must be offered for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, Monsieur Vanel, that it will be for sale before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sale! What! M. Fouquet&rsquo;s post of procureur-general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is <i>said</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The post which renders him so perfectly invincible, for sale! Ha, ha!&rdquo;
       said Vanel, beginning to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be afraid, then, of the post?&rdquo; said Colbert, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid! no; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you desirous of obtaining it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are laughing at me, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Vanel. &ldquo;Is it likely that a
      counselor of the parliament would not be desirous of becoming
      procureur-general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur Vanel, since I tell you that the post, as report goes,
      will be shortly for sale&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help repeating, monseigneur, that it is impossible; a man never
      throws away the buckler, behind which he maintains his honor, his fortune,
      his very life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are certain men mad enough, Vanel, to fancy themselves out of the
      reach of all mischances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur; but such men never commit their mad acts for the
      advantage of the poor Vanels of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the very reason that those Vanels are poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that M. Fouquet&rsquo;s post might cost a good round sum. What would
      you bid for it, Monsieur Vanel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything I am worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or four hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the post is worth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million and a half, at the very lowest. I know persons who have offered
      one million seven hundred thousand francs, without being able to persuade
      M. Fouquet to sell. Besides, supposing it were to happen that M. Fouquet
      wished to sell, which I do not believe, in spite of what I have been told&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you have heard something about it, then; who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Gourville, M. Pelisson, and others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; if, therefore, M. Fouquet did wish to sell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not buy it just yet, since the superintendent will only sell for
      ready money, and no one has a million and a half to put down at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert suddenly interrupted the counselor by an imperious gesture; he had
      begun to meditate. Observing his superior&rsquo;s serious attitude, and his
      perseverance in continuing the conversation on this subject, Vanel awaited
      the solution without venturing to precipitate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain to me the privileges which this post confers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right of impeaching every French subject who is not a prince of the
      blood; the right of quashing all proceedings taken against any Frenchman,
      who is neither king nor prince. The procureur-general is the king&rsquo;s right
      hand to punish the guilty; the office is the means whereby also he can
      evade the administration of justice. M. Fouquet, therefore, would be able,
      by stirring up parliament, to maintain himself even against the king; and
      the king could as easily, by humoring M. Fouquet, get his edicts
      registered in spite of every opposition and objection. The
      procureur-general can be made a very useful or a very dangerous
      instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanel, would you like to be procureur-general?&rdquo; said Colbert, suddenly,
      softening both his look and his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed the latter; &ldquo;I have already had the honor to represent to
      you that I want about eleven hundred thousand francs to make up the
      amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Borrow that sum from your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no friends richer than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an honest and honorable man, Vanel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monseigneur, if the world would only think as you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, and that is quite enough; and if it should be needed, I will
      be your security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget the proverb, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he who becomes responsible for another has to pay for his fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that make no difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vanel rose, bewildered by this offer which had been so suddenly and
      unexpectedly made to him. &ldquo;You are not trifling with me, monseigneur?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay; you say that M. Gourville has spoken to you about M. Fouquet&rsquo;s
      post?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and M. Pelisson, also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officially so, or only through their own suggestion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These were their very words: &lsquo;The parliament members are as proud as they
      are wealthy; they ought to club together two or three millions among
      themselves, to present to their protector and leader, M. Fouquet.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that, for my own part, I would give ten thousand francs if
      necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you like M. Fouquet, then!&rdquo; exclaimed Colbert, with a look of hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but M. Fouquet is our chief. He is in debt&mdash;is on the high road
      to ruin; and we ought to save the honor of the body of which we are
      members.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; and that explains why M. Fouquet will be always safe and sound,
      so long as he occupies his present post,&rdquo; replied Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thereupon,&rdquo; said Vanel, &ldquo;M. Gourville added, &lsquo;If we were to do anything
      out of charity to M. Fouquet, it could not be otherwise than most
      humiliating to him; and he would be sure to refuse it. Let the parliament
      subscribe among themselves to purchase, in a proper manner, the post of
      procureur-general; in that case, all would go well; the honor of our body
      would be saved, and M. Fouquet&rsquo;s pride spared.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an opening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I considered it so, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur Vanel, you will go at once, and find out either M.
      Gourville or M. Pelisson. Do you know any other friend of M. Fouquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know M. de la Fontaine very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Fontaine, the rhymester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he used to write verses to my wife, when M. Fouquet was one of our
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him, then, and try and procure an interview with the
      superintendent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly&mdash;but the sum itself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the day and hour you arrange to settle the matter, Monsieur Vanel, you
      shall be supplied with the money, so do not make yourself uneasy on <i>that</i>
      account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, such munificence! You eclipse kings even&mdash;you surpass
      M. Fouquet himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a moment&mdash;do not let us mistake each other: I do not make you a
      present of fourteen hundred thousand francs, Monsieur Vanel; for I have
      children to provide for&mdash;but I will <i>lend</i> you that sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask whatever interest, whatever security you please, monseigneur; I am
      quite ready. And when all your requisitions are satisfied, I will still
      repeat, that you surpass kings and M. Fouquet in munificence. What
      conditions do you impose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The repayment in eight years, and a mortgage upon the appointment
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. I reserve to myself the right of purchasing the post from
      you at one hundred and fifty thousand francs profit for yourself, if, in
      your mode of filling the office, you do not follow out a line of conduct
      in conformity with the interests of the king and with my projects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; said Vanel, in an altered tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything in that which can possibly be objectionable to you,
      Monsieur Vanel?&rdquo; said Colbert, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no,&rdquo; replied Vanel, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. We will sign an agreement to that effect whenever you like.
      And now go as quickly as you can to M. Fouquet&rsquo;s friend, obtain an
      interview with the superintendent; do not be too difficult in making
      whatever concessions may be required of you; and when once the
      arrangements are all made&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will press him to sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be most careful to do nothing of the kind; do not speak of signatures
      with M. Fouquet, nor of deeds, nor even ask him to pass his word.
      Understand this: otherwise you will lose everything. All you have to do is
      to get M. Fouquet to give you his hand on the matter. Go, go.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIII. An Interview with the Queen-Mother.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The queen-mother was in the bedroom at the Palais Royal, with Madame de
      Motteville and Senora Molina. King Louis, who had been impatiently
      expected the whole day, had not made his appearance; and the queen, who
      was growing impatient, had often sent to inquire about him. The moral
      atmosphere of the court seemed to indicate an approaching storm; the
      courtiers and the ladies of the court avoided meeting in the ante-chambers
      and the corridors in order not to converse on compromising subjects.
      Monsieur had joined the king early in the morning for a hunting-party;
      Madame remained in her own apartment, cool and distant to every one; and
      the queen-mother, after she had said her prayers in Latin, talked of
      domestic matters with her two friends in pure Castilian. Madame de
      Motteville, who understood the language perfectly, answered her in French.
      When the three ladies had exhausted every form of dissimulation and of
      politeness, as a circuitous mode of expressing that the king&rsquo;s conduct was
      making the queen and the queen-mother pine away through sheer grief and
      vexation, and when, in the most guarded and polished phrases, they had
      fulminated every variety of imprecation against Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere, the queen-mother terminated her attack by an exclamation
      indicative of her own reflections and character. &ldquo;<i>Estos hijos!</i>&rdquo;
       said she to Molina&mdash;which means, &ldquo;These children!&rdquo; words full of
      meaning on a mother&rsquo;s lips&mdash;words full of terrible significance in
      the mouth of a queen who, like Anne of Austria, hid many curious secrets
      in her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Molina, &ldquo;children, children! for whom every mother becomes a
      sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the queen; &ldquo;a mother sacrifices everything, certainly.&rdquo; She
      did not finish her phrase; for she fancied, when she raised her eyes
      towards the full-length portrait of the pale Louis XIII., that light once
      more flashed from her husband&rsquo;s dull eyes, and his nostrils grew livid
      with wrath. The portrait seemed animated by a living expression&mdash;speak
      it did not, but it seemed to threaten. A profound silence succeeded the
      queen&rsquo;s last remark. La Molina began to turn over ribbons and laces on a
      large work-table. Madame de Motteville, surprised at the look of mutual
      intelligence which had been exchanged between the confidant and her
      mistress, cast down her eyes like a discreet woman, and pretending to be
      observant of nothing that was passing, listened with the utmost attention
      to every word. She heard nothing, however, but a very insignificant &ldquo;hum&rdquo;
       on the part of the Spanish duenna, who was the incarnation of caution&mdash;and
      a profound sigh on that of the queen. She looked up immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are suffering?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Motteville, no; why do you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty almost groaned just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; I did sigh, in truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Valot is not far off; I believe he is in Madame&rsquo;s apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is he with Madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is troubled with nervous attacks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine disorder, indeed! There is little good in M. Valot being
      there, when a very different physician would quickly cure Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Motteville looked up with an air of great surprise, as she
      replied, &ldquo;Another doctor instead of M. Valot?&mdash;whom do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Occupation, Motteville, occupation. If any one is really ill, it is my
      poor daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your majesty, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less so this evening, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not believe that too confidently, madame,&rdquo; said De Motteville. And, as
      if to justify her caution, a sharp, acute pain seized the queen, who
      turned deadly pale, and threw herself back in the chair, with every
      symptom of a sudden fainting fit. Molina ran to a richly gilded
      tortoise-shell cabinet, from which she took a large rock-crystal bottle of
      scented salts, and held it to the queen&rsquo;s nostrils, who inhaled it wildly
      for a few minutes, and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hastening my death&mdash;but Heaven&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty&rsquo;s death is not so near at hand,&rdquo; added Molina, replacing the
      smelling-bottle in the cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your majesty feel better now?&rdquo; inquired Madame de Motteville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; returned the queen, placing her finger on her lips, to
      impose silence on her favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; remarked Madame de Motteville, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is strange?&rdquo; said the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your majesty remember the day when this pain attacked you for the
      first time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember only that it was a grievously sad day for me, Motteville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your majesty did not always regard that day as a sad one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because three and twenty years ago, on that very day, his present
      majesty, your own glorious son, was born at the very same hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen uttered a loud cry, buried her face in her hands, and seemed
      utterly prostrated for some minutes; but whether from recollections which
      arose in her mind, or from reflection, or even with sheer pain, was
      doubtful. La Molina darted a look at Madame de Motteville, so full of
      bitter reproach, that the poor woman, perfectly ignorant of its meaning,
      was in her own exculpation on the point of asking an explanation, when,
      suddenly, Anne of Austria arose and said, &ldquo;Yes, the 5th of September; my
      sorrow began on the 5th of September. The greatest joy, one day; the
      deepest sorrow the next;&mdash;the sorrow,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;the bitter
      expiation of a too excessive joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, from that moment, Anne of Austria, whose memory and reason seemed to
      be suspended for the time, remained impenetrable, with vacant look, mind
      almost wandering, and hands hanging heavily down, as if life had almost
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must put her to bed,&rdquo; said La Molina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, Molina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us leave the queen alone,&rdquo; added the Spanish attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Motteville rose; large tears were rolling down the queen&rsquo;s
      pallid face; and Molina, having observed this sign of weakness, fixed her
      black vigilant eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied the queen. &ldquo;Leave us, Motteville; go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;us&rdquo; produced a disagreeable effect upon the ears of the French
      favorite; for it signified that an interchange of secrets, or of
      revelations of the past, was about to be made, and that one person was <i>de
      trop</i> in the conversation which seemed likely to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Molina, alone, be sufficient for your majesty to-night?&rdquo; inquired
      the French woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the queen. Madame de Motteville bowed in submission, and
      was about to withdraw, when suddenly an old female attendant, dressed as
      if she had belonged to the Spanish court of the year 1620, opened the
      door, and surprised the queen in her tears. &ldquo;The remedy!&rdquo; she cried,
      delightedly, to the queen, as she unceremoniously approached the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What remedy?&rdquo; said Anne of Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your majesty&rsquo;s sufferings,&rdquo; the former replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brings it?&rdquo; asked Madame de Motteville, eagerly; &ldquo;Monsieur Valot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a lady from Flanders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Flanders? Is she Spanish?&rdquo; inquired the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her position in life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will answer that herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is masked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Molina; go and see!&rdquo; cried the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is needless,&rdquo; suddenly replied a voice, at once firm and gentle in its
      tone, which proceeded from the other side of the tapestry hangings; a
      voice which made the attendants start, and the queen tremble excessively.
      At the same moment, a masked female appeared through the hangings, and,
      before the queen could speak a syllable she added, &ldquo;I am connected with
      the order of the Beguines of Bruges, and do, indeed, bring with me the
      remedy which is certain to effect a cure of your majesty&rsquo;s complaint.&rdquo; No
      one uttered a sound, and the Beguine did not move a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, when we are alone,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria looked at her attendants, who immediately withdrew. The
      Beguine, thereupon, advanced a few steps towards the queen, and bowed
      reverently before her. The queen gazed with increasing mistrust at this
      woman, who, in her turn, fixed a pair of brilliant eyes upon her, through
      her mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen of France must, indeed, be very ill,&rdquo; said Anne of Austria, &ldquo;if
      it is known at the Beguinage of Bruges that she stands in need of being
      cured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is not irremediably ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me how you happen to know I am suffering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty has friends in Flanders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since these friends, then, sent you, mention their names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, madame, since your majesty&rsquo;s memory has not been awakened by
      your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria looked up, endeavoring to discover through the mysterious
      mask, and this ambiguous language, the name of her companion, who
      expressed herself with such familiarity and freedom; then, suddenly,
      wearied by a curiosity which wounded every feeling of pride in her nature,
      she said, &ldquo;You are ignorant, perhaps, that royal personages are never
      spoken to with the face masked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deign to excuse me, madame,&rdquo; replied the Beguine, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot excuse you. I may, possibly, forgive you, if you throw your mask
      aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made a vow, madame, to attend and aid all afflicted and suffering
      persons, without ever permitting them to behold my face. I might have been
      able to administer some relief to your body and to your mind, too; but
      since your majesty forbids me, I will take my leave. Adieu, madame,
      adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were uttered with a harmony of tone and respect of manner that
      disarmed the queen of all anger and suspicion, but did not remove her
      feeling of curiosity. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it ill-becomes those who
      are suffering to reject the means of relief Heaven sends them. Speak,
      then; and may you, indeed, be able, as you assert, to administer relief to
      my body&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us first speak a little of the mind, if you please,&rdquo; said the Beguine&mdash;&ldquo;of
      the mind, which, I am sure, must also suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are cancers so insidious in their nature that their very pulsations
      cannot be felt. Such cancers, madame, leave the ivory whiteness of the
      skin unblemished, and putrefy not the firm, fair flesh, with their blue
      tints; the physician who bends over the patient&rsquo;s chest hears not, though
      he listens, the insatiable teeth of the disease grinding onward through
      the muscles, and the blood flows freely on; the knife has never been able
      to destroy, and rarely, even temporarily, to disarm the rage of these
      mortal scourges,&mdash;their home is in the mind, which they corrupt,&mdash;they
      gnaw the whole heart until it breaks. Such, madame, are the cancers fatal
      to queens; are you, too, free from their scourge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne slowly raised her arm, dazzling in its perfect whiteness, and pure in
      its rounded outlines as it was in the time of her earlier days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evils to which you allude,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are the condition of the lives
      of the high in rank upon earth, to whom Heaven has imparted mind. When
      those evils become too heavy to be borne, Heaven lightens their burdens by
      penitence and confession. Thus, only, we lay down our burden and the
      secrets that oppress us. But, forget not that the same gracious Heaven, in
      its mercy, apportions to their trials the strength of the feeble creatures
      of its hand; and my strength has enabled me to bear my burden. For the
      secrets of others, the silence of Heaven is more than sufficient; for my
      own secrets, that of my confessor is enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as courageous, madame, I see, as ever, against your enemies. You
      do not acknowledge your confidence in your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queens have no friends; if you have nothing further to say to me,&mdash;if
      you feel yourself inspired by Heaven as a prophetess&mdash;leave me, I
      pray, for I dread the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have supposed,&rdquo; said the Beguine, resolutely, &ldquo;that you would
      rather have dreaded the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had these words escaped her lips, than the queen rose up proudly.
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; she cried, in a short, imperious tone of voice; &ldquo;explain yourself
      briefly, quickly, entirely; or, if not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, do not threaten me, your majesty,&rdquo; said the Beguine, gently; &ldquo;I came
      here to you full of compassion and respect. I came here on the part of a
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove that to me! Comfort, instead of irritating me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily enough, and your majesty will see who is friendly to you. What
      misfortune has happened to your majesty during these three and twenty
      years past&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious misfortunes, indeed; have I not lost the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak not of misfortunes of <i>that</i> kind. I wish to ask you, if,
      since the birth of the king, any indiscretion on a friend&rsquo;s part has
      caused your majesty the slightest serious anxiety, or distress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; replied the queen, clenching her teeth in order
      to conceal her emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make myself understood, then. Your majesty remembers that the king
      was born on the 5th of September, 1638, at a quarter past eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; stammered out the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At half-past twelve,&rdquo; continued the Beguine, &ldquo;the dauphin, who had been
      baptized by Monseigneur de Meaux in the king&rsquo;s and your own presence, was
      acknowledged as the heir of the crown of France. The king then went to the
      chapel of the old Chateau de Saint-Germain, to hear the <i>Te Deum</i>
      chanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, quite true,&rdquo; murmured the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty&rsquo;s conferment took place in the presence of Monsieur, his
      majesty&rsquo;s late uncle, of the princes, and of the ladies attached to the
      court. The king&rsquo;s physician, Bouvard, and Honore, the surgeon, were
      stationed in the ante-chamber; your majesty slept from three o&rsquo;clock until
      seven, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; but you tell me no more than every one else knows as well as
      you and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am now, madame, approaching that which very few persons are acquainted
      with. Very few persons, did I say, alas! I might say two only, for
      formerly there were but five in all, and, for many years past, the secret
      has been well preserved by the deaths of the principal participators in
      it. The late king sleeps now with his ancestors; Perronnette, the midwife,
      soon followed him; Laporte is already forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen opened her lips as though to reply; she felt, beneath her icy
      hand, with which she kept her face half concealed, the beads of
      perspiration on her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; pursued the Beguine; &ldquo;the king was seated at
      supper, full of joy and happiness; around him on all sides arose wild
      cries of delight and drinking of healths; the people cheered beneath the
      balconies; the Swiss guards, the musketeers, and the royal guards wandered
      through the city, borne about in triumph by the drunken students. Those
      boisterous sounds of general joy disturbed the dauphin, the future king of
      France, who was quietly lying in the arms of Madame de Hausac, his nurse,
      and whose eyes, as he opened them, and stared about, might have observed
      two crowns at the foot of his cradle. Suddenly your majesty uttered a
      piercing cry, and Dame Perronnette immediately flew to your bedside. The
      doctors were dining in a room at some distance from your chamber; the
      palace, deserted from the frequency of the irruptions made into it, was
      without either sentinels or guards. The midwife, having questioned and
      examined your majesty, gave a sudden exclamation as if in wild
      astonishment, and taking you in her arms, bewildered almost out of her
      senses from sheer distress of mind, dispatched Laporte to inform the king
      that her majesty the queen-mother wished to see him in her room. Laporte,
      you are aware, madame, was a man of the most admirable calmness and
      presence of mind. He did not approach the king as if he were the bearer of
      alarming intelligence and wished to inspire the terror he himself
      experienced; besides, it was not a very terrifying intelligence which
      awaited the king. Therefore, Laporte appeared with a smile upon his lips,
      and approached the king&rsquo;s chair, saying to him&mdash;&lsquo;Sire, the queen is
      very happy, and would be still more so to see your majesty.&rsquo; On that day,
      Louis XIII. would have given his crown away to the veriest beggar for a
      &lsquo;God bless you.&rsquo; Animated, light-hearted, and full of gayety, the king
      rose from the table, and said to those around him, in a tone that Henry
      IV. might have adopted,&mdash;&lsquo;Gentlemen, I am going to see my wife.&rsquo; He
      came to your beside, madame, at the very moment Dame Perronnette presented
      to him a second prince, as beautiful and healthy as the former, and said&mdash;&lsquo;Sire,
      Heaven will not allow the kingdom of France to fall into the female line.&rsquo; 
      The king, yielding to a first impulse, clasped the child in his arms, and
      cried, &lsquo;Oh, Heaven, I thank Thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this part of her recital, the Beguine paused, observing how intensely
      the queen was suffering; she had thrown herself back in her chair, and
      with her head bent forward and her eyes fixed, listened without seeming to
      hear, and her lips moving convulsively, either breathing a prayer to
      Heaven or imprecations on the woman standing before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I do not believe that, if, because there could be but one dauphin in
      France,&rdquo; exclaimed the Beguine, &ldquo;the queen allowed that child to vegetate,
      banished from his royal parents&rsquo; presence, she was on that account an
      unfeeling mother. Oh, no, no; there are those alive who have known and
      witnessed the passionate kisses she imprinted on that innocent creature in
      exchange for a life of misery and gloom to which state policy condemned
      the twin brother of Louis XIV.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Heaven!&rdquo; murmured the queen feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is admitted,&rdquo; continued the Beguine, quickly, &ldquo;that when the king
      perceived the effect which would result from the existence of two sons,
      equal in age and pretensions, he trembled for the welfare of France, for
      the tranquillity of the state; and it is equally well known that Cardinal
      de Richelieu, by the direction of Louis XIII., thought over the subject
      with deep attention, and after an hour&rsquo;s meditation in his majesty&rsquo;s
      cabinet, he pronounced the following sentence:&mdash;&lsquo;One prince means
      peace and safety for the state; two competitors, civil war and anarchy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen rose suddenly from her seat, pale as death, and her hands
      clenched together:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know too much,&rdquo; she said, in a hoarse, thick voice, &ldquo;since you refer
      to secrets of state. As for the friends from whom you have acquired this
      secret, they are false and treacherous. You are their accomplice in the
      crime which is being now committed. Now, throw aside your mask, or I will
      have you arrested by my captain of the guards. Do not think that this
      secret terrifies me! You have obtained it, you shall restore it to me.
      Never shall it leave your bosom, for neither your secret nor your own life
      belong to you from this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria, joining gesture to the threat, advanced a couple of steps
      towards the Beguine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Learn,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;to know and value the fidelity, the honor, and
      secrecy of the friends you have abandoned.&rdquo; And, then, suddenly she threw
      aside her mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Chevreuse!&rdquo; exclaimed the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your majesty, the sole living <i>confidante</i> of the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Anne of Austria; &ldquo;come and embrace me, duchesse. Alas! you
      kill your friend in thus trifling with her terrible distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the queen, leaning her head upon the shoulder of the old duchesse,
      burst into a flood of bitter tears. &ldquo;How young you are&mdash;still!&rdquo; said
      the latter, in a hollow voice; &ldquo;you can weep!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIV. Two Friends.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The queen looked steadily at Madame de Chevreuse, and said: &ldquo;I believe you
      just now made use of the word &lsquo;happy&rsquo; in speaking of me. Hitherto,
      duchesse, I had thought it impossible that a human creature could anywhere
      be found more miserable than the queen of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your afflictions, madame, have indeed been terrible enough. But by the
      side of those great and grand misfortunes to which we, two old friends,
      separated by men&rsquo;s malice, were just now alluding, you possess sources of
      pleasure, slight enough in themselves it may be, but greatly envied by the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; said Anne of Austria, bitterly. &ldquo;What can induce you to
      pronounce the word &lsquo;pleasure,&rsquo; duchesse&mdash;you who, just now, admitted
      that my body and my mind both stood in need of remedies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Chevreuse collected herself for a moment, and then murmured,
      &ldquo;How far removed kings are from other people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that they are so far removed from the vulgar herd that they forget
      that others often stand in need of the bare necessities of life. They are
      like the inhabitant of the African mountains, who, gazing from the verdant
      tableland, refreshed by the rills of melted snow, cannot comprehend that
      the dwellers in the plains below are perishing from hunger and thirst in
      the midst of the desert, burnt up by the heat of the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen colored, for she now began to perceive the drift of her friend&rsquo;s
      remark. &ldquo;It was very wrong,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to have neglected you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madame, I know the king has inherited the hatred his father bore me.
      The king would exile me if he knew I were in the Palais Royal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say that the king is very well disposed towards you, duchesse,&rdquo;
       replied the queen; &ldquo;but I could&mdash;secretly, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchesse&rsquo;s disdainful smile produced a feeling of uneasiness in the
      queen&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Duchesse,&rdquo; she hastened to add, &ldquo;you did perfectly right to
      come here, even were it only to give us the happiness of contradicting the
      report of your death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it been rumored, then, that I was dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet my children did not go into mourning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you know, duchesse, the court is very frequently moving about from
      place to place; we see M. Albert de Luynes but seldom, and many things
      escape our minds in the midst of the preoccupations that constantly beset
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty ought not to have believed the report of my death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Alas! we are all mortal; and you may perceive how rapidly I,
      your younger sister, as we used formerly to say, am approaching the tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your majesty believed me dead, you ought, in that case, to have been
      astonished not to have received the news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death not unfrequently takes us by surprise, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! your majesty, those who are burdened with secrets such as we have
      just now discussed must, as a necessity of their nature, satisfy their
      craving desire to divulge them, and they feel they must gratify that
      desire before they die. Among the various preparations for their final
      journey, the task of placing their papers in order is not omitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty will be sure to learn, in a particular manner, the day of my
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because your majesty will receive the next day, under several coverings,
      everything connected with our mysterious correspondence of former times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not burn them?&rdquo; cried Anne, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traitors only,&rdquo; replied the duchesse, &ldquo;destroy a royal correspondence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traitors, do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly, or rather they pretend to destroy, instead of which they
      keep or sell it. Faithful friends, on the contrary, most carefully secrete
      such treasures, for it may happen that some day or other they would wish
      to seek out their queen in order to say to her: &lsquo;Madame, I am getting old;
      my health is fast failing me; in the presence of the danger of death, for
      there is the risk for your majesty that this secret may be revealed, take,
      therefore, this paper, so fraught with menace for yourself, and trust not
      to another to burn it for you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What paper do you refer to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I am concerned, I have but one, it is true, but that is indeed
      most dangerous in its nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! duchesse, tell me what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter, dated Tuesday, the 2d of August, 1644, in which you beg me to
      go to Noisy-le-Sec, to see that unhappy child. In your own handwriting,
      madame, there are those words, &lsquo;that unhappy child!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence ensued; the queen&rsquo;s mind was busy in the past; Madame
      de Chevreuse was watching the progress of her scheme. &ldquo;Yes, unhappy, most
      unhappy!&rdquo; murmured Anne of Austria; &ldquo;how sad the existence he led, poor
      child, to finish it in so cruel a manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; cried the duchesse suddenly, with a curiosity whose genuine
      accents the queen instinctively detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died of consumption, died forgotten, died withered and blighted like
      the flowers a lover has given to his mistress, which she leaves to die
      secreted in a drawer where she had hid them from the gaze of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died!&rdquo; repeated the duchesse with an air of discouragement, which would
      have afforded the queen the most unfeigned delight, had it not been
      tempered in some measure with a mixture of doubt&mdash;&ldquo;Died&mdash;at
      Noisy-le-Sec?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in the arms of his tutor, a poor, honest man, who did not long
      survive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can easily be understood; it is so difficult to bear up under the
      weight of such a loss and such a secret,&rdquo; said Madame de Chevreuse,&mdash;the
      irony of which reflection the queen pretended not to perceive. Madame de
      Chevreuse continued: &ldquo;Well, madame, I inquired some years ago at
      Noisy-le-Sec about this unhappy child. I was told that it was not believed
      he was dead, and that was my reason for not having at first condoled with
      your majesty; for, most certainly, if I could have thought it were true,
      never should I have made the slightest allusion to so deplorable an event,
      and thus have re-awakened your majesty&rsquo;s most natural distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that it is not believed the child died at Noisy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they say about him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said&mdash;but, no doubt, they were mistaken&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, speak, speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said, that one evening, about the year 1645, a lady, beautiful and
      majestic in her bearing, which was observed notwithstanding the mask and
      the mantle that concealed her figure&mdash;a lady of rank, of very high
      rank, no doubt&mdash;came in a carriage to the place where the road
      branches off; the very same spot, you know, where I awaited news of the
      young prince when your majesty was graciously pleased to send me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the boy&rsquo;s tutor, or guardian, took the child to this lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That both the child and his tutor left that part of the country the very
      next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see there is some truth in what you relate, since, in point of
      fact, the poor child died from a sudden attack of illness, which makes the
      lives of all children, as doctors say, suspended as it were by a thread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What your majesty says is quite true; no one knows it better than
      yourself&mdash;no one believes it more strongly than myself. But yet, how
      strange it is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it now be?&rdquo; thought the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person who gave me these details, who was sent to inquire after the
      child&rsquo;s health&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you confide such a charge to any one else? Oh, duchesse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one as dumb as your majesty, as dumb as myself; we will suppose it
      was myself, Madame; this some one, some months after, passing through
      Touraine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touraine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recognized both the tutor and the child, too! I am wrong, thought he
      recognized them, both living, cheerful, happy, and flourishing, the one in
      a green old age, the other in the flower of his youth. Judge after that
      what truth can be attributed to the rumors which are circulated, or what
      faith, after that, placed in anything that may happen in the world! But I
      am fatiguing your majesty; it was not my intention, however, to do so, and
      I will take my leave of you, after renewing to you the assurance of my
      most respectful devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, duchesse; let us first talk a little about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of myself, madame! I am not worthy that you should bend your looks upon
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, indeed? Are you not the oldest friend I have? Are you angry with
      me, duchesse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, indeed! what motive could I have? If I had reason to be angry with
      your majesty, should I have come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duchesse, age is fast creeping on us both; we should be united against
      that death whose approach cannot be far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overpower me, madame, with the kindness of your language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has ever loved or served me as you have done, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is too kind in remembering it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so. Give me a proof of your friendship, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My whole being is devoted to you, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proof I require is, that you should ask something of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you well,&mdash;no one is more disinterested, more noble, and
      truly loyal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not praise me too highly, madame,&rdquo; said the duchesse, somewhat
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could never praise you as much as you deserve to be praised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, age and misfortune effect a terrible change in people, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better; for the beautiful, the haughty, the adored duchesse
      of former days might have answered me ungratefully, &lsquo;I do not wish for
      anything from you.&rsquo; Heaven be praised! The misfortunes you speak of have
      indeed worked a change in you, for you will now, perhaps, answer me, &lsquo;I
      accept.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchesse&rsquo;s look and smile soon changed at this conclusion, and she no
      longer attempted to act a false part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, dearest, what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must first explain to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so unhesitatingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, your majesty can confer the greatest, the most ineffable
      pleasure upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the queen, a little distant in her manner, from an
      uneasiness of feeling produced by this remark. &ldquo;But do not forget, my good
      Chevreuse, that I am quite as much under my son&rsquo;s influence as I was
      formerly under my husband&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not be too hard, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me as you used to do; it will be a sweet echo of our happy youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my dear mistress, my darling Anne&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Spanish, still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me in Spanish, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your majesty do me the honor to pass a few days with me at
      Dampierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said the queen, stupefied. &ldquo;Nothing more than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! can you possibly imagine that, in asking you that, I am not
      asking you the greatest conceivable favor? If that really be the case, you
      do not know me. Will you accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, gladly. And I shall be happy,&rdquo; continued the queen, with some
      suspicion, &ldquo;if my presence can in any way be useful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Useful!&rdquo; exclaimed the duchesse, laughing; &ldquo;oh, no, no, agreeable&mdash;delightful,
      if you like; and you promise me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; said the queen, whereupon the duchesse seized her beautiful
      hand, and covered it with kisses. The queen could not help murmuring to
      herself, &ldquo;She is a good-hearted woman, and very generous, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your majesty consent to wait a fortnight before you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; but why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the duchesse, &ldquo;knowing me to be in disgrace, no one would
      lend me the hundred thousand francs, which I require to put Dampierre into
      a state of repair. But when it is known that I require that sum for the
      purpose of receiving your majesty at Dampierre properly, all the money in
      Paris will be at my disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the queen, gently nodding her head in sign of intelligence, &ldquo;a
      hundred thousand francs! you want a hundred thousand francs to put
      Dampierre into repair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite as much as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one will lend you them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lend them to you, if you like, duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hardly dare accept such a sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be wrong if you did <i>not</i>. Besides, a hundred thousand
      francs is really not much. I know but too well that you never set a right
      value upon your silence and secrecy. Push that table a little towards me,
      duchesse, and I will write you an order on M. Colbert; no, on M. Fouquet,
      who is a far more courteous and obliging man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he pay it, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he will not pay it, I will; but it will be the first time he will have
      refused me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen wrote and handed the duchesse the order, and afterwards
      dismissed her with a warm embrace.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLV. How Jean de La Fontaine Came to Write His First Tale.
    </h2>
    <p>
      All these intrigues are exhausted; the human mind, so variously
      complicated, has been enabled to develop itself at its ease in the three
      outlines with which our recital has supplied it. It is not unlikely that,
      in the future we are now preparing, a question of politics and intrigues
      may still arise, but the springs by which they work will be so carefully
      concealed that no one will be able to see aught but flowers and paintings,
      just as at a theater, where a colossus appears upon the scene, walking
      along moved by the small legs and slender arms of a child concealed within
      the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now return to Saint-Mande, where the superintendent was in the habit of
      receiving his select confederacy of epicureans. For some time past the
      host had met with nothing but trouble. Every one in the house was aware of
      and felt for the minister&rsquo;s distress. No more magnificent or recklessly
      improvident <i>reunions</i>. Money had been the pretext assigned by
      Fouquet, and never <i>was</i> any pretext, as Gourville said, more
      fallacious, for there was not even a shadow of money to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Vatel was resolutely painstaking in keeping up the reputation of the
      house, and yet the gardeners who supplied the kitchens complained of
      ruinous delays. The agents for the supply of Spanish wines sent drafts
      which no one honored; fishermen, whom the superintendent engaged on the
      coast of Normandy, calculated that if they were paid all that was due to
      them, the amount would enable them to retire comfortably for life; fish,
      which, at a later period, was the cause of Vatel&rsquo;s death, did not arrive
      at all. However, on the ordinary reception days, Fouquet&rsquo;s friends flocked
      in more numerously than ever. Gourville and the Abbe Fouquet talked over
      money matters&mdash;that is to say, the abbe borrowed a few pistoles from
      Gourville; Pelisson, seated with his legs crossed, was engaged in
      finishing the peroration of a speech with which Fouquet was to open the
      parliament; and this speech was a masterpiece, because Pelisson wrote it
      for his friend&mdash;that is to say, he inserted all kinds of clever
      things the latter would most certainly never have taken the trouble to say
      of his own accord. Presently Loret and La Fontaine would enter from the
      garden, engaged in a dispute about the art of making verses. The painters
      and musicians, in their turn, were hovering near the dining-room. As soon
      as eight o&rsquo;clock struck the supper would be announced, for the
      superintendent never kept any one waiting. It was already half-past seven,
      and the appetites of the guests were beginning to declare themselves in an
      emphatic manner. As soon as all the guests were assembled, Gourville went
      straight up to Pelisson, awoke him out of his reverie, and led him into
      the middle of a room, and closed the doors. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;anything
      new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pelisson raised his intelligent and gentle face, and said: &ldquo;I have
      borrowed five and twenty thousand francs of my aunt, and I have them here
      in good sterling money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replied Gourville; &ldquo;we only what one hundred and ninety-five
      thousand livres for the first payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The payment of what?&rdquo; asked La Fontaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! absent-minded as usual! Why, it was you who told us the small
      estate at Corbeli was going to be sold by one of M. Fouquet&rsquo;s creditors;
      and you, also, who proposed that all his friends should subscribe&mdash;more
      than that, it was you who said that you would sell a corner of your house
      at Chateau-Thierry, in order to furnish your own proportion, and you come
      and ask&mdash;&lsquo;<i>The payment of what?</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark was received with a general laugh, which made La Fontaine
      blush. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had not forgotten it; oh, no! only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only you remembered nothing about it,&rdquo; replied Loret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the truth, and the fact is, he is quite right, there is a great
      difference between forgetting and not remembering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; added Pelisson, &ldquo;you bring your mite in the shape of the
      price of the piece of land you have sold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold? no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not sold the field, then?&rdquo; inquired Gourville, in astonishment,
      for he knew the poet&rsquo;s disinterestedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife would not let me,&rdquo; replied the latter, at which there were fresh
      bursts of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you went to Chateau-Thierry for that purpose,&rdquo; said some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I did, and on horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had eight different horses, and I was almost bumped to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an excellent fellow! And you rested yourself when you arrived
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rested! Oh! of course I did, for I had an immense deal of work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife had been flirting with the man to whom I wished to sell the land.
      The fellow drew back from his bargain, and so I challenged him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, and you fought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing about it, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my wife and her relations interfered in the matter. I was kept a
      quarter of an hour with my sword in my hand; but I was not wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your adversary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he wasn&rsquo;t wounded either, for he never came on the field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; cried his friends from all sides, &ldquo;you must have been terribly
      angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exceedingly so; I caught cold; I returned home and then my wife began to
      quarrel with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In real earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in real earnest. She threw a loaf of bread at my head, a large
      loaf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I upset the table over her and her guests; and then I got on my horse
      again, and here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one had great difficulty in keeping his countenance at the exposure
      of this heroi-comedy, and when the laughter had subsided, one of the
      guests present said to La Fontaine: &ldquo;Is that all you have brought back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I have an excellent idea in my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed that there is a good deal of sportive, jesting poetry
      written in France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; replied every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; pursued La Fontaine, &ldquo;only a very small portion of it is printed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The laws are strict, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be; but a rare article is a dear article, and that is the reason
      why I have written a small poem, excessively free in its style, very
      broad, and extremely cynical in its tone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the poet, with assumed indifference, &ldquo;and I have
      introduced the greatest freedom of language I could possibly employ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peals of laughter again broke forth, while the poet was thus announcing
      the quality of his wares. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have tried to excel
      everything that Boccaccio, Aretin, and other masters of their craft have
      written in the same style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its fate is clear,&rdquo; said Pelisson; &ldquo;it will be suppressed and forbidden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said La Fontaine, simply. &ldquo;I assure you I did not do it
      on my own account so much as M. Fouquet&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This wonderful conclusion again raised the mirth of all present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have sold the first edition of this little book for eight hundred
      livres,&rdquo; exclaimed La Fontaine, rubbing his hands together. &ldquo;Serious and
      religions books sell at about half that rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been better,&rdquo; said Gourville, &ldquo;to have written two
      religious books instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been too long, and not amusing enough,&rdquo; replied La Fontaine
      tranquilly; &ldquo;my eight hundred livres are in this little bag, and I beg to
      offer them as <i>my</i> contribution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he placed his offering in the hands of their treasurer;
      it was then Loret&rsquo;s turn, who gave a hundred and fifty livres; the others
      stripped themselves in the same way; and the total sum in the purse
      amounted to forty thousand livres. The money was still being counted over
      when the superintendent noiselessly entered the room; he had heard
      everything; and then this man, who had possessed so many millions, who had
      exhausted all the pleasures and honors the world had to bestow, this
      generous heart, this inexhaustible brain, which had, like two burning
      crucibles, devoured the material and moral substance of the first kingdom
      in Europe, was seen to cross the threshold with tears in his eyes, and
      pass his fingers through the gold and silver which the bag contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor offering,&rdquo; he said, in a softened and affected tone of voice, &ldquo;you
      will disappear into the smallest corner of my empty purse, but you have
      filled to overflowing that which no one can ever exhaust, my heart. Thank
      you, my friends&mdash;thank you.&rdquo; And as he could not embrace every one
      present, who were all tearful, too, philosophers as they were, he embraced
      La Fontaine, saying to him, &ldquo;Poor fellow! so you have, on my account, been
      beaten by your wife and censured by your confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is a mere nothing,&rdquo; replied the poet; &ldquo;if your creditors will only
      wait a couple of years, I shall have written a hundred other tales, which,
      at two editions each, will pay off the debt.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVI. La Fontaine in the Character of a Negotiator.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fouquet pressed La Fontaine&rsquo;s hand most warmly, saying to him, &ldquo;My dear
      poet, write a hundred other tales, not only for the eighty pistoles which
      each of them will produce you, but, still more, to enrich our language
      with a hundred new masterpieces of composition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said La Fontaine, with a little air of pride, &ldquo;you must not suppose
      that I have only brought this idea and the eighty pistoles to the
      superintendent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! indeed,&rdquo; was the general acclamation from all parts of the room, &ldquo;M.
      de la Fontaine is in funds to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; replied La Fontaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, quick!&rdquo; cried the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said Pelisson in La Fontaine&rsquo;s ear; &ldquo;you have had a most
      brilliant success up to the present moment; do not go beyond your depth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Monsieur Pelisson; and you, who are a man of decided taste,
      will be the first to approve of what I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are talking of millions, remember,&rdquo; said Gourville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fifteen hundred thousand francs here, Monsieur Gourville,&rdquo; he
      replied, striking himself on the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce take this Gascon from Chateau-Thierry!&rdquo; cried Loret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the pocket you must tap&mdash;but the brain,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a moment, monsieur le surintendant,&rdquo; added La Fontaine; &ldquo;you are not
      procureur-general&mdash;you are a poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true!&rdquo; cried Loret, Conrart, and every person present connected
      with literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, I repeat, a poet and a painter, a sculptor, a friend of the arts
      and sciences; but, acknowledge that you are no lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I do acknowledge it,&rdquo; replied M. Fouquet, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to be nominated at the Academy, you would refuse, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should, with all due deference to the academicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; if, therefore, you do not wish to belong to the Academy, why
      do you allow yourself to form one of the parliament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Pelisson, &ldquo;we are talking politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to know whether the barrister&rsquo;s gown does or does not become M.
      Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question of the gown at all,&rdquo; retorted Pelisson, annoyed at
      the laughter of those who were present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, it is the gown,&rdquo; said Loret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the gown away from the procureur-general,&rdquo; said Conrart, &ldquo;and we
      have M. Fouquet left us still, of whom we have no reason to complain; but,
      as he is no procureur-general without his gown, we agree with M. de la
      Fontaine and pronounce the gown to be nothing but a bugbear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fugiunt risus leporesque</i>,&rdquo; said Loret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The smiles and the graces,&rdquo; said some one present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the way,&rdquo; said Pelisson, gravely, &ldquo;that I translate <i>lepores</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you translate it?&rdquo; said La Fontaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus: The hares run away as soon as they see M. Fouquet.&rdquo; A burst of
      laughter, in which the superintendent joined, followed this sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why hares?&rdquo; objected Conrart, vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the hare will be the very one who will not be over pleased to see
      M. Fouquet surrounded by all the attributes which his parliamentary
      strength and power confer on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; murmured the poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Quo non ascendam</i>,&rdquo; said Conrart, &ldquo;seems impossible to me, when one
      is fortunate enough to wear the gown of the procureur-general.&rdquo; <a
      href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small>9</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, it seems so to me without that gown,&rdquo; said the obstinate
      Pelisson; &ldquo;what is your opinion, Gourville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the gown in question is a very good thing,&rdquo; replied the latter;
      &ldquo;but I equally think that a million and a half is far better than the
      gown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am of Gourville&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; exclaimed Fouquet, stopping the
      discussion by the expression of his own opinion, which would necessarily
      bear down all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million and a half,&rdquo; Pelisson grumbled out; &ldquo;now I happen to know an
      Indian fable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it to me,&rdquo; said La Fontaine; &ldquo;I ought to know it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it, tell it,&rdquo; said the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a tortoise, which was, as usual, well protected by its shell,&rdquo;
       said Pelisson; &ldquo;whenever its enemies threatened it, it took refuge within
      its covering. One day some one said to it, &lsquo;You must feel very hot in such
      a house as that in the summer, and you are altogether prevented showing
      off your graces; there is a snake here, who will give you a million and a
      half for your shell.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the superintendent, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what next?&rdquo; said La Fontaine, more interested in the apologue than
      in the moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tortoise sold his shell and remained naked and defenseless. A vulture
      happened to see him, and being hungry, broke the tortoise&rsquo;s back with a
      blow of his beak and devoured it. The moral is, that M. Fouquet should
      take very good care to keep his gown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Fontaine understood the moral seriously. &ldquo;You forget Aeschylus,&rdquo; he
      said, to his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aeschylus was bald-headed, and a vulture&mdash;your vulture, probably&mdash;who
      was a great amateur in tortoises, mistook at a distance his head for a
      block of stone, and let a tortoise, which was shrunk up in his shell, fall
      upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, La Fontaine is right,&rdquo; resumed Fouquet, who had become very
      thoughtful; &ldquo;whenever a vulture wishes to devour a tortoise, he well knows
      how to break his shell; but happy is that tortoise a snake pays a million
      and a half for his envelope. If any one were to bring me a
      generous-hearted snake like the one in your fable, Pelisson, I would give
      him my shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Rara avis in terres!</i>&rdquo; cried Conrart. <a href="#linknote-10"
       name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And like a black swan, is he not?&rdquo; added La Fontaine; &ldquo;well, then, the
      bird in question, black and rare, is already found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you have found a purchaser for my post of
      procureur-general?&rdquo; exclaimed Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the superintendent never said that he wished to sell,&rdquo; resumed
      Pelisson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Conrart, &ldquo;you yourself spoke about it, even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am a witness to that,&rdquo; said Gourville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems very tenacious about his brilliant idea,&rdquo; said Fouquet,
      laughing. &ldquo;Well, La Fontaine, who is the purchaser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perfect blackbird, for he is a counselor belonging to the parliament,
      an excellent fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanel!&rdquo; exclaimed Fouquet. &ldquo;Vanel the husband of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, her husband; yes, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Fouquet, with an expression of great interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wishes to be everything that you have been, monsieur,&rdquo; said Gourville,
      &ldquo;and to do everything that you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very agreeable; tell us all about it, La Fontaine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very simple. I see him occasionally, and a short time ago I met
      him, walking about on the Place de la Bastile, at the very moment when I
      was about to take the small carriage to come down here to Saint-Mande.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been watching his wife,&rdquo; interrupted Loret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said La Fontaine, &ldquo;he is far from being jealous. He accosted me,
      embraced me, and took me to the inn called L&rsquo;Image Saint-Fiacre, and told
      me all about his troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has his troubles, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; his wife wants to make him ambitious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and he told you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That some one had spoken to him about a post in parliament; that M.
      Fouquet&rsquo;s name had been mentioned; that ever since, Madame Vanel dreams of
      nothing else than being called madame la procureur-generale, and that it
      makes her ill and kills her every night she does not dream about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor woman!&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. Conrart is always telling me that I do not know how to
      conduct matters of business; you will see how I managed this one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose you know,&rsquo; said I to Vanel, &lsquo;that the value of a post such as
      that which M. Fouquet holds is by no means trifling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How much do you imagine it to be?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;M. Fouquet, I know, has refused seventeen hundred thousand francs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My wife,&rsquo; replied Vanel, &lsquo;had estimated it at about fourteen hundred
      thousand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ready money?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; she has sold some property of hers in Guienne, and has received the
      purchase money.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty sum to touch all at once,&rdquo; said the Abbe Fouquet, who had
      not hitherto said a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Madame Vanel!&rdquo; murmured Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pelisson shrugged his shoulders, as he whispered in Fouquet&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;That
      woman is a perfect fiend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be; and it will be delightful to make use of this fiend&rsquo;s money
      to repair the injury which an angel has done herself for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pelisson looked with a surprised air at Fouquet, whose thoughts were from
      that moment fixed upon a fresh object in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; inquired La Fontaine, &ldquo;what about my negotiation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable, my dear poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gourville; &ldquo;but there are some people who are anxious to have
      the steed who have not even money enough to pay for the bridle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Vanel would draw back from his offer if he were to be taken at his
      word,&rdquo; continued the Abbe Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; said La Fontaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you have not yet heard the <i>denouement</i> of my story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is a <i>denouement</i>, why do you beat about the bush so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Semper ad eventum</i>. Is that correct?&rdquo; said Fouquet, with the air of
      a nobleman who condescends to barbarisms. To which the Latinists present
      answered with loud applause. <a href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11"
       id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My <i>denouement</i>,&rdquo; cried La Fontaine, &ldquo;is that Vanel, that determined
      blackbird, knowing that I was coming to Saint-Mande, implored me to bring
      him with me, and, if possible, to present him to M. Fouquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that he is here; I left him in that part of the ground called Bel-Air.
      Well, M. Fouquet, what is your reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is not respectful towards Madame Vanel that her husband should
      run the risk of catching cold outside my house; send for him, La Fontaine,
      since you know where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will accompany you,&rdquo; said the Abbe Fouquet; &ldquo;I will carry the money
      bags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No jesting,&rdquo; said Fouquet, seriously; &ldquo;let the business be a serious one,
      if it is to be one at all. But first of all, let us show we are
      hospitable. Make my apologies, La Fontaine, to M. Vanel, and tell him how
      distressed I am to have kept him waiting, but that I was not aware he was
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Fontaine set off at once, fortunately accompanied by Gourville, for,
      absorbed in his own calculations, the poet would have mistaken the route,
      and was hurrying as fast as he could towards the village of Saint-Mande.
      Within a quarter of an hour afterwards, M. Vanel was introduced into the
      superintendent&rsquo;s cabinet, a description of which has already been given at
      the beginning of this story. When Fouquet saw him enter, he called to
      Pelisson, and whispered a few words in his ear. &ldquo;Do not lose a single word
      of what I am going to say: let all the silver and gold plate, together
      with my jewels of every description, be packed up in the carriage. You
      will take the black horses: the jeweler will accompany you; and you will
      postpone the supper until Madame de Belliere&rsquo;s arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it be necessary to inform Madame de Belliere of it?&rdquo; said Pelisson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that will be useless; I will do that. So, away with you, my dear
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pelisson set off, not quite clear as to his friend&rsquo;s meaning or intention,
      but confident, like every true friend, in the judgment of the man he was
      blindly obeying. It is that which constitutes the strength of such men;
      distrust only arises in the minds of inferior natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanel bowed lowly to the superintendent, and was about to begin a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble yourself, monsieur,&rdquo; said Fouquet, politely; &ldquo;I am told
      you wish to purchase a post I hold. How much can you give me for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for you, monseigneur, to fix the amount you require. I know that
      offers of purchase have already been made to you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Vanel, I have been told, values it at fourteen hundred thousand
      livres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give me the money immediately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the money with me,&rdquo; said Vanel, frightened almost by the
      unpretending simplicity, amounting to greatness, of the man, for he had
      expected disputes, difficulties, opposition of every kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you be able to bring it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you please, monseigneur;&rdquo; for he began to be afraid that Fouquet
      was trifling with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were not for the trouble you would have in returning to Paris, I
      would say at once; but we will arrange that the payment and the signature
      shall take place at six o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Vanel, as cold as ice, and feeling quite bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, Monsieur Vanel, present my humblest respects to Madame Vanel,&rdquo;
       said Fouquet, as he rose; upon which Vanel, who felt the blood rushing to
      his head, for he was quite confounded by his success, said seriously to
      the superintendent, &ldquo;Will you give me your word, monseigneur, upon this
      affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet turned round his head, saying, &ldquo;<i>Pardieu</i>, and you,
      monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vanel hesitated, trembled all over, and at last finished by hesitatingly
      holding out his hand. Fouquet opened and nobly extended his own; this
      loyal hand lay for a moment in Vanel&rsquo;s most hypocritical palm, and he
      pressed it in his own, in order the better to convince himself of the
      compact. The superintendent gently disengaged his hand, as he again said,
      &ldquo;Adieu.&rdquo; And then Vanel ran hastily to the door, hurried along the
      vestibule, and fled as quickly as he could.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVII. Madame de Belliere&rsquo;s Plate and Diamonds.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fouquet had no sooner dismissed Vanel than he began to reflect for a few
      moments&mdash;&ldquo;A man never can do too much for the woman he has once
      loved. Marguerite wishes to be the wife of a procureur-general&mdash;and
      why not confer this pleasure upon her? And, now that the most scrupulous
      and sensitive conscience will be unable to reproach me with anything, let
      my thoughts be bestowed on her who has shown so much devotion for me.
      Madame de Belliere ought to be there by this time,&rdquo; he said, as he turned
      towards the secret door.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had locked himself in, he opened the subterranean passage, and
      rapidly hastened towards the means of communicating between the house at
      Vincennes and his own residence. He had neglected to apprise his friend of
      his approach, by ringing the bell, perfectly assured that she would never
      fail to be exact at the rendezvous; as, indeed, was the case, for she was
      already waiting. The noise the superintendent made aroused her; she ran to
      take from under the door the letter he had thrust there, and which simply
      said, &ldquo;Come, marquise; we are waiting supper for you.&rdquo; With her heart
      filled with happiness Madame de Belliere ran to her carriage in the Avenue
      de Vincennes, and in a few minutes she was holding out her hand to
      Gourville, who was standing at the entrance, where, in order the better to
      please his master, he had stationed himself to watch her arrival. She had
      not observed that Fouquet&rsquo;s black horse arrived at the same time, all
      steaming and foam-flaked, having returned to Saint-Mande with Pelisson and
      the very jeweler to whom Madame de Belliere had sold her plate and her
      jewels. Pelisson introduced the goldsmith into the cabinet, which Fouquet
      had not yet left. The superintendent thanked him for having been good
      enough to regard as a simple deposit in his hands, the valuable property
      which he had every right to sell; and he cast his eyes on the total of the
      account, which amounted to thirteen hundred thousand francs. Then, going
      for a few moments to his desk, he wrote an order for fourteen hundred
      thousand francs, payable at sight, at his treasury, before twelve o&rsquo;clock
      the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand francs profit!&rdquo; cried the goldsmith. &ldquo;Oh, monseigneur,
      what generosity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, not so, monsieur,&rdquo; said Fouquet, touching him on the shoulder;
      &ldquo;there are certain kindnesses which can never be repaid. This profit is
      only what you have earned; but the interest of your money still remains to
      be arranged.&rdquo; And, saying this, he unfastened from his sleeve a diamond
      button, which the goldsmith himself had often valued at three thousand
      pistoles. &ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; he said to the goldsmith, &ldquo;in remembrance of me.
      Farewell; you are an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, monseigneur,&rdquo; cried the goldsmith, completely overcome, &ldquo;are the
      noblest man that ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet let the worthy goldsmith pass out of the room by a secret door,
      and then went to receive Madame de Belliere, who was already surrounded by
      all the guests. The marquise was always beautiful, but now her loveliness
      was more dazzling than ever. &ldquo;Do you not think, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Fouquet,
      &ldquo;that madame is more than usually beautiful this evening? And do you
      happen to know why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because madame is really the most beautiful of all women,&rdquo; said some one
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but because she is the best. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet?&rdquo; said the marquise, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, all the jewels which madame is wearing this evening are nothing
      but false stones.&rdquo; At this remark the marquise blushed most painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; exclaimed all the guests, &ldquo;that can very well be said of one who
      has the finest diamonds in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Fouquet to Pelisson, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at last I have understood you,&rdquo; returned the latter; &ldquo;and you have
      done exceedingly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper is ready, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Vatel, with majestic air and tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of guests hurried, more quickly than is usually the case with
      ministerial entertainments, towards the banqueting-room, where a
      magnificent spectacle presented itself. Upon the buffets, upon the
      side-tables, upon the supper-table itself, in the midst of flowers and
      light, glittered most dazzlingly the richest and most costly gold and
      silver plate that could possibly be seen&mdash;relics of those ancient
      magnificent productions the Florentine artists, whom the Medici family
      patronized, sculptured, chased, and moulded for the purpose of holding
      flowers, at a time when gold existed still in France. These hidden
      marvels, which had been buried during the civil wars, timidly reappeared
      during the intervals of that war of good taste called La Fronde; at a time
      when noblemen fighting against nobleman killed, but did not pillage each
      other. All the plate present had Madame de Belliere&rsquo;s arms engraved upon
      it. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; cried La Fontaine, &ldquo;here is a P and a B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the most remarkable object present was the cover which Fouquet had
      assigned to the marquise. Near her was a pyramid of diamonds, sapphires,
      emeralds, antique cameos, sardonyx stones, carved by the old Greeks of
      Asia Minor, with mountings of Mysian gold; curious mosaics of ancient
      Alexandria, set in silver; massive Egyptian bracelets lay heaped on a
      large plate of Palissy ware, supported by a tripod of gilt bronze,
      sculptured by Benvenuto Cellini. The marquise turned pale, as she
      recognized what she had never expected to see again. A profound silence
      fell on every one of the restless and excited guests. Fouquet did not even
      make a sign in dismissal of the richly liveried servants who crowded like
      bees round the huge buffets and other tables in the room. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;all this plate which you behold once belonged to Madame de
      Belliere, who, having observed one of her friends in great distress, sent
      all this gold and silver, together with the heap of jewels now before her,
      to her goldsmith. This noble conduct of a devoted friend can well be
      understood by such friends as you. Happy indeed is that man who sees
      himself loved in such a manner. Let us drink to the health of Madame de
      Belliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous burst of applause followed his words, and made poor Madame de
      Belliere sink back dumb and breathless in her seat. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; added
      Pelisson, who was always affected by a noble action, as he was invariably
      impressed by beauty, &ldquo;let us also drink to the health of him who inspired
      madame&rsquo;s noble conduct; for such a man is worthy of being worthily loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now the marquise&rsquo;s turn. She rose, pale and smiling; and as she
      held out her glass with a faltering hand, and her trembling fingers
      touched those of Fouquet, her look, full of love, found its mirror in that
      of her ardent and generous-hearted lover. Begun in this manner, the supper
      soon became a <i>fete</i>; no one tried to be witty, but no one failed in
      being so. La Fontaine forgot his Gorgny wine, and allowed Vatel to
      reconcile him to the wines of the Rhone, and those from the shores of
      Spain. The Abbe Fouquet became so kind and good-natured, that Gourville
      said to him, &ldquo;Take care, monsieur l&rsquo;abbe; if you are so tender, you will
      be carved and eaten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed away so joyously, that, contrary to his usual custom, the
      superintendent did not leave the table before the end of the dessert. He
      smiled upon his friends, delighted as a man is whose heart becomes
      intoxicated before his head&mdash;and, for the first time, looked at the
      clock. Suddenly a carriage rolled into the courtyard, and, strange to say,
      it was heard high above the noise of the mirth which prevailed. Fouquet
      listened attentively, and then turned his eyes towards the ante-chamber.
      It seemed as if he could hear a step passing across it, a step that,
      instead of pressing the ground, weighed heavily upon his heart. &ldquo;M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay, bishop of Vannes,&rdquo; the usher announced. And Aramis&rsquo;s grave and
      thoughtful face appeared upon the threshold of the door, between the
      remains of two garlands, of which the flame of a lamp had just burnt the
      thread that once united them.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVIII. M. de Mazarin&rsquo;s Receipt.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fouquet would have uttered an exclamation of delight on seeing another
      friend arrive, if the cold air and averted aspect of Aramis had not
      restored all his reserve. &ldquo;Are you going to join us at dessert?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;And yet you would be frightened, perhaps, at the noise which our wild
      friends here are making?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Aramis, respectfully, &ldquo;I will begin by begging you
      to excuse me for having interrupted this merry meeting; and then, I will
      beg you to give me, as soon as your pleasure is attended to, a moment&rsquo;s
      audience on matters of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; had aroused the attention of some of the epicureans
      present, Fouquet rose, saying: &ldquo;Business first of all, Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay;
      we are too happy when matters of business arrive only at the end of a
      meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he took the hand of Madame de Belliere, who looked at him
      with a kind of uneasiness, and then led her to an adjoining <i>salon</i>,
      after having recommended her to the most reasonable of his guests. And
      then, taking Aramis by the arm, he led him towards his cabinet. As soon as
      Aramis was there, throwing aside the respectful air he had assumed, he
      threw himself into a chair, saying: &ldquo;Guess whom I have seen this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear chevalier, every time you begin in that manner, I am sure to hear
      you announce something disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and this time you will not be mistaken, either, my dear friend,&rdquo;
       replied Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not keep me in suspense,&rdquo; added Fouquet, phlegmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I have seen Madame de Chevreuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old duchesse, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ghost, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; the old she-wolf herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without teeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, but not without claws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what harm can she meditate against me? I am no miser with women who
      are not prudes. A quality always prized, even by the woman who no longer
      presumes to look for love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Chevreuse knows very well that you are not avaricious, since
      she wishes to draw some money of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! under what pretext?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! pretexts are never wanting with <i>her</i>. Let me tell you what it
      is: it seems that the duchesse has a good many letters of M. de Mazarin&rsquo;s
      in her possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised at that, for the prelate was gallant enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but these letters have nothing whatever to do with the prelate&rsquo;s
      love affairs. They concern, it is said, financial matters rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And accordingly they are less interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not suspect what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never heard speak of a prosecution being instituted for an
      embezzlement, or appropriation rather, of public funds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a hundred, nay, a thousand times. Ever since I have been engaged in
      public matters I have hardly heard of anything else. It is precisely your
      own case, when, as a bishop, people reproach you for impiety; or, as a
      musketeer, for your cowardice; the very thing of which they are always
      accusing ministers of finance is the embezzlement of public funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; but take a particular instance, for the duchesse asserts that
      M. de Mazarin alludes to certain particular instances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like a sum of thirteen millions of francs, of which it would be
      very difficult for you to define the precise nature of the employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirteen millions!&rdquo; said the superintendent, stretching himself in his
      armchair, in order to enable him the more comfortably to look up towards
      the ceiling. &ldquo;Thirteen millions&mdash;I am trying to remember out of all
      those I have been accused of having stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not laugh, my dear monsieur, for it is very serious. It is positive
      that the duchesse has certain letters in her possession, and that these
      letters must be as she represents them, since she wished to sell them to
      me for five hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! one can have a very tolerable calumny got up for such a sum as that,&rdquo;
       replied Fouquet. &ldquo;Ah! now I know what you mean,&rdquo; and he began to laugh
      very heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Aramis, a little reassured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember the story of those thirteen millions now. Yes, yes, I remember
      them quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it; tell me about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, one day Signor Mazarin, Heaven rest his soul! made a profit
      of thirteen millions upon a concession of lands in the Valtelline; he
      canceled them in the registry of receipts, sent them to me, and then made
      me advance them to him for war expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then there is no doubt of their proper destination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the cardinal made me invest them in my own name, and gave me a
      receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the receipt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Fouquet, as he quietly rose from his chair, and went to
      his large ebony bureau inlaid with mother-of-pearl and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I most admire in you,&rdquo; said Aramis, with an air of great
      satisfaction, &ldquo;is, your memory in the first place, then your
      self-possession, and, finally, the perfect order which prevails in your
      administration; you, of all men, too, who are by nature a poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;I am orderly out of a spirit of idleness, to save
      myself the trouble of looking after things, and so I know that Mazarin&rsquo;s
      receipt is in the third drawer under the letter M; I open the drawer, and
      place my hand upon the very paper I need. In the night, without a light, I
      could find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a confident hand he felt the bundle of papers which were piled up
      in the open drawer. &ldquo;Nay, more than that,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I remember the
      paper as if I saw it; it is thick, somewhat crumpled, with gilt edges;
      Mazarin had made a blot upon the figure of the date. Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
      paper knows we are talking about it, and that we want it very much, and so
      it hides itself out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as the superintendent looked into the drawer, Aramis rose from his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very singular,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your memory is treacherous, my dear monseigneur; look in another drawer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet took out the bundle of papers, and turned them over once more; he
      then grew very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t confine your search to that drawer,&rdquo; said Aramis; &ldquo;look elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite useless; I have never made a mistake; no one but myself arranges
      any papers of mine of this nature; no one but myself ever opens this
      drawer, of which, besides, no one, myself excepted, is aware of the
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you conclude, then?&rdquo; said Aramis, agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Mazarin&rsquo;s receipt has been stolen from me; Madame de Chevreuse was
      right, chevalier; I have appropriated the public funds, I have robbed the
      state coffers of thirteen millions of money; I am a thief, Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Herblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, do not get irritated&mdash;do not get excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, chevalier? surely there is every reason for it. If legal
      proceedings are well arranged, and a judgment given in accordance with
      them, your friend the superintendent will soon follow Montfaucon, his
      colleague Enguerrand de Marigny, and his predecessor, Semblancay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Aramis, smiling, &ldquo;not so fast as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not? why not so fast? What do you suppose Madame de Chevreuse has
      done with those letters&mdash;for you refused them, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; at once. I suppose that she went and sold them to M. Colbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I supposed so; I might have said I was sure of it, for I had her
      followed, and, when she left me, she returned to her own house, went out
      by a back door, and proceeded straight to the intendant&rsquo;s house in the Rue
      Croix des Petits-Champs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legal proceedings will be instituted, then, scandal and dishonor will
      follow; and all will fall upon me like a thunderbolt, blindly,
      pitilessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis approached Fouquet, who sat trembling in his chair, close to the
      open drawers; he placed his hand on his shoulder, and in an affectionate
      tone of voice, said: &ldquo;Do not forget that the position of M. Fouquet can in
      no way be compared to that of Semblancay or of Marigny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, in Heaven&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the proceedings against those ministers were determined,
      completed, and the sentence carried out, whilst in your case the same
      thing cannot take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another blow, why not? A peculator is, under any circumstances, a
      criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Criminals who know how to find a safe asylum are never in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! make my escape? Fly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not mean that; you forget that all such proceedings originate in
      the parliament, that they are instituted by the procureur-general, and
      that you are the procureur-general. You see that, unless you wish to
      condemn yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Fouquet, suddenly, dashing his fist upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what? what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am procureur-general no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, at this reply, became as livid as death; he pressed his hands
      together convulsively, and with a wild, haggard look, which almost
      annihilated Fouquet, he said, laying a stress on every distinct syllable,
      &ldquo;You are procureur-general no longer, do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the last four or five hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; interrupted Aramis, coldly; &ldquo;I do not think you are in the
      full possession of your senses, my friend; collect yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; returned Fouquet, &ldquo;that a little while ago, some one came to
      me, brought by my friends, to offer me fourteen hundred thousand francs
      for the appointment, and that I sold it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked as though he had been struck by lightning; the intelligent
      and mocking expression of his countenance assumed an aspect of such
      profound gloom and terror, that it had more effect upon the superintendent
      than all the exclamations and speeches in the world. &ldquo;You had need of
      money, then?&rdquo; he said, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; to discharge a debt of honor.&rdquo; And in a few words, he gave Aramis an
      account of Madame de Belliere&rsquo;s generosity, and the manner in which he had
      thought it but right to discharge that act of generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;that is, indeed, a fine trait. What has it cost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly the fourteen hundred thousand francs&mdash;the price of my
      appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you received in that manner, without reflection. Oh, imprudent
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not yet received the amount, but I shall to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not yet completed, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be carried out, though; for I have given the goldsmith, for
      twelve o&rsquo;clock to-morrow, an order upon my treasury, into which the
      purchaser&rsquo;s money will be paid at six or seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; cried Aramis, clapping his hands together, &ldquo;nothing
      is yet completed, since you have not yet been paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the goldsmith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall receive the fourteen hundred thousand francs from me, at a
      quarter before twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a moment; it is at six o&rsquo;clock, this very morning, that I am to
      sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I will answer that you do not sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given my word, chevalier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have given it, you will take it back again, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I believe what I hear?&rdquo; cried Fouquet, in a most expressive tone.
      &ldquo;Fouquet recall his word, after it has once been pledged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis replied to the almost stern look of the minister by a look full of
      anger. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe I have deserved to be called a man
      of honor? As a soldier, I have risked my life five hundred times; as a
      priest I have rendered still greater services, both to the state and to my
      friends. The value of a word, once passed, is estimated according to the
      worth of the man who gives it. So long as it is in his own keeping, it is
      of the purest, finest gold; when his wish to keep it has passed away, it
      is a two-edged sword. With that word, therefore, he defends himself as
      with an honorable weapon, considering that, when he disregards his word,
      he endangers his life and incurs an amount of risk far greater than that
      which his adversary is likely to derive of profit. In such a case,
      monsieur, he appeals to Heaven and to justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet bent down his head, as he replied, &ldquo;I am a poor, self-determined
      man, a true Breton born; my mind admires and fears yours. I do not say
      that I keep my word from a proper feeling only; I keep it, if you like,
      from custom, practice, pride, or what you will; but, at all events, the
      ordinary run of men are simple enough to admire this custom of mine; it is
      my sole good quality&mdash;leave me such honor as it confers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are determined to sign the sale of the very appointment which
      can alone defend you against all your enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will deliver yourself up, then, bound hand and foot, from a false
      notion of honor, which the most scrupulous casuists would disdain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sign,&rdquo; repeated Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis sighed deeply, and looked all round him with the impatient gesture
      of a man who would gladly dash something to pieces, as a relief to his
      feelings. &ldquo;We have still one means left,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I trust you will
      not refuse me to make use of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, if it be loyal and honorable; as everything is, in fact,
      which you propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing more loyal than the renunciation of your purchaser. Is he
      a friend of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly: but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But!&rsquo;&mdash;if you allow me to manage the affair, I do not despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you shall be absolutely master to do what you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom are you in treaty with? What manner of man is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not aware whether you know the parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of its members. One of the presidents, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only a counselor, of the name of Vanel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis became perfectly purple. &ldquo;Vanel!&rdquo; he cried, rising abruptly from
      his seat; &ldquo;Vanel! the husband of Marguerite Vanel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your former mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear fellow; she is anxious to be the wife of the
      procureur-general. I certainly owed poor Vanel that slight concession, and
      I am a gainer by it; since I, at the same time, can confer a pleasure on
      his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis walked straight up to Fouquet, and took hold of his hand. &ldquo;Do you
      know,&rdquo; he said, very calmly, &ldquo;the name of Madame Vanel&rsquo;s new lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! she has a new lover, then? I was not aware of it; no, I have no idea
      what his name is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is M. Jean-Baptiste Colbert; he is intendant of the finances: he
      lives in the Rue Croix des Petits-Champs, where Madame de Chevreuse has
      been this evening to take him Mazarin&rsquo;s letters, which she wishes to
      sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious Heaven!&rdquo; murmured Fouquet, passing his hand across his forehead,
      from which the perspiration was starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You now begin to understand, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am utterly lost!&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you now think it worth while to be so scrupulous with regard to
      keeping your word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These obstinate people always contrive matters in such a way, that one
      cannot but admire them all the while,&rdquo; murmured Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet held out his hand to him, and, at the very moment, a richly
      ornamented tortoise-shell clock, supported by golden figures, which was
      standing on a console table opposite to the fireplace, struck six. The
      sound of a door being opened in the vestibule was heard, and Gourville
      came to the door of the cabinet to inquire if Fouquet would received M.
      Vanel. Fouquet turned his eyes from the gaze of Aramis, and then desired
      that M. Vanel should be shown in.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIX. Monsieur Colbert&rsquo;s Rough Draft.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Vanel, who entered at this stage of the conversation, was nothing less for
      Aramis and Fouquet than the full stop which completes a phrase. But, for
      Vanel, Aramis&rsquo;s presence in Fouquet&rsquo;s cabinet had quite another
      signification; and, therefore, at his first step into the room, he paused
      as he looked at the delicate yet firm features of the bishop of Vannes,
      and his look of astonishment soon became one of scrutinizing attention. As
      for Fouquet, a perfect politician, that is to say, complete master of
      himself, he had already, by the energy of his own resolute will, contrived
      to remove from his face all traces of the emotion which Aramis&rsquo;s
      revelation had occasioned. He was no longer, therefore, a man overwhelmed
      by misfortune and reduced to resort to expedients; he held his head
      proudly erect, and indicated by a gesture that Vanel could enter. He was
      now the first minister of the state, and in his own palace. Aramis knew
      the superintendent well; the delicacy of the feelings of his heart and the
      exalted nature of his mind no longer surprised him. He confined himself,
      then, for the moment&mdash;intending to resume later an active part in the
      conversation&mdash;to the performance of the difficult part of a man who
      looks on and listens, in order to learn and understand. Vanel was visibly
      overcome, and advanced into the middle of the cabinet, bowing to
      everything and everybody. &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are punctual, Monsieur Vanel,&rdquo; returned Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In matters of business, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Vanel, &ldquo;I look upon
      exactitude as a virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; interrupted Aramis, indicating Vanel with his finger,
      but addressing himself to Fouquet; &ldquo;this is the gentleman, I believe, who
      has come about the purchase of your appointment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied Vanel, astonished at the extremely haughty tone in
      which Aramis had put the question; &ldquo;but in what way am I to address you,
      who do me the honor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Aramis, dryly. Vanel bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, gentlemen, a truce to these ceremonies; let us proceed to the
      matter itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur sees,&rdquo; said Vanel, &ldquo;that I am waiting your pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I am waiting,&rdquo; replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for, may I be permitted to ask, monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you had perhaps something to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Vanel to himself, &ldquo;he has reflected on the matter and I am
      lost.&rdquo; But resuming his courage, he continued, &ldquo;No, monseigneur, nothing,
      absolutely nothing more than what I said to you yesterday, and which I am
      again ready to repeat to you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now, tell me frankly, Monsieur Vanel, is not the affair rather a
      burdensome one for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, monseigneur; fourteen hundred thousand francs is an important
      sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So important, indeed,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;that I have reflected&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been reflecting, do you say, monseigneur?&rdquo; exclaimed Vanel,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that you might not yet be in a position to purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not make yourself uneasy on that score, Monsieur Vanel; I shall not
      blame you for a failure in your word, which evidently may arise from
      inability on your part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, monseigneur, you would blame me, and you would be right in doing
      so,&rdquo; said Vanel; &ldquo;for a man must either be very imprudent, or a fool, to
      undertake engagements which he cannot keep; and I, at least, have always
      regarded a thing agreed on as a thing actually carried out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet colored, while Aramis uttered a &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be wrong to exaggerate such notions as those, monsieur,&rdquo; said
      the superintendent; &ldquo;for a man&rsquo;s mind is variable, and full of these very
      excusable caprices, which are, however, sometimes estimable enough; and a
      man may have wished for something yesterday of which he repents to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vanel felt a cold sweat trickle down his face. &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, who was delighted to find the superintendent carry on the debate
      with such clearness and precision, stood leaning his arm upon the marble
      top of a console table and began to play with a small gold knife, with a
      malachite handle. Fouquet did not hasten to reply; but after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause, &ldquo;Come, my dear Monsieur Vanel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will explain to you how
      I am situated.&rdquo; Vanel began to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday I wished to sell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur did more than wish to sell, he actually sold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, that may be so; but to-day I ask you the favor to restore me
      my word which I pledged you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received your <i>word</i> as a satisfactory assurance that it would be
      kept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, and that is the reason why I now entreat you; do you
      understand me? I entreat you to restore it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet suddenly paused. The words &ldquo;I entreat you,&rdquo; the effect of which he
      did not immediately perceive, seemed almost to choke him as he uttered it.
      Aramis, still playing with his knife, fixed a look upon Vanel which seemed
      as if he wished to penetrate the recesses of his heart. Vanel simply
      bowed, as he said, &ldquo;I am overcome, monseigneur, at the honor you do me to
      consult me upon a matter of business which is already completed; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, do not say <i>but</i>, dear Monsieur Vanel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! monseigneur, you see,&rdquo; he said, as he opened a large pocket-book,
      &ldquo;I have brought the money with me,&mdash;the whole sum, I mean. And here,
      monseigneur, is the contract of sale which I have just effected of a
      property belonging to my wife. The order is authentic in every particular,
      the necessary signatures have been attached to it, and it is made payable
      at sight; it is ready money, in fact, and, in one word, the whole affair
      is complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Monsieur Vanel, there is not a matter of business in this world,
      however important it may be, which cannot be postponed in order to oblige
      a man, who, by that means, might and would be made a devoted friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Vanel, awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And much more justly acquired would that friend become, Monsieur Vanel,
      since the value of the service he had received would have been so
      considerable. Well, what do you say? what do you decide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vanel preserved a perfect silence. In the meantime, Aramis had continued
      his close observation of the man. Vanel&rsquo;s narrow face, his deeply sunken
      eyes, his arched eyebrows, had revealed to the bishop of Vannes the type
      of an avaricious and ambitious character. Aramis&rsquo;s method was to oppose
      one passion by another. He saw that M. Fouquet was defeated&mdash;morally
      subdued&mdash;and so he came to his rescue with fresh weapons in his
      hands. &ldquo;Excuse me, monseigneur,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you forgot to show M. Vanel
      that his own interests are diametrically opposed to this renunciation of
      the sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vanel looked at the bishop with astonishment; he had hardly expected to
      find an auxiliary in him. Fouquet also paused to listen to the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see,&rdquo; continued Aramis, &ldquo;that M. Vanel, in order to purchase
      your appointment, has been obliged to sell a property belonging to his
      wife; well, that is no slight matter; for one cannot displace, as he has
      done, fourteen or fifteen hundred thousand francs without some
      considerable loss, and very serious inconvenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true,&rdquo; said Vanel, whose secret Aramis had, with keen-sighted
      gaze, wrung from the bottom of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inconveniences such as these are matters of great expense and
      calculation, and whenever a man has money matters to deal with, the
      expenses are generally the very first thing thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Fouquet, who began to understand Aramis&rsquo;s meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanel remained perfectly silent; he, too, had understood him. Aramis
      observed his coldness of manner and his silence. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he said to
      himself, &ldquo;you are waiting, I see, until you know the amount; but do not
      fear, I shall send you such a flight of crowns that you cannot but
      capitulate on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must offer M. Vanel a hundred thousand crowns at once,&rdquo; said Fouquet,
      carried away by his generous feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sum was a good one. A prince, even, would have been satisfied with
      such a bonus. A hundred thousand crowns at that period was the dowry of a
      king&rsquo;s daughter. Vanel, however, did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a perfect rascal!&rdquo; thought the bishop, &ldquo;well, we must offer the
      five hundred thousand francs at once,&rdquo; and he made a sign to Fouquet
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have spent more than that, dear Monsieur Vanel,&rdquo; said the
      superintendent. &ldquo;The price of ready money is enormous. You must have made
      a great sacrifice in selling your wife&rsquo;s property. Well, what can I have
      been thinking of? I ought to have offered to sign you an order for five
      hundred thousand francs; and even in that case I shall feel that I am
      greatly indebted to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a gleam of delight or desire on Vanel&rsquo;s face, which remained
      perfectly impassible; not a muscle of it changed in the slightest degree.
      Aramis cast a look almost of despair at Fouquet, and then, going straight
      up to Vanel and taking hold of him by the coat, in a familiar manner, he
      said, &ldquo;Monsieur Vanel, it is neither the inconvenience, nor the
      displacement of your money, nor the sale of your wife&rsquo;s property even,
      that you are thinking of at this moment; it is something more important
      still. I can well understand it; so pay particular attention to what I am
      going to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur,&rdquo; Vanel replied, beginning to tremble in every limb, as
      the prelate&rsquo;s eyes seemed almost ready to devour him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offer you, therefore, in the superintendent&rsquo;s name, not three hundred
      thousand livres, nor five hundred thousand, but a million. A million&mdash;do
      you understand me?&rdquo; he added, as he shook him nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million!&rdquo; repeated Vanel, as pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million; in other words, at the present rate of interest, an income of
      seventy thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, monsieur,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;you can hardly refuse that. Answer&mdash;do
      you accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; murmured Vanel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis bit his lips, and something like a cloud seemed to pass over his
      face. The thunder behind this cloud could easily be imagined. He still
      kept his hold on Vanel. &ldquo;You have purchased the appointment for fifteen
      hundred thousand francs, I think. Well, you will receive these fifteen
      hundred thousand francs back again; by paying M. Fouquet a visit, and
      shaking hands with him on the bargain, you will have become a gainer of a
      million and a half. You get honor and profit at the same time, Monsieur
      Vanel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot do it,&rdquo; said Vanel, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Aramis, who had grasped Vanel so tightly by the coat
      that, when he let go his hold, Vanel staggered back a few paces, &ldquo;very
      well; one can now see clearly enough your object in coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;one can easily see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Vanel, attempting to stand erect before the weakness of
      these two men of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the fellow presume to speak?&rdquo; said Aramis, with the tone of an
      emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow!&rdquo; repeated Vanel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrel, I meant to say,&rdquo; added Aramis, who had now resumed his
      usual self-possession. &ldquo;Come, monsieur, produce your deed of sale,&mdash;you
      have it about you, I suppose, in one of your pockets, already prepared, as
      an assassin holds his pistol or his dagger concealed under his cloak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vanel began to mutter something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; cried Fouquet. &ldquo;Where is this deed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vanel tremblingly searched in his pockets, and as he drew out his
      pocket-book, a paper fell out of it, while Vanel offered the other to
      Fouquet. Aramis pounced upon the paper which had fallen out, as soon as he
      recognized the handwriting. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Vanel, &ldquo;that is a
      rough draft of the deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that very clearly,&rdquo; retorted Aramis, with a smile more cutting than
      a lash of a whip; &ldquo;and what I admire most is, that this draft is in M.
      Colbert&rsquo;s handwriting. Look, monseigneur, look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he handed the draft to Fouquet, who recognized the truth of the fact;
      for, covered with erasures, with inserted words, the margins filled with
      additions, this deed&mdash;a living proof of Colbert&rsquo;s plot&mdash;had just
      revealed everything to its unhappy victim. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; murmured Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanel, completely humiliated, seemed as if he were looking for some hole
      wherein to hide himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;if your name were not Fouquet, and if your enemy&rsquo;s
      name were not Colbert&mdash;if you had not this mean thief before you, I
      should say to you, &lsquo;Repudiate it;&rsquo; such a proof as this absolves you from
      your word; but these fellows would think you were afraid; they would fear
      you less than they do; therefore sign the deed at once.&rdquo; And he held out a
      pen towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet pressed Aramis&rsquo;s hand; but, instead of the deed which Vanel handed
      to him, he took the rough draft of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that paper,&rdquo; said Aramis, hastily; &ldquo;this is the one. The other is
      too precious a document for you to part with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; replied Fouquet; &ldquo;I will sign under M. Colbert&rsquo;s own handwriting
      even; and I write, &lsquo;The handwriting is approved of.&rsquo;&rdquo; He then signed, and
      said, &ldquo;Here it is, Monsieur Vanel.&rdquo; And the latter seized the paper,
      dashed down the money, and was about to make his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Aramis. &ldquo;Are you quite sure the exact amount is there?
      It ought to be counted over, Monsieur Vanel; particularly since M. Colbert
      makes presents of money to ladies, I see. Ah, that worthy M. Colbert is
      not so generous as M. Fouquet.&rdquo; And Aramis, spelling every word, every
      letter of the order to pay, distilled his wrath and his contempt, drop by
      drop, upon the miserable wretch, who had to submit to this torture for a
      quarter of an hour. He was then dismissed, not in words, but by a gesture,
      as one dismisses or discharges a beggar or a menial.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Vanel had gone, the minister and the prelate, their eyes fixed
      on each other, remained silent for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Aramis, the first to break the silence; &ldquo;to what can that man
      be compared, who, at the very moment he is on the point of entering into a
      conflict with an enemy armed from head to foot, panting for his life,
      presents himself for the contest utterly defenseless, throws down his
      arms, and smiles and kisses his hands to his adversary in the most
      gracious manner? Good faith, M. Fouquet, is a weapon which scoundrels
      frequently make use of against men of honor, and it answers their purpose.
      Men of honor, ought, in their turn, also, to make use of dishonest means
      against such scoundrels. You would soon see how strong they would become,
      without ceasing to be men of honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What they did would be termed the acts of a scoundrel,&rdquo; replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from that; it would be merely coquetting or playing with the truth.
      At all events, since you have finished with this Vanel; since you have
      deprived yourself of the happiness of confounding him by repudiating your
      word; and since you have given up, for the purpose of being used against
      yourself, the only weapon which can ruin you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Fouquet, mournfully, &ldquo;you are like the teacher of
      philosophy whom La Fontaine was telling us about the other day; he saw a
      child drowning, and began to read him a lecture divided into three heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis smiled as he said, &ldquo;Philosophy&mdash;yes; teacher&mdash;yes; a
      drowning child&mdash;yes; but a child can be saved&mdash;you shall see.
      But first of all let us talk about business. Did you not some time ago,&rdquo;
       he continued, as Fouquet looked at him with a bewildered air, &ldquo;speak to me
      about an idea you had of giving a <i>fete</i> at Vaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Fouquet, &ldquo;that was when affairs were flourishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A <i>fete</i>, I believe, to which the king invited himself of his own
      accord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear prelate; a <i>fete</i> to which M. Colbert advised the
      king to invite himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;exactly; as it would be a <i>fete</i> of so costly a character
      that you would be ruined in giving it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely so. In happier days, as I said just now, I had a kind of pride
      in showing my enemies how inexhaustible my resources were; I felt it a
      point of honor to strike them with amazement, by creating millions under
      circumstances where they imagined nothing but bankruptcies and failures
      would follow. But, at present, I am arranging my accounts with the state,
      with the king, with myself; and I must now become a mean, stingy man; I
      shall be able to prove to the world that I can act or operate with my
      deniers as I used to do with my bags of pistoles, and from to-morrow my
      equipages shall be sold, my mansions mortgaged, my expenses curtailed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From to-morrow,&rdquo; interrupted Aramis, quietly, &ldquo;you will occupy yourself,
      without the slightest delay, with your <i>fete</i> at Vaux, which must
      hereafter be spoken of as one of the most magnificent productions of your
      most prosperous days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, Chevalier d&rsquo;Herblay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, then? Do you not know that a <i>fete</i> at Vaux, one
      of the very simplest possible character, would cost four or five
      millions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not speak of a <i>fete</i> of the very simplest possible character,
      my dear superintendent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, since the <i>fete</i> is to be given to the king,&rdquo; replied Fouquet,
      who misunderstood Aramis&rsquo;s idea, &ldquo;it cannot be simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so: it ought to be on a scale of the most unbounded magnificence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I shall have to spend ten or twelve millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall spend twenty, if you require it,&rdquo; said Aramis, in a perfectly
      calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I get them?&rdquo; exclaimed Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my affair, monsieur le surintendant; and do not be uneasy for a
      moment about it. The money shall be placed at once at your disposal, the
      moment you have arranged the plans of your <i>fete</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chevalier! chevalier!&rdquo; said Fouquet, giddy with amazement, &ldquo;whither are
      you hurrying me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Across the gulf into which you were about to fall,&rdquo; replied the bishop of
      Vannes. &ldquo;Take hold of my cloak, and throw fear aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not tell me that sooner, Aramis? There was a day when, with
      one million only, you could have saved me; whilst to-day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whilst to-day I can give you twenty,&rdquo; said the prelate. &ldquo;Such is the
      case, however&mdash;the reason is very simple. On the day you speak of, I
      had not the million which you had need of at my disposal, whilst now I can
      easily procure the twenty millions we require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven hear you, and save me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis resumed his usual smile, the expression of which was so singular.
      &ldquo;Heaven never fails to hear me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I abandon myself to you unreservedly,&rdquo; Fouquet murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I do not understand it in that manner. I am unreservedly devoted
      to you. Therefore, as you have the clearest, the most delicate, and the
      most ingenious mind of the two, you shall have entire control over the <i>fete</i>,
      even to the very smallest details. Only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only?&rdquo; said Fouquet, as a man accustomed to understand and appreciate the
      value of a parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, leaving the entire invention of the details to you, I shall
      reserve to myself a general superintendence over the execution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, that you will make of me, on that day, a major-domo, a sort of
      inspector-general, or factotum&mdash;something between a captain of the
      guard and manager or steward. I will look after the people, and will keep
      the keys of the doors. You will give your orders, of course: but will give
      them to no one but me. They will pass through my lips, to reach those for
      whom they are intended&mdash;you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am very far from understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you agree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I care about, then. Thanks; and now go and prepare your list
      of invitations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom shall I invite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody you know.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter L: In Which the Author Thinks It Is High Time to Return to the
      Vicomte de Bragelonne.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our readers will have observed in this story, the adventures of the new
      and of the past generation being detailed, as it were, side by side. He
      will have noticed in the former, the reflection of the glory of earlier
      years, the experience of the bitter things of this world; in the former,
      also, that peace which takes possession of the heart, and that healing of
      the scars which were formerly deep and painful wounds. In the latter, the
      conflicts of love and vanity; bitter disappointments, ineffable delights;
      life instead of memory. If, therefore, any variety has been presented to
      the reader in the different episodes of this tale, it is to be attributed
      to the numerous shades of color which are presented on this double tablet,
      where two pictures are seen side by side, mingling and harmonizing their
      severe and pleasing tones. The repose of the emotions of one is found in
      harmonious contrast with the fiery sentiments of the other. After having
      talked reason with older heads, one loves to talk nonsense with youth.
      Therefore, if the threads of the story do not seem very intimately to
      connect the chapter we are now writing with the one we have just written,
      we do not intend to give ourselves any more thought or trouble about it
      than Ruysdael took in painting an autumn sky, after having finished a
      spring-time scene. We accordingly resume Raoul de Bragelonne&rsquo;s story at
      the very place where our last sketch left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a state of frenzy and dismay, or rather without power or will of his
      own,&mdash;hardly knowing what he was doing,&mdash;he fled swiftly, after
      the scene in La Valliere&rsquo;s chamber, that strange exclusion, Louise&rsquo;s
      grief, Montalais&rsquo;s terror, the king&rsquo;s wrath&mdash;all seemed to indicate
      some misfortune. But what? He had arrived from London because he had been
      told of the existence of a danger; and almost on his arrival this
      appearance of danger was manifest. Was not this sufficient for a lover?
      Certainly it was, but it was insufficient for a pure and upright heart
      such as his. And yet Raoul did not seek for explanations in the very
      quarter where more jealous or less timid lovers would have done. He did
      not go straightaway to his mistress, and say, &ldquo;Louise, is it true that you
      love me no longer? Is it true that you love another?&rdquo; Full of courage,
      full of friendship as he was full of love; a religious observer of his
      word, and believing blindly the word of others, Raoul said within himself,
      &ldquo;Guiche wrote to put me on my guard, Guiche knows something; I will go and
      ask Guiche what he knows, and tell him what I have seen.&rdquo; The journey was
      not a long one. Guiche, who had been brought from Fontainebleau to Paris
      within the last two days, was beginning to recover from his wounds, and to
      walk about a little in his room. He uttered a cry of joy as he saw Raoul,
      with the eagerness of friendship, enter the apartment. Raoul was unable to
      refrain from a cry of grief, when he saw De Guiche, so pale, so thin, so
      melancholy. A very few words, and a simple gesture which De Guiche made to
      put aside Raoul&rsquo;s arm, were sufficient to inform the latter of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so it is,&rdquo; said Raoul, seating himself beside his friend; &ldquo;one loves
      and dies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not dies,&rdquo; replied Guiche, smiling, &ldquo;since I am now recovering,
      and since, too, I can press you in my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I understand you, too. You fancy I am unhappy, Raoul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am the happiest of men. My body suffers, but not my mind or my
      heart. If you only knew&mdash;Oh! I am, indeed, the very happiest of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Raoul; &ldquo;so much the better, provided it lasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over. I have had enough happiness to last me to my dying day,
      Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt you have had; but she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen; I love her, because&mdash;but you are not listening to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mind is preoccupied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your health, in the first place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, you would be wrong. I think, to ask me any questions&mdash;<i>you</i>
      of all persons in the world;&rdquo; and he laid so much weight upon the &ldquo;you,&rdquo;
       that he completely enlightened his friend upon the nature of the evil, and
      the difficulty of remedying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that, Raoul, on account of what I wrote to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. We will talk over that matter a little, when you have finished
      telling me of all your own pleasures and your pains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, I am entirely at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I have hurried, I have flown here; I came in half the time the
      government couriers usually take. Now, tell me, my dear friend, what did
      you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever, but to make you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is quite right, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must have been something else, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Guiche!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot possibly have crushed all my hopes so violently, or have
      exposed me to being disgraced by the king for my return, which is in
      disobedience of his orders&mdash;you cannot, I say, have planted jealousy
      in my heart, merely to say to me, &lsquo;It is all right, be perfectly easy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say to you, Raoul, &lsquo;Be perfectly easy;&rsquo; but pray understand me;
      I never will, nor can I, indeed, tell you anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of person do you take me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know anything, why conceal it from me? If you do not know
      anything, why did you write so warningly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true, I was very wrong, and I regret having done so, Raoul. It
      seems nothing to write to a friend and say &lsquo;Come;&rsquo; but to have this friend
      face to face, to feel him tremble, and breathlessly and anxiously wait to
      hear what one hardly dare tell him, is very difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare! I have courage enough, if you have not,&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how unjust you are, and how soon you forget you have to do with a
      poor wounded fellow such as your unhappy friend is. So, calm yourself,
      Raoul. I said to you, &lsquo;Come&rsquo;&mdash;you are here, so ask me nothing
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your object in telling me to come was your hope that I should see with my
      own eyes, was it not? Nay, do not hesitate, for I have seen all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or at least I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now, you see you are not sure. But if you have any doubt, my poor
      friend, what remains for me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Louise much agitated&mdash;Montalais in a state of bewilderment&mdash;the
      king&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You turn your head aside. The danger is there, the evil is there;
      tell me, is it not so, is it not the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you say a thousand times more than nothing. Give me facts, for pity&rsquo;s
      sake, give me proofs. My friend, the only friend I have, speak&mdash;tell
      me all. My heart is crushed, wounded to death; I am dying from despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that really be so, as I see it is, indeed, dear Raoul,&rdquo; replied De
      Guiche, &ldquo;you relieve me from my difficulty, and I will tell you all,
      perfectly sure that I can tell you nothing but what is consoling, compared
      to the despair from which I see you suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&mdash;go on; I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I can only tell you what you might learn from every one you
      meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From every one, do you say? It is talked about, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you say people talk about it, learn what it is that people have to
      talk about. I assure you solemnly, that people only talk about what may,
      in truth, be very innocent; perhaps a walk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! a walk with the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly, a walk with the king; and I believe the king has already
      very frequently before taken walks with ladies, without on that account&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not have written to me, shall I say again, if there had been
      nothing unusual in this promenade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that while the storm lasted, it would have been far better if the
      king had taken shelter somewhere else, than to have remained with his head
      uncovered before La Valliere; but the king is so very courteous and
      polite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! De Guiche, De Guiche, you are killing me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not let us talk any more, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, let us continue. This walk was followed by others, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I mean yes: there was the adventure of the oak, I think. But I
      know nothing about the matter at all.&rdquo; Raoul rose; De Guiche endeavored to
      imitate him, notwithstanding his weakness. &ldquo;Well, I will not add another
      word: I have said either too much or not enough. Let others give you
      further information if they will, or if they can; my duty was to warn you,
      and <i>that</i> I have done. Watch over your own affairs now, yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Question others! Alas! you are no true friend to speak to me in that
      manner,&rdquo; said the young man, in utter distress. &ldquo;The first man I meet may
      be either evilly disposed or a fool,&mdash;if the former, he will tell me
      a lie to make me suffer more than I do now; if the latter, he will do
      worse still. Ah! De Guiche, De Guiche, before two hours are over, I shall
      have been told ten falsehoods, and shall have as many duels on my hands.
      Save me, then; is it not best to know the worst always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know nothing, I tell you; I was wounded, attacked by fever: out of
      my senses; and I have only a very faint recollection of it all. But there
      is no reason why we should search very far, when the very man we want is
      close at hand. Is not D&rsquo;Artagnan your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! true, true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got to him, then. He will be able to throw sufficient light upon the
      subject.&rdquo; At this moment a lackey entered the room. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said De
      Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one is waiting for monseigneur in the Cabinet des Porcelaines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Will you excuse me, my dear Raoul? I am so proud since I have
      been able to walk again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would offer you my arm, De Guiche, if I did not guess that the person
      in question is a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; said De Guiche, smiling as he quitted Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul remained motionless, absorbed in grief, overwhelmed, like the miner
      upon whom a vault has just fallen in, who, wounded, his life-blood welling
      fast, his thoughts confused, endeavors to recover himself, to save his
      life and to retain his reason. A few minutes were all Raoul needed to
      dissipate the bewildering sensations occasioned by these two revelations.
      He had already recovered the thread of his ideas, when, suddenly, through
      the door, he fancied he recognized Montalais&rsquo;s voice in the Cabinet des
      Porcelaines. &ldquo;She!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Yes, it is indeed her voice! She will be
      able to tell me the whole truth; but shall I question her here? She
      conceals herself even from me; she is coming, no doubt, from Madame. I
      will see her in her own apartment. She will explain her alarm, her flight,
      the strange manner in which I was driven out; she will tell me all that&mdash;after
      M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, who knows everything, shall have given me a fresh strength
      and courage. Madame, a coquette I fear, and yet a coquette who is herself
      in love, has her moments of kindness; a coquette who is as capricious and
      uncertain as life or death, but who tells De Guiche that he is the
      happiest of men. He at least is lying on roses.&rdquo; And so he hastily quitted
      the comte&rsquo;s apartments, reproaching himself as he went for having talked
      of nothing but his own affairs to De Guiche, and soon reached D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s
      quarters.

    <h2>
      Chapter LI. Bragelonne Continues His Inquiries.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The captain, sitting buried in his leathern armchair, his spurs fixed in
      the floor, his sword between his legs, was reading a number of letters, as
      he twisted his mustache. D&rsquo;Artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure
      when he perceived his friend&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Raoul, my boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by what
      lucky accident does it happen that the king has recalled you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words did not sound agreeably in the young man&rsquo;s ears, who, as he
      seated himself, replied, &ldquo;Upon my word I cannot tell you; all that I know
      is&mdash;I have come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, folding up his letters and directing a look full
      of meaning at him; &ldquo;what do you say, my boy? that the king has not
      recalled you, and you have returned? I do not understand that at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul was already pale enough; and he now began to turn his hat round and
      round in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is the matter that you look as you do, and what makes you
      so dumb?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Do people nowadays assume that sort of airs
      in England? I have been in England, and came here again as lively as a
      chaffinch. Will you not say something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have too much to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how is your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my dear friend, I was going to ask you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze, which no
      secret was capable of resisting. &ldquo;You are unhappy about something,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, indeed; and you know the reason very well, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Nay, do not pretend to be astonished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not pretending to be astonished, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear captain, I know very well that in all trials of <i>finesse</i>, as
      well as in all trials of strength, I shall be beaten by you. You can see
      that at the present moment I am an idiot, an absolute noodle. I have
      neither head nor arm; do not despise, but help me. In two words, I am the
      most wretched of living beings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh! why that?&rdquo; inquired D&rsquo;Artagnan, unbuckling his belt and thawing
      the asperity of his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Mademoiselle de la Valliere is deceiving me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is deceiving you,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, not a muscle of whose face had
      moved; &ldquo;those are big words. Who makes use of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if every one says so, there must be some truth in it. I begin to
      believe there is fire when I see smoke. It is ridiculous, perhaps, but it
      is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore you <i>do</i> believe me?&rdquo; exclaimed Bragelonne, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never mix myself up in affairs of that kind; you know that very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! not for a friend, for a son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. If you were a stranger, I should tell you&mdash;I will tell <i>you</i>
      nothing at all. How is Porthos, do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; cried Raoul, pressing D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I entreat you in the
      name of the friendship you vowed my father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce take it, you are really ill&mdash;from curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not from curiosity, it is from love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Another big word. If you were really in love, my dear Raoul, you
      would be very different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that if you were really so deeply in love that I could believe I
      was addressing myself to your heart&mdash;but it is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I love Louise to distraction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan could read to the very bottom of the young man&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, I tell you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are like all young men; you are
      not in love, you are out of your senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! suppose it were only that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head
      was turned. I have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred
      times in my life. You would listen to me, but you would not hear me! you
      would hear, but you would not understand me; you would understand, but you
      would not obey me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! try, try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go far. Even if I were unfortunate enough to know something, and
      foolish enough to communicate it to you&mdash;You are my friend, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I should quarrel with you. You would never forgive me for
      having destroyed your illusion, as people say in love affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, you know all; and yet you plunge me in perplexity
      and despair, in death itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never complain, as you know; but as Heaven and my father would never
      forgive me for blowing out my brains, I will go and get the first person I
      meet to give me the information which you withhold; I will tell him he
      lies, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would kill him. And a fine affair that would be. So much the
      better. What should I care? Kill any one you please, my boy, if it gives
      you any pleasure. It is exactly like a man with a toothache, who keeps on
      saying, &lsquo;Oh! what torture I am suffering. I could bite a piece of iron in
      half.&rsquo; My answer always is, &lsquo;Bite, my friend, bite; the tooth will remain
      all the same.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not kill any one, monsieur,&rdquo; said Raoul, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! you now assume a different tone: instead of killing, you will
      get killed yourself, I suppose you mean? Very fine, indeed! How much I
      should regret you! Of course I should go about all day, saying, &lsquo;Ah! what
      a fine stupid fellow that Bragelonne was! as great a stupid as I ever met
      with. I have passed my whole life almost in teaching him how to hold and
      use his sword properly, and the silly fellow has got himself spitted like
      a lark.&rsquo; Go, then, Raoul, go and get yourself disposed of, if you like. I
      hardly know who can have taught you logic, but deuce take me if your
      father has not been regularly robbed of his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul buried his face in his hands, murmuring: &ldquo;No, no; I have not a
      single friend in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! bah!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meet with nothing but raillery or indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idle fancies, monsieur. I do not laugh at you, although I am a Gascon.
      And, as for being indifferent, if I were so, I should have sent you about
      your business a quarter of an hour ago, for you would make a man who was
      out of his senses with delight as dull as possible, and would be the death
      of one who was out of spirits. How now, young man! do you wish me to
      disgust you with the girl you are attached to, and to teach you to
      execrate the whole sex who constitute the honor and happiness of human
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! tell me, monsieur, and I will bless you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, my dear fellow, that I can have crammed into my brain all
      about the carpenter, and the painter, and the staircase, and a hundred
      other similar tales of the same kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A carpenter! what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word I don&rsquo;t know; some one told me there was a carpenter who
      made an opening through a certain flooring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In La Valliere&rsquo;s room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the king&rsquo;s apartment, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if it were in the king&rsquo;s apartment, I should tell you, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In whose room, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you for the last hour that I know nothing of the whole
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the painter, then? the portrait&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that the king wished to have the portrait of one of the ladies
      belonging to the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you seem to have only that name in your mouth. Who spoke to you of
      La Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be not her portrait, then, why do you suppose it would concern me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not suppose it will concern you. But you ask me all sorts of
      questions, and I answer you. You positively will learn all the scandal of
      the affair, and I tell you&mdash;make the best you can of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul struck his forehead with his hand in utter despair. &ldquo;It will kill
      me!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have said already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right,&rdquo; and he made a step or two, as if he were going to
      leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look for some one who will tell me the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de la Valliere herself, I suppose you mean?&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a smile. &ldquo;Ah! a famous idea that! You wish to be consoled
      by some one, and you will be so at once. She will tell you nothing ill of
      herself, of course. So be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Raoul; &ldquo;the woman I mean will tell
      me all the evil she possibly can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You allude to Montalais, I suppose&mdash;her friend; a woman who, on that
      account, will exaggerate all that is either bad or good in the matter. Do
      not talk to Montalais, my good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some reasons for wishing me not to talk with Montalais?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I admit it. And, in point of fact, why should I play with you as a
      cat does with a poor mouse? You distress me, you do, indeed. And if I wish
      you not to speak to Montalais just now, it is because you will be
      betraying your secret, and people will take advantage of it. Wait, if you
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse. Why, you see, Raoul, if I had an idea,&mdash;but I
      have not got one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me that you will pity me, my friend, that is all I need, and
      leave me to get out of the affair by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, indeed, in order that you may get deeper into the mire! A
      capital idea, truly! go and sit down at that table and take a pen in your
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To write and ask Montalais to give you an interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Raoul, snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door opened, and one of the musketeers, approaching
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, said, &ldquo;Captain, Mademoiselle de Montalais is here, and wishes
      to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me?&rdquo; murmured D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;Ask her to come in; I shall soon see,&rdquo; he
      said to himself, &ldquo;whether she wishes to speak to me or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cunning captain was quite right in his suspicions; for as soon as
      Montalais entered she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, monsieur! monsieur! I beg your
      pardon, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I forgive you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;I know that, at my
      age, those who are looking for me generally need me for something or
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking for M. de Bragelonne,&rdquo; replied Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very fortunate that is; he was looking for you, too. Raoul, will you
      accompany Mademoiselle de Montalais?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go along, then,&rdquo; he said, as he gently pushed Raoul out of the cabinet;
      and then, taking hold of Montalais&rsquo;s hand, he said, in a low voice, &ldquo;Be
      kind towards him; spare him, and spare her, too, if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, in the same tone of voice, &ldquo;it is not I who am going to
      speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Madame who has sent for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;it is Madame, is it? In an hour&rsquo;s time,
      then, the poor fellow will be cured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else dead,&rdquo; said Montalais, in a voice full of compassion. &ldquo;Adieu,
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; she said; and she ran to join Raoul, who was waiting
      for her at a little distance from the door, very much puzzled and
      thoroughly uneasy at the dialogue, which promised no good augury for him.

    <h2>
      Chapter LII. Two Jealousies.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lovers are tender towards everything that forms part of the daily life of
      the object of their affection. Raoul no sooner found himself alone with
      Montalais, than he kissed her hand with rapture. &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; said the
      young girl, sadly, &ldquo;you are throwing your kisses away; I will guarantee
      that they will not bring you back any interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&mdash;Why?&mdash;Will you explain to me, my dear Aure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame will explain everything to you. I am going to take you to her
      apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! and throw away your dark and savage looks. The windows here have
      eyes, the walls have ears. Have the kindness not to look at me any longer;
      be good enough to speak to me aloud of the rain, of the fine weather, and
      of the charms of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events&mdash;&rdquo; interrupted Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, I warn you, that wherever people may be, I know not how,
      Madame is sure to have eyes and ears open. I am not very desirous, you can
      easily believe, of being dismissed or thrown in to the Bastile. Let us
      talk, I tell you, or rather, do not let us talk at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul clenched his hands, and tried to assume the look and gait of a man
      of courage, it is true, but of a man of courage on his way to the torture
      chamber. Montalais, glancing in every direction, walking along with an
      easy swinging gait, and holding up her head pertly in the air, preceded
      him to Madame&rsquo;s apartments, where he was at once introduced. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
      thought, &ldquo;this day will pass away without my learning anything. Guiche
      showed too much consideration for my feelings; he had no doubt come to an
      understanding with Madame, and both of them, by a friendly plot, agreed to
      postpone the solution of the problem. Why have I not a determined,
      inveterate enemy&mdash;that serpent, De Wardes, for instance; that he
      would bite, is very likely; but I should not hesitate any more. To
      hesitate, to doubt&mdash;better, far, to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Raoul was in Madame&rsquo;s presence. Henrietta, more charming
      than ever, was half lying, half reclining in her armchair, her small feet
      upon an embroidered velvet cushion; she was playing with a kitten with
      long silky fur, which was biting her fingers and hanging by the lace of
      her collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame seemed plunged in deep thought, so deep, indeed, that it required
      both Montalais and Raoul&rsquo;s voice to disturb her from her reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your highness sent for me?&rdquo; repeated Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame shook her head as if she were just awakening, and then said, &ldquo;Good
      morning, Monsieur de Bragelonne; yes, I sent for you; so you have returned
      from England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame, and am at your royal highness&rsquo;s commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; leave us, Montalais,&rdquo; and the latter immediately left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a few minutes to give me, Monsieur de Bragelonne, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life is at your royal highness&rsquo;s disposal,&rdquo; Raoul returned with
      respect, guessing that there was something serious in these unusual
      courtesies; nor was he displeased, indeed, to observe the seriousness of
      her manner, feeling persuaded that there was some sort of affinity between
      Madame&rsquo;s sentiments and his own. In fact, every one at court, of any
      perception at all, knew perfectly well the capricious fancy and absurd
      despotism of the princess&rsquo;s singular character. Madame had been flattered
      beyond all bounds by the king&rsquo;s attention; she had made herself talked
      about; she had inspired the queen with that mortal jealousy which is the
      stinging scorpion at the heel of every woman&rsquo;s happiness; Madame, in a
      word, in her attempts to cure a wounded pride, found that her heart had
      become deeply and passionately attached. We know what Madame had done to
      recall Raoul, who had been sent out of the way by Louis XIV. Raoul did not
      know of her letter to Charles II., although D&rsquo;Artagnan had guessed its
      contents. Who will undertake to account for that seemingly inexplicable
      mixture of love and vanity, that passionate tenderness of feeling, that
      prodigious duplicity of conduct? No one can, indeed; not even the bad
      angel who kindles the love of coquetry in the heart of a woman. &ldquo;Monsieur
      de Bragelonne,&rdquo; said the princess, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;have you
      returned satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bragelonne looked at Madame Henrietta, and seeing how pale she was, not
      alone from what she was keeping back, but also from what she was burning
      to say, said: &ldquo;Satisfied! what is there for me to be satisfied or
      dissatisfied about, Madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are those things with which a man of your age, and of your
      appearance, is usually either satisfied or dissatisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How eager she is,&rdquo; thought Raoul, almost terrified; &ldquo;what venom is it she
      is going to distil into my heart?&rdquo; and then, frightened at what she might
      possibly be going to tell him, and wishing to put off the opportunity of
      having everything explained, which he had hitherto so ardently wished for,
      yet had dreaded so much, he replied: &ldquo;I left, Madame, a dear friend in
      good health, and on my return I find him very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refer to M. de Guiche,&rdquo; replied Madame Henrietta, with imperturbable
      self-possession; &ldquo;I <i>have</i> heard he is a very dear friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, indeed, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is quite true he has been wounded; but he is better now. Oh! M.
      de Guiche is not to be pitied,&rdquo; she said hurriedly; and then, recovering
      herself, added, &ldquo;But has he anything to complain of? Has he complained of
      anything? Is there any cause of grief or sorrow that we are not acquainted
      with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I allude only to his wound, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better, then, for, in other respects, M. de Guiche seems to
      be very happy; he is always in very high spirits. I am sure that you,
      Monsieur de Bragelonne, would far prefer to be, like him, wounded only in
      the body... for what, in deed, is such a wound, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul started. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;she is returning to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say anything Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not say anything; you disapprove of my observation, then? you are
      perfectly satisfied, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul approached closer to her. &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your royal highness
      wishes to say something to me, and your instinctive kindness and
      generosity of disposition induce you to be careful and considerate as to
      your manner of conveying it. Will your royal highness throw this kind
      forbearance aside? I am able to bear everything; and I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied Henrietta, &ldquo;what do you understand, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which your royal highness wishes me to understand,&rdquo; said Raoul,
      trembling, notwithstanding his command over himself, as he pronounced
      these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In point of fact,&rdquo; murmured the princess... &ldquo;it seems cruel, but since I
      have begun&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame, once your highness has deigned to begin, will you condescend
      to finish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta rose hurriedly and walked a few paces up and down her room.
      &ldquo;What did M. de Guiche tell you?&rdquo; she said, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! Did he say nothing? Ah! how well I recognize him in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he wished to spare me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is what friends call friendship. But surely, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, whom
      you have just left, must have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than De Guiche, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta made a gesture full of impatience, as she said, &ldquo;At least, you
      know all the court knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing at all, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the scene in the storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the <i>tete-a-tete</i> in the forest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor the flight to Chaillot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, whose head dropped like a blossom cut down by the reaper, made an
      almost superhuman effort to smile, as he replied with the greatest
      gentleness: &ldquo;I have had the honor of telling your royal highness that I am
      absolutely ignorant of everything, that I am a poor unremembered outcast,
      who has this moment arrived from England. There have rolled so many stormy
      waves between myself and those I left behind me here, that the rumor of
      none of the circumstances your highness refers to, has been able to reach
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta was affected by his extreme pallor, his gentleness, and his
      great courage. The principal feeling in her heart at that moment was an
      eager desire to hear the nature of the remembrance which the poor lover
      retained of the woman who had made him suffer so much. &ldquo;Monsieur de
      Bragelonne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that which your friends have refused to do, I will
      do for you, whom I like and esteem very much. I will be your friend on
      this occasion. You hold your head high, as a man of honor should; and I
      deeply regret that you may have to bow before ridicule, and in a few days,
      it might be, contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, perfectly livid. &ldquo;It is as bad as that, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not know,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;I see that you guess; you were
      affianced, I believe, to Mademoiselle de la Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By that right, you deserve to be warned about her, as some day or another
      I shall be obliged to dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere from my service&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dismiss La Valliere!&rdquo; cried Bragelonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Do you suppose I shall always be amenable to the tears and
      protestations of the king? No, no! my house shall no longer be made a
      convenience for such practices; but you tremble, you cannot stand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madame, no,&rdquo; said Bragelonne, making an effort over himself; &ldquo;I
      thought I should have died just now, that was all. Your royal highness did
      me the honor to say that the king wept and implored you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but in vain,&rdquo; returned the princess; who then related to Raoul the
      scene that took place at Chaillot, and the king&rsquo;s despair on his return;
      she told him of his indulgence to herself and the terrible word with which
      the outraged princess, the humiliated coquette, had quashed the royal
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul stood with his head bent down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it all?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king loves her,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you seem to think she does not love him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, Madame, I was thinking of the time when she loved <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta was for a moment struck with admiration at this sublime
      disbelief: and then, shrugging her shoulders, she said, &ldquo;You do not
      believe me, I see. How deeply you must love her. And you doubt if she
      loves the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, until I have a proof of it. Forgive me, Madame, but she has given
      me her word; and her mind and heart are too upright to tell a falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You require a proof! Be it so. Come with me, then.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter LIII. A Domiciliary Visit.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The princess, preceding Raoul, led him through the courtyard towards that
      part of the building La Valliere inhabited, and, ascending the same
      staircase which Raoul himself had ascended that very morning, she paused
      at the door of the room in which the young man had been so strangely
      received by Montalais. The opportunity was remarkably well chosen to carry
      out the project Madame Henrietta had conceived, for the chateau was empty.
      The king, the courtiers, and the ladies of the court, had set off for
      Saint-Germain; Madame Henrietta was the only one who knew of Bragelonne&rsquo;s
      return, and thinking over the advantages which might be drawn from this
      return, she had feigned indisposition in order to remain behind. Madame
      was therefore confident of finding La Valliere&rsquo;s room and Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s
      apartment perfectly empty. She took a pass-key from her pocket and opened
      the door of her maid of honor&rsquo;s apartment. Bragelonne&rsquo;s gaze was
      immediately fixed upon the interior of the room, which he recognized at
      once; and the impression which the sight of it produced upon him was
      torture. The princess looked at him, and her practiced eye at once
      detected what was passing in the young man&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked for proofs,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;do not be astonished, then, if I give
      you them. But if you do not think you have courage enough to confront
      them, there is still time to withdraw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Madame,&rdquo; said Bragelonne; &ldquo;but I came here to be convinced.
      You promised to convince me,&mdash;do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter, then,&rdquo; said Madame, &ldquo;and shut the door behind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bragelonne obeyed, and then turned towards the princess, whom he
      interrogated by a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know where you are, I suppose?&rdquo; inquired Madame Henrietta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything leads me to believe I am in Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would observe to your highness, that this room is a room, and is
      not a proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said the princess, as she walked to the foot of the bed, folded up
      the screen into its several compartments, and stooped down towards the
      floor. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;stoop down and lift up this trap-door
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trap-door!&rdquo; said Raoul, astonished; for D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s words began to
      return to his memory, and he had an indistinct recollection that
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had made use of the same word. He looked, but uselessly, for
      some cleft or crevice which might indicate an opening or a ring to assist
      in lifting up the planking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I forgot,&rdquo; said Madame Henrietta, &ldquo;I forgot the secret spring; the
      fourth plank of the flooring,&mdash;press on the spot where you will
      observe a knot in the wood. Those are the instructions; press, vicomte!
      press, I say, yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, pale as death, pressed his finger on the spot which had been
      indicated to him; at the same moment the spring began to work, and the
      trap rose of its own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ingenious enough, certainly,&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;and one can see
      that the architect foresaw that a woman&rsquo;s hand only would have to make use
      of this spring, for see how easily the trap-door opened without
      assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A staircase!&rdquo; cried Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a very pretty one, too,&rdquo; said Madame Henrietta. &ldquo;See, vicomte,
      the staircase has a balustrade, intended to prevent the falling of timid
      persons, who might be tempted to descend the staircase; and I will risk
      myself on it accordingly. Come, vicomte, follow me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before following you, madame, may I ask where this staircase leads
      to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, true; I forgot to tell you. You know, perhaps, that formerly M. de
      Saint-Aignan lived in the very next apartment to the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame, I am aware of that; that was the arrangement, at least,
      before I left; and more than once I had the honor of visiting his rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he obtained the king&rsquo;s leave to change his former convenient and
      beautiful apartment for the two rooms to which this staircase will conduct
      us, and which together form a lodging for him half the size, and at ten
      times greater the distance from the king,&mdash;a close proximity to whom
      is by no means disdained, in general, by the gentlemen belonging to the
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Madame,&rdquo; returned Raoul; &ldquo;but go on, I beg, for I do not
      understand yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then it accidentally happened,&rdquo; continued the princess, &ldquo;that M. de
      Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s apartment is situated underneath the apartments of my maids
      of honor, and by a further coincidence, exactly underneath the room of La
      Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was the motive of this trap-door and this staircase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I cannot tell you. Would you like to go down to Monsieur de
      Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s rooms? Perhaps we shall be able to find the solution of the
      enigma there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Madame set the example by going down herself, while Raoul, sighing
      deeply, followed her. At every step Bragelonne took, he advanced further
      into that mysterious apartment which had witnessed La Valliere&rsquo;s sighs and
      still retained the perfume of her presence. Bragelonne fancied he
      perceived, as he inhaled the atmosphere, that the young girl must have
      passed through. Then succeeded to these emanations of herself, which he
      regarded as invisible though certain proofs, flowers she preferred to all
      others&mdash;books of her own selection. If Raoul retained a single doubt
      on the subject, it would have vanished at the secret harmony of tastes and
      connection of the mind with the ordinary objects of life. La Valliere, in
      Bragelonne&rsquo;s eyes, was present there in each article of furniture, in the
      color of the hangings, in all that surrounded him. Dumb, and now
      completely overwhelmed, there was nothing further for him now to learn,
      and he followed his pitiless conductress as blindly as the culprit follows
      the executioner; while Madame, as cruel as women of overstrung
      temperaments generally are, did not spare him the slightest detail. But it
      must be admitted that, notwithstanding the kind of apathy into which he
      had fallen, none of these details, even had he been left alone, would have
      escaped him. The happiness of the woman who loves, when that happiness is
      derived from a rival, is a living torture for a jealous man; but for a
      jealous man such as Raoul was, for one whose heart for the first time in
      its existence was being steeped in gall and bitterness, Louise&rsquo;s happiness
      was in reality an ignominious death, a death of body and soul. He guessed
      all; he fancied he could see them, with their hands clasped in each
      other&rsquo;s, their faces drawn close together, and reflected, side by side, in
      loving proximity, and they gazed upon the mirrors around them&mdash;so
      sweet an occupation for lovers, who, as they thus see themselves twice
      over, imprint the picture still more deeply on their memories. He could
      guess, too, the stolen kiss snatched as they separated from each other&rsquo;s
      loved society. The luxury, the studied elegance, eloquent of the
      perfection of indolence, of ease; the extreme care shown, either to spare
      the loved object every annoyance, or to occasion her a delightful
      surprise; that might and majesty of love multiplied by the majesty and
      might of royalty itself, seemed like a death-blow to Raoul. If there be
      anything which can in any way assuage or mitigate the tortures of
      jealousy, it is the inferiority of the man who is preferred to yourself;
      whilst, on the very contrary, if there be one anguish more bitter than
      another, a misery for which language lacks a word, it is the superiority
      of the man preferred to yourself, superior, perhaps, in youth, beauty,
      grace. It is in such moments as these that Heaven almost seems to have
      taken part against the disdained and rejected lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      One final pang was reserved for poor Raoul. Madame Henrietta lifted up a
      silk curtain, and behind the canvas he perceived La Valliere&rsquo;s portrait.
      Not only the portrait of La Valliere, but of La Valliere radiant with
      youth, beauty, and happiness, inhaling life and enjoyment at every pore,
      because at eighteen years of age love itself is life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise!&rdquo; murmured Bragelonne,&mdash;&ldquo;Louise! is it true, then? Oh, you
      have never loved me, for never have you looked at me in that manner.&rdquo; And
      he felt as if his heart were crushed within his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Henrietta looked at him, almost envious of his extreme grief,
      although she well knew there was nothing to envy in it, and that she
      herself was as passionately loved by De Guiche as Louise by Bragelonne.
      Raoul interpreted Madame Henrietta&rsquo;s look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, forgive me, forgive me, Madame; in your presence I know I ought to
      have greater self-control. But Heaven grant that you may never be struck
      by similar misery to that which crushes me at this moment, for you are but
      a woman, and would not be able to endure so terrible an affliction.
      Forgive me, I again entreat you, Madame; I am but a man without rank or
      position, while you belong to a race whose happiness knows no bounds,
      whose power acknowledges no limit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Bragelonne,&rdquo; replied Henrietta, &ldquo;a mind such as yours merits
      all the consideration and respect which a queen&rsquo;s heart even can bestow.
      Regard me as your friend, monsieur; and as such, indeed, I would not allow
      your whole life to be poisoned by perfidy, and covered with ridicule. It
      was I, indeed, who, with more courage than any of your pretended friends,&mdash;I
      except M. de Guiche,&mdash;was the cause of your return from London; it is
      I, also, who now give you the melancholy proofs, necessary, however, for
      your cure if you are a lover with courage in his heart, and not a weeping
      Amadis. Do not thank me; pity me, even, and do not serve the king less
      faithfully than you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul smiled bitterly. &ldquo;Ah! true, true; I was forgetting that; the king is
      my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your liberty, nay, your very life, is in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A steady, penetrating look informed Madame Henrietta that she was
      mistaken, and that her last argument was not a likely one to affect the
      young man. &ldquo;Take care, Monsieur de Bragelonne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for if you do
      not weigh well all your actions, you might throw into an extravagance of
      wrath a prince whose passions, once aroused, exceed the bounds of reason,
      and you would thereby involve your friends and family in the deepest
      distress; you must bend, you must submit, and you must cure yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Madame; I appreciate the advice your royal highness is good
      enough to give me, and I will endeavor to follow it; but one final word, I
      beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I be indiscreet in asking you the secret of this staircase, of
      this trap-door; a secret, which, it seems, you have discovered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more simple. For the purpose of exercising a surveillance over
      the young girls who are attached to my service, I have duplicate keys of
      their doors. It seemed very strange to me that M. de Saint-Aignan should
      change his apartments. It seemed very strange that the king should come to
      see M. de Saint-Aignan every day, and, finally, it seemed very strange
      that so many things should be done during your absence, that the very
      habits and customs of the court appeared changed. I do not wish to be
      trifled with by the king, nor to serve as a cloak for his love affairs;
      for after La Valliere, who weeps incessantly, he will take a fancy to
      Montalais, who is always laughing; and then to Tonnay-Charente, who does
      nothing but sing all day; to act such a part as that would be unworthy of
      me. I thrust aside the scruples which my friendship for you suggested. I
      discovered the secret. I have wounded your feelings, I know, and I again
      entreat you to pardon me; but I had a duty to fulfil. I have discharged
      it. You are now forewarned; the tempest will soon burst; protect yourself
      accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You naturally expect, however, that a result of some kind must follow,&rdquo;
       replied Bragelonne, with firmness; &ldquo;for you do not suppose I shall
      silently accept the shame thus thrust upon me, or the treachery which has
      been practiced against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take whatever steps in the matter you please, Monsieur Raoul,
      only do not betray the source whence you derived the truth. That is all I
      have to ask,&mdash;the only price I require for the service I have
      rendered you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing, Madame,&rdquo; said Bragelonne, with a bitter smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bribed the locksmith, in whom the lovers confided. You can just as well
      have done so as myself, can you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame. Your royal highness, however, has no other advice or caution
      to give me, except that of not betraying you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about, therefore, to beg your royal highness to allow me to remain
      here for one moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, Madame. It matters very little; for what I have to do can be done
      in your presence. I only ask one moment to write a line to some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dangerous, Monsieur de Bragelonne. Take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can possibly know that your royal highness has done me the honor
      to conduct me here. Besides, I shall sign the letter I am going to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as you please, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul drew out his tablet, and wrote rapidly on one of the leaves the
      following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MONSIEUR LE COMTE,&mdash;Do not be surprised to find this paper signed by
      me; the friend I shall very shortly send to call on you will have the
      honor to explain the object of my visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;VICOMTE RAOUL DE BRAGELONNE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rolled up the paper, slipped it into the lock of the door which
      communicated with the room set apart for the two lovers, and satisfied
      himself that the missive was so apparent that Saint-Aignan could not but
      see it as he entered; he rejoined the princess, who had already reached
      the top of the staircase. They then separated, Raoul pretending to thank
      her highness; Henrietta pitying, or seeming to pity, with all her heart,
      the wretched young man she had just condemned to such fearful torture.
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, as she saw him disappear, pale as death, and his eyes
      bursting with blood, &ldquo;if I had foreseen this, I would have hid the truth
      from that poor gentleman.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter LIV. Porthos&rsquo;s Plan of Action.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The great number of individuals we have introduced into this long story is
      the reason why each of them has been forced to appear only in turn,
      according to the exigencies of the recital. The result is, that our
      readers have had no opportunity of meeting our friend Porthos since his
      return from Fontainebleau. The honors which he had received from the king
      had not changed the easy, affectionate character of that excellent-hearted
      man; he may, perhaps, have held up his head a little higher than usual,
      and a majesty of demeanor, as it were, may have betrayed itself since the
      honor of dining at the king&rsquo;s table had been accorded him. His majesty&rsquo;s
      banqueting-room had produced a certain effect on Porthos. Le Seigneur de
      Bracieux et de Pierrefonds delighted to remember that, during that
      memorable dinner, the numerous array of servants, and the large number of
      officials in attendance on the guests, gave a certain tone and effect to
      the repast, and seemed, as it were, to furnish the room. Porthos undertook
      to confer upon Mouston a position of some kind or other, in order to
      establish a sort of hierarchy among his other domestics, and to create a
      military household, which was not unusual among the great captains of the
      age, since, in the preceding century, this luxury had been greatly
      encouraged by Messieurs de Treville, de Schomberg, de la Vieuville,
      without alluding to M. de Richelieu, M. de Conde, and de Bouillon-Turenne.
      And, therefore, why should not he, Porthos, the friend of the king, and of
      M. Fouquet, a baron, and engineer, etc., why should not he, indeed, enjoy
      all the delightful privileges which large possessions and unusual merit
      invariably confer? Somewhat neglected by Aramis, who, we know, was greatly
      occupied with M. Fouquet; neglected, also, on account of his being on
      duty, by D&rsquo;Artagnan; tired of Truchen and Planchet, Porthos was surprised
      to find himself dreaming, without precisely knowing why; but if any one
      had said to him, &ldquo;Do you want anything, Porthos?&rdquo; he would most certainly
      have replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; After one of those dinners, during which Porthos
      attempted to recall to his recollection all the details of the royal
      banquet, gently joyful, thanks to the excellence of the wines; gently
      melancholy, thanks to his ambitious ideas, Porthos was gradually falling
      off into a placid doze, when his servant entered to announce that M. de
      Bragelonne wished to speak to him. Porthos passed into an adjoining room,
      where he found his young friend in the disposition of mind we are already
      aware of. Raoul advanced towards Porthos, and shook him by the hand;
      Porthos, surprised at his seriousness of aspect, offered him a seat. &ldquo;Dear
      M. du Vallon,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;I have a service to ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could happen more fortunately, my young friend,&rdquo; replied Porthos;
      &ldquo;I have eight thousand livres sent me this morning from Pierrefonds; and
      if you want any money&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you; it is not money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse, then. I have always heard it said that that is the
      rarest service, but the easiest to render. The remark struck me; I like to
      cite remarks that strike me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your heart is as good as your mind is sound and true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are much too kind, I declare. You will dine here, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am not hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! not dine? What a dreadful country England is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too much so, indeed&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if such excellent fish and meat were not to be procured there, it
      would hardly be endurable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I came to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening. Only just allow me to take a little sip. One gets thirsty
      in Paris;&rdquo; and he ordered a bottle of champagne to be brought; and, having
      first filled Raoul&rsquo;s glass, he filled his own, drank it down at a gulp,
      and then resumed: &ldquo;I needed that, in order to listen to you with proper
      attention. I am now entirely at your service. What do you wish to ask me,
      dear Raoul? What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your opinion on quarrels in general, my dear friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion! Well&mdash;but&mdash;Explain your idea a little more
      coherently,&rdquo; replied Porthos, rubbing his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;you are generally good-humored, good-tempered, whenever any
      misunderstanding arises between a friend of yours and a stranger, for
      instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! in the best of tempers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; but what do you do, in such a case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever any friend of mine gets into a quarrel, I always act on one
      principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lost time is irreparable, and one never arranges an affair so well
      as when everything has been done to embroil the disputants as much as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! indeed, is that the principle on which you proceed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; so, as soon as a quarrel takes place, I bring the two parties
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand that by this means it is impossible for an affair not to
      be arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought that, treated in this manner, an affair would, on
      the contrary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not the least in the world. Just fancy, now, I have had in my life
      something like a hundred and eighty to a hundred and ninety regular duels,
      without reckoning hasty encounters, or chance meetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very handsome aggregate,&rdquo; said Raoul, unable to resist a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere nothing; but I am so gentle. D&rsquo;Artagnan reckons his duels by
      hundreds. It is very true he is a little too hard and sharp&mdash;I have
      often told him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; resumed Raoul, &ldquo;you generally arrange the affairs of honor your
      friends confide to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a single instance in which I have not finished by arranging
      every one of them,&rdquo; said Porthos, with a gentleness and confidence that
      surprised Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the way in which you settle them is at least honorable, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! rely upon that; and at this stage, I will explain my other principle
      to you. As soon as my friend has intrusted his quarrel to me, this is what
      I do; I go to his adversary at once, armed with a politeness and
      self-possession absolutely requisite under such circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the way, then,&rdquo; said Raoul, bitterly, &ldquo;that you arrange affairs
      so safely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you. I go to the adversary, then, and say to him: &lsquo;It is
      impossible, monsieur, that you are ignorant of the extent to which you
      have insulted my friend.&rsquo;&rdquo; Raoul frowned at this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sometimes happens&mdash;very often, indeed,&rdquo; pursued Porthos&mdash;&ldquo;that
      my friend has not been insulted at all; he has even been the first to give
      offense; you can imagine, therefore, whether my language is or is not well
      chosen.&rdquo; And Porthos burst into a peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; said Raoul to himself while the merry thunder of Porthos&rsquo;s
      laughter was resounding in his ears, &ldquo;I am very unfortunate. De Guiche
      treats me with coolness, D&rsquo;Artagnan with ridicule, Porthos is too tame; no
      one will settle this affair in the only way I wish it to be settled. And I
      came to Porthos because I wanted to find a sword instead of cold reasoning
      at my service. My ill-luck dogs me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, who had recovered himself, continued: &ldquo;By one simple expression,
      I leave my adversary without an excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as it may happen,&rdquo; said Raoul, absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, it is quite certain. I have not left him an excuse; and then
      it is that I display all my courtesy, in order to attain the happy issue
      of my project. I advance, therefore, with an air of great politeness, and
      taking my adversary by the hand, I say to him: &lsquo;Now that you are convinced
      of having given the offense, we are sure of reparation; between my friend
      and yourself, the future can only offer an exchange of mutual courtesies
      of conduct, and consequently, my mission now is to acquaint you with the
      length of my friend&rsquo;s sword.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute. &lsquo;The length of my friend&rsquo;s sword. My horse is waiting
      below; my friend is in such and such a spot and is impatiently awaiting
      your agreeable society; I will take you with me; we can call upon your
      second as we go along:&rsquo; and the affair is arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Raoul, pale with vexation, &ldquo;you reconcile the two
      adversaries on the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; interrupted Porthos. &ldquo;Reconcile! What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said that the affair was arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! since my friend is waiting for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what then? If he is waiting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! if he is waiting, it is merely to stretch his legs a little. The
      adversary, on the contrary, is stiff from riding; they place themselves in
      proper order, and my friend kills the opponent, and the affair is ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he kills him, then?&rdquo; cried Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said Porthos. &ldquo;Is it likely I should ever have as a
      friend a man who allows himself to get killed? I have a hundred and one
      friends; at the head of the list stand your father, Aramis, and
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, all of whom are living and well, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear baron,&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, as he embraced Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You approve of my method, then?&rdquo; said the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I approve of it so thoroughly, that I shall have recourse to it this very
      day, without a moment&rsquo;s delay,&mdash;at once, in fact. You are the very
      man I have been looking for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; here I am, then; you want to fight, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very natural. With whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With M. de Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him&mdash;a most agreeable man, who was exceedingly polite to me
      the day I had the honor of dining with the king. I shall certainly
      acknowledge his politeness in return, even if it had not happened to be my
      usual custom. So, he has given you an offense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mortal offense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! I can say so, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than that, even, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very great convenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may look upon it as one of your arranged affairs, may I not?&rdquo; said
      Raoul, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of course. Where will you be waiting for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I forgot; it is a very delicate matter. M. de Saint-Aignan is a very
      great friend of the king&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have heard it said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that if I kill him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you will kill him, certainly; you must take every precaution to do
      so. But there is no difficulty in these matters now; if you had lived in
      our early days,&mdash;ah, those were days worth living for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, you do not quite understand me. I mean, that M. de
      Saint-Aignan being a friend of the king, the affair will be more difficult
      to manage, since the king might learn beforehand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no; that is not likely. You know my method: &lsquo;Monsieur, you have just
      injured my friend, and&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then: &lsquo;Monsieur, I have horses below.&rsquo; I carry him off before he can
      have spoken to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he allow himself to be carried off like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so! I should like to see it fail. It would be the first
      time, if it did. It is true, though, that the young men of the present day&mdash;Bah!
      I would carry him off bodily, if that were all,&rdquo; and Porthos, adding
      gesture to speech, lifted Raoul and the chair he was sitting on off the
      ground, and carried them round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Raoul, laughing. &ldquo;All we have to do is to state the
      grounds of the quarrel with M. de Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but that is done, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear M. du Vallon, the usage of the present day requires that the
      cause of the quarrel should be explained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Tell me what it is, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deuce take it! how troublesome all this is! In former days we had no
      occasion to say anything about the matter. People fought for the sake of
      fighting; and I, for one, know no better reason than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, M. du Vallon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, tell me what the cause is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too long a story to tell; only, as one must particularize to a
      certain extent, and as, on the other hand, the affair is full of
      difficulties, and requires the most absolute secrecy, you will have the
      kindness merely to tell M. de Saint-Aignan that he has, in the first
      place, insulted me by changing his lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By changing his lodgings? Good,&rdquo; said Porthos, who began to count on his
      fingers; &ldquo;next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then in getting a trap-door made in his new apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;a trap-door: upon my word, that is very
      serious; you ought to be furious at that. What the deuce does the fellow
      mean by getting trap-doors made without first consulting you? Trap-doors!
      <i>mordioux!</i> I haven&rsquo;t got any, except in my dungeons at Bracieux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will please add,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;that my last motive for
      considering myself insulted is, the existence of the portrait that M. de
      Saint-Aignan well knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible? A portrait, too! A change of residence, a trap-door, and
      a portrait! Why, my dear friend, with but one of these causes of complaint
      there is enough, and more than enough, for all the gentlemen in France and
      Spain to cut each other&rsquo;s throats, and that is saying but very little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear friend, you are furnished with all you need, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take a second horse with me. Select your own rendezvous, and
      while you are waiting there, you can practice some of the best passes, so
      as to get your limbs as elastic as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I shall be waiting for you in the wood of Vincennes, close to
      Minimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All goes well, then. Where am I to find this M. de Saint-Aignan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Palais Royal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos ran a huge hand-bell. &ldquo;My court suit,&rdquo; he said to the servant who
      answered the summons, &ldquo;my horse, and a led horse to accompany me.&rdquo; Then
      turning to Raoul, as soon as the servant had quitted the room, he said:
      &ldquo;Does your father know anything about this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am going to write to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor D&rsquo;Artagnan either. He is very cautious, you know, and might have
      diverted me from my purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan is a sound adviser, though,&rdquo; said Porthos, astonished that, in
      his own loyal faith in D&rsquo;Artagnan, any one could have thought of himself,
      so long as there was a D&rsquo;Artagnan in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear M. du Vallon,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;do not question me any more, I implore
      you. I have told you all that I had to say; it is prompt action I now
      expect, sharp and decided as you know how to arrange it. That, indeed, is
      my reason for having chosen you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be satisfied with me,&rdquo; replied Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget, either, that, except ourselves, no one must know anything
      of this meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People generally find these things out,&rdquo; said Porthos, dryly, &ldquo;when a
      dead body is discovered in a wood. But I promise everything, my dear
      friend, except the concealment of the dead body. There it is, and it must
      be seen, as a matter of course. It is a principle of mine, not to bury
      bodies. That has a smack of the assassin about it. Every risk has its
      peculiarities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To work, then, my dear friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rely upon me,&rdquo; said the giant, finishing the bottle, while a servant
      spread out upon a sofa the gorgeously decorated dress trimmed with lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul left the room, saying to himself, with a secret delight, &ldquo;Perfidious
      king! traitorous monarch! I cannot reach thee. I do not wish it; for kings
      are sacred objects. But your friend, your accomplice, your panderer&mdash;the
      coward who represents you&mdash;shall pay for your crime. I will kill him
      in thy name, and, afterwards, we will bethink ourselves of&mdash;<i>Louise</i>.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter LV. The Change of Residence, the Trap-Door, and the Portrait.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Porthos, intrusted, to his great delight, with this mission, which made
      him feel young again, took half an hour less than his usual time to put on
      his court suit. To show that he was a man acquainted with the usages of
      high society, he had begun by sending his lackey to inquire if Monsieur de
      Saint-Aignan were at home, and heard, in answer, that M. le Comte de
      Saint-Aignan had had the honor of accompanying the king to Saint-Germain,
      as well as the whole court; but that monsieur le comte had just that
      moment returned. Immediately upon this reply, Porthos made as much haste
      as possible, and reached Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s apartments just as the latter was
      having his boots taken off. The promenade had been delightful. The king,
      who was in love more than ever, and of course happier than ever, behaved
      in the most charming manner to every one. Nothing could possibly equal his
      kindness. M. de Saint-Aignan, it may be remembered, was a poet, and
      fancied that he had proved that he was so under too many a memorable
      circumstance to allow the title to be disputed by any one. An
      indefatigable rhymester, he had, during the whole of the journey,
      overwhelmed with quatrains, sextains, and madrigals, first the king, and
      then La Valliere. The king, on his side, was in a similarly poetical mood,
      and had made a distich; while La Valliere, delighting in poetry, as most
      women do who are in love, had composed two sonnets. The day, then, had not
      been a bad one for Apollo; and so, as soon as he had returned to Paris,
      Saint-Aignan, who knew beforehand that his verse would be sure to be
      extensively circulated in court circles, occupied himself, with a little
      more attention than he had been able to bestow during the promenade, with
      the composition, as well as with the idea itself. Consequently, with all
      the tenderness of a father about to start his children in life, he
      candidly interrogated himself whether the public would find these
      offsprings of his imagination sufficiently elegant and graceful; and in
      order to make his mind easy on the subject, M. de Saint-Aignan recited to
      himself the madrigal he had composed, and which he had repeated from
      memory to the king, and had promised to write out for him on his return.
      All the time he was committing these words to memory, the comte was
      engaged in undressing himself more completely. He had just taken off his
      coat, and was putting on his dressing-gown, when he was informed that
      Monsieur le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds was waiting to be
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what does that bunch of names mean? I don&rsquo;t know anything
      about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same gentleman,&rdquo; replied the lackey, &ldquo;who had the honor of
      dining with you, monseigneur, at the king&rsquo;s table, when his majesty was
      staying at Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Introduce him, then, at once,&rdquo; cried Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, in a few minutes, entered the room. M. de Saint-Aignan had an
      excellent recollection of persons, and, at the first glance, he recognized
      the gentleman from the country, who enjoyed so singular a reputation, and
      whom the king had received so favorably at Fontainebleau, in spite of the
      smiles of some of those who were present. He therefore advanced towards
      Porthos with all the outward signs of consideration of manner which
      Porthos thought but natural, considering that he himself, whenever he
      called upon an adversary, hoisted a standard of the most refined
      politeness. Saint-Aignan desired the servant to give Porthos a chair; and
      the latter, who saw nothing unusual in this act of politeness, sat down
      gravely and coughed. The ordinary courtesies having been exchanged between
      the two gentlemen, the comte, to whom the visit was paid, said, &ldquo;May I
      ask, monsieur le baron, to what happy circumstance I am indebted for the
      favor of a visit from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very thing I am about to have the honor of explaining to you,
      monsieur le comte; but, I beg your pardon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, monsieur?&rdquo; inquired Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say that I have broken your chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, monsieur,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan; &ldquo;not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the fact, though, monsieur le comte; I have broken it&mdash;so much
      so, indeed, that if I do not move, I shall fall down, which would be an
      exceedingly disagreeable position for me in the discharge of the very
      serious mission which has been intrusted to me with regard to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos rose; and but just in time, for the chair had given way several
      inches. Saint-Aignan looked about him for something more solid for his
      guest to sit upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modern articles of furniture,&rdquo; said Porthos, while the comte was looking
      about, &ldquo;are constructed in a ridiculously flimsy manner. In my early days,
      when I used to sit down with far more energy than is now the case, I do
      not remember ever to have broken a chair, except in taverns, with my
      arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan smiled at this remark. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Porthos, as he settled
      himself down on a couch, which creaked, but did not give way beneath his
      weight, &ldquo;that unfortunately has nothing whatever to do with my present
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why unfortunately? Are you the bearer of a message of ill-omen, monsieur
      le baron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of ill-omen&mdash;for a gentleman? Certainly not, monsieur le comte,&rdquo;
       replied Porthos, nobly. &ldquo;I have simply come to say that you have seriously
      insulted a friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, monsieur?&rdquo; exclaimed Saint-Aignan&mdash;&ldquo;I have insulted a friend of
      yours, do you say? May I ask his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Raoul de Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have insulted M. Raoul de Bragelonne!&rdquo; cried Saint-Aignan. &ldquo;I really
      assure you, monsieur, that it is quite impossible; for M. de Bragelonne,
      whom I know but very slightly,&mdash;nay, whom I know hardly at all&mdash;is
      in England, and, as I have not seen him for a long time past, I cannot
      possibly have insulted him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Bragelonne is in Paris, monsieur le comte,&rdquo; said Porthos, perfectly
      unmoved; &ldquo;and I repeat, it is quite certain you have insulted him, since
      he himself told me you had. Yes, monsieur, you have seriously insulted
      him, mortally insulted him, I repeat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible, monsieur le baron, I swear, quite impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Porthos, &ldquo;you cannot be ignorant of the circumstance,
      since M. de Bragelonne informed me that he had already apprised you of it
      by a note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word of honor, monsieur, that I have received no note
      whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most extraordinary,&rdquo; replied Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will convince you,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;that have received nothing in
      any way from him.&rdquo; And he rang the bell. &ldquo;Basque,&rdquo; he said to the servant
      who entered, &ldquo;how many letters or notes were sent here during my absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three, monsieur le comte&mdash;a note from M. de Fiesque, one from Madame
      de Laferte, and a letter from M. de las Fuentes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur le comte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak the truth before this gentleman&mdash;the truth, you understand. I
      will take care you are not blamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a note, also, from&mdash;from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, from whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Mademoiselle&mdash;de&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Laval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite sufficient,&rdquo; interrupted Porthos. &ldquo;I believe you, monsieur
      le comte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan dismissed the valet, and followed him to the door, in order
      to close it after him; and when he had done so, looking straight before
      him, he happened to see in the keyhole of the adjoining apartment the
      paper which Bragelonne had slipped in there as he left. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, who was sitting with his back to the room, turned round. &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A note in the keyhole!&rdquo; exclaimed Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not unlikely to be the missing letter, monsieur le comte,&rdquo; said
      Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan took out the paper. &ldquo;A note from M. de Bragelonne!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, monsieur, I was right. Oh, when I say a thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought here by M. de Bragelonne himself,&rdquo; the comte murmured, turning
      pale. &ldquo;This is infamous! How could he possibly have come here?&rdquo; And the
      comte rang again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has been here during my absence with the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible! Some one must have been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one could possibly have entered, monsieur, since the keys have never
      left my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I find the letter in yonder lock; some one must have put it
      there; it could not have come here of its own accord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Basque opened his arms as if signifying the most absolute ignorance on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably it was M. de Bragelonne himself who placed it there,&rdquo; said
      Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case he must have entered here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could that have been, since I have the key in my own pocket?&rdquo;
       returned Basque, perseveringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan crumpled the letter in his palm, after having read it. &ldquo;There
      is something mysterious about this,&rdquo; he murmured, absorbed in thought.
      Porthos left him to his reflections; but after a while returned to the
      mission he had undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we return to our little affair?&rdquo; Porthos resumed, addressing
      Saint-Aignan after a brief pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can now understand it, from this note, which has arrived here
      in so singular a manner. Monsieur de Bragelonne says that a friend will
      call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his friend. I am the person he alludes to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the purpose of giving me a challenge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he complains that I have insulted him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way, may I ask; for his conduct is so mysterious, that, at least,
      it needs some explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Porthos, &ldquo;my friend cannot but be right; and, as far
      as his conduct is concerned, if it be mysterious, as you say, you have
      only yourself to blame for it.&rdquo; Porthos pronounced these words with an
      amount of confidence which, for a man who was unaccustomed to his ways,
      must have revealed an infinity of sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mystery, so be it; but what is all the mystery about?&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think it the best, perhaps,&rdquo; Porthos replied, with a low bow,
      &ldquo;if I do not enter in to particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I perfectly understand. We will touch very lightly upon it, then, so
      speak, monsieur, I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, monsieur,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;you have changed your
      apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is quite true,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit it,&rdquo; said Porthos, with an air of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit it! of course I admit it. Why should I not admit it, do you
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have admitted it. Very good,&rdquo; said Porthos, lifting up one finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can my having moved my lodgings have done M. de Bragelonne any
      harm? Have the goodness to tell me that, for I positively do not
      comprehend a word of what you are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos stopped him, and then said, with great gravity, &ldquo;Monsieur, this is
      the first of M. de Bragelonne&rsquo;s complaints against you. If he makes a
      complaint, it is because he feels himself insulted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan began to beat his foot impatiently on the ground. &ldquo;This looks
      like a spurious quarrel,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can possibly have a spurious quarrel with the Vicomte de
      Bragelonne,&rdquo; returned Porthos; &ldquo;but, at all events, you have nothing to
      add on the subject of your changing your apartments, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. And what is the next point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the next! You will observe, monsieur, that the one I have already
      mentioned is a most serious injury, to which you have given no answer, or
      rather, have answered very indifferently. Is it possible, monsieur, that
      you have changed your lodgings? M. de Bragelonne feels insulted at your
      having done so, and you do not attempt to excuse yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Saint-Aignan, who was getting annoyed at the perfect
      coolness of his visitor&mdash;&ldquo;what! am I to consult M. de Bragelonne
      whether I am to move or not? You can hardly be serious, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. And it is absolutely necessary, monsieur; but under any
      circumstances, you will admit that it is nothing in comparison with the
      second ground of complaint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos assumed a very solemn expression as he said: &ldquo;How about the
      trap-door, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan turned exceedingly pale. He pushed back his chair so
      abruptly, that Porthos, simple as he was, perceived that the blow had
      told. &ldquo;The trap-door,&rdquo; murmured Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, explain that if you can,&rdquo; said Porthos, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan held down his head, as he murmured: &ldquo;I have been betrayed,
      everything is known!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; replied Porthos, who knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see me perfectly overwhelmed,&rdquo; pursued Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;overwhelmed to
      a degree that I hardly know what I am about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A guilty conscience, monsieur. Your affair is a bad one, and when the
      public learns all about it, it will judge&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur!&rdquo; exclaimed the count, hurriedly, &ldquo;such a secret ought not
      to be known even by one&rsquo;s confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we will think about,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;the secret will not go far, in
      fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, monsieur,&rdquo; returned Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;since M. de Bragelonne has
      penetrated the secret, he must be aware of the danger he as well as others
      run the risk of incurring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Bragelonne runs no danger, monsieur, nor does he fear any either,
      as you, if it please Heaven, will find out very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fellow is a perfect madman,&rdquo; thought Saint-Aignan. &ldquo;What, in
      Heaven&rsquo;s name, does he want?&rdquo; He then said aloud: &ldquo;Come, monsieur, let us
      hush up this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget the portrait,&rdquo; said Porthos, in a voice of thunder, which made
      the comte&rsquo;s blood freeze in his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the portrait in question was La Valliere&rsquo;s portrait, and no mistake
      could any longer exist on the subject, Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s eyes were completely
      opened. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;ah! monsieur, I remember now that M. de
      Bragelonne was engaged to be married to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos assumed an imposing air, all the majesty of ignorance, in fact, as
      he said: &ldquo;It matters nothing whatever to me, nor to yourself, indeed,
      whether or not my friend was, as you say, engaged to be married. I am even
      astonished that you should have made use of so indiscreet a remark. It may
      possibly do your cause harm, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;you are the incarnation of
      intelligence, delicacy, and loyalty of feeling united. I see the whole
      matter now clearly enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; pursued Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;you have made me comprehend it in the most
      ingenious and the most delicate manner possible. I beg you to accept my
      best thanks.&rdquo; Porthos drew himself up, unable to resist the flattery of
      the remark. &ldquo;Only, now that I know everything, permit me to explain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos shook his head, as a man who does not wish to hear, but
      Saint-Aignan continued: &ldquo;I am in despair, I assure you, at all that has
      happened; but how would you have acted in my place? Come, between
      ourselves, tell me what you would have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos drew himself up as he answered: &ldquo;There is now no question at all
      of what I should have done, young man; you have been made acquainted with
      the three causes of complaint against you, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the first, my change of rooms, and I now address myself to you as
      a man of honor and of great intelligence, could I, when the desire of so
      august a personage was so urgently expressed that I should move, ought I
      to have disobeyed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos was about to speak, but Saint-Aignan did not give him time to
      answer. &ldquo;Ah! my frankness, I see, convinces you,&rdquo; he said, interpreting
      the movement according to his own fancy. &ldquo;You feel that I am right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos did not reply, and so Saint-Aignan continued: &ldquo;I pass by that
      unfortunate trap-door,&rdquo; he said, placing his hand on Porthos&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;that
      trap-door, the occasion and means of so much unhappiness, and which was
      constructed for&mdash;you know what. Well, then, in plain truth, do you
      suppose that it was I who, of my own accord, in such a place, too, had
      that trap-door made?&mdash;Oh, no!&mdash;you do not believe it; and here,
      again, you feel, you guess, you understand the influence of a will
      superior to my own. You can conceive the infatuation, the blind,
      irresistible passion which has been at work. But, thank Heaven! I am
      fortunate in speaking to a man who has so much sensitiveness of feeling;
      and if it were not so, indeed, what an amount of misery and scandal would
      fall upon her, poor girl! and upon him&mdash;whom I will not name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, confused and bewildered by the eloquence and gestures of
      Saint-Aignan, made a thousand efforts to stem this torrent of words, of
      which, by the by, he did not understand a single one; he remained upright
      and motionless on his seat, and that was all he could do. Saint-Aignan
      continued, and gave a new inflection to his voice, and an increasing
      vehemence to his gesture: &ldquo;As for the portrait, for I readily believe the
      portrait is the principal cause of complaint, tell me candidly if you
      think me to blame?&mdash;Who was it who wished to have her portrait? Was
      it I?&mdash;Who is in love with her? Is it I?&mdash;Who wishes to gain her
      affection? Again, is it I?&mdash;Who took her likeness? I, do you think?
      No! a thousand times no! I know M. de Bragelonne must be in a state of
      despair; I know these misfortunes are most cruel. But I, too, am suffering
      as well; and yet there is no possibility of offering any resistance.
      Suppose we were to fight? we would be laughed at. If he obstinately
      persist in his course, he is lost. You will tell me, I know, that despair
      is ridiculous, but then you are a sensible man. You have understood me. I
      perceived by your serious, thoughtful, embarrassed air, even, that the
      importance of the situation we are placed in has not escaped you. Return,
      therefore, to M. de Bragelonne; thank him&mdash;as I have indeed reason to
      thank him&mdash;for having chosen as an intermediary a man of your high
      merit. Believe me that I shall, on my side, preserve an eternal gratitude
      for the man who has so ingeniously, so cleverly arranged the
      misunderstanding between us. And since ill luck would have it that the
      secret should be known to four instead of three, why, this secret, which
      might make the most ambitious man&rsquo;s fortune, I am delighted to share with
      you, monsieur, from the bottom of my heart I am delighted at it. From this
      very moment you can make use of me as you please, I place myself entirely
      at your mercy. What can I possibly do for you? What can I solicit, nay,
      require even? You have only to speak, monsieur, only to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, according to the familiarly friendly fashion of that period,
      Saint-Aignan threw his arms round Porthos, and clasped him tenderly in his
      embrace. Porthos allowed him to do this with the most perfect
      indifference. &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; resumed Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;what do you require?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Porthos, &ldquo;I have a horse below: be good enough to mount
      him; he is a very good one and will play you no tricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount on horseback! what for?&rdquo; inquired Saint-Aignan, with no little
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To accompany me to where M. de Bragelonne is waiting us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he wishes to speak to me, I suppose? I can well believe that; he
      wishes to have the details, very likely; alas! it is a very delicate
      matter; but at the present moment I cannot, for the king is waiting for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king must wait, then,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say? the king must wait!&rdquo; interrupted the finished courtier,
      with a smile of utter amazement, for he could not understand that the king
      could under any circumstances be supposed to have to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is merely the affair of a very short hour,&rdquo; returned Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is M. de Bragelonne waiting for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Minimes, at Vincennes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed! but are we going to laugh over the affair when we get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it likely,&rdquo; said Porthos, as his face assumed a look of
      utter hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Minimes is a rendezvous where duels take place, and what can I
      have to do at the Minimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos slowly drew his sword, and said: &ldquo;That is the length of my
      friend&rsquo;s sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the man is mad!&rdquo; cried Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color mounted to Porthos&rsquo;s face, as he replied: &ldquo;If I had not the
      honor of being in your own apartment, monsieur, and of representing M. de
      Bragelonne&rsquo;s interests, I would throw you out of the window. It will be
      merely a pleasure postponed, and you will lose nothing by waiting. Will
      you come with me to the Minimes, monsieur, of your own free will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, I will carry you if you do not come quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Basque!&rdquo; cried Saint-Aignan. As soon as Basque appeared, he said, &ldquo;The
      king wishes to see monsieur le comte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very different,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s service before
      anything else. We will wait until this evening, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And saluting Saint-Aignan with his usual courtesy, Porthos left the room,
      delighted at having arranged another affair. Saint-Aignan looked after him
      as he left; and then hastily putting on his court dress again, he ran off,
      arranging his costume as he went along, muttering to himself, &ldquo;The
      Minimes! the Minimes! We shall see how the king will fancy this challenge;
      for it is for him after all, that is certain.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter LVI. Rivals in Politics.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On his return from the promenade, which had been so prolific in poetical
      effusions, and in which every one had paid his or her tribute to the
      Muses, as the poets of the period used to say, the king found M. Fouquet
      waiting for an audience. M. Colbert had lain in wait for his majesty in
      the corridor, and followed him like a jealous and watchful shadow; M.
      Colbert, with his square head, his vulgar and untidy, though rich costume,
      somewhat resembled a Flemish gentleman after he had been over-indulging in
      his national drink&mdash;beer. Fouquet, at sight of his enemy, remained
      perfectly unmoved, and during the whole of the scene which followed
      scrupulously resolved to observe a line of conduct particularly difficult
      to the man of superior mind, who does not even wish to show his contempt,
      for fear of doing his adversary too much honor. Colbert made no attempt to
      conceal his insolent expression of the vulgar joy he felt. In his opinion,
      M. Fouquet&rsquo;s was a game very badly played and hopelessly lost, although
      not yet finished. Colbert belonged to that school of politicians who think
      cleverness alone worthy of their admiration, and success the only thing
      worth caring for. Colbert, moreover, who was not simply an envious and
      jealous man, but who had the king&rsquo;s interest really at heart, because he
      was thoroughly imbued with the highest sense of probity in all matters of
      figures and accounts, could well afford to assign as a pretext for his
      conduct, that in hating and doing his utmost to ruin M. Fouquet, he had
      nothing in view but the welfare of the state and the dignity of the crown.
      None of these details escaped Fouquet&rsquo;s observation; through his enemy&rsquo;s
      thick, bushy brows, and despite the restless movement of his eyelids, he
      could, by merely looking at his eyes, penetrate to the very bottom of
      Colbert&rsquo;s heart, and he read to what an unbounded extent hate towards
      himself and triumph at his approaching fall existed there. But as, in
      observing everything, he wished to remain himself impenetrable, he
      composed his features, smiled with the charmingly sympathetic smile that
      was peculiarly his own, and saluted the king with the most dignified and
      graceful ease and elasticity of manner. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I perceive by
      your majesty&rsquo;s joyous air that you have been gratified with the
      promenade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most gratified, indeed, monsieur le surintendant, most gratified. You
      were very wrong not to come with us, as I invited you to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was working, sire,&rdquo; replied the superintendent, who did not even seem
      to take the trouble to turn aside his head in merest respect of Colbert&rsquo;s
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! M. Fouquet,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;there is nothing like the country. I
      should be delighted to live in the country always, in the open air and
      under the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope that your majesty is not yet weary of the throne,&rdquo; said
      Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but thrones of soft turf are very pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty gratifies my utmost wishes in speaking in that manner, for I
      have a request to submit to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On whose behalf, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh behalf of the nymphs of Vaux, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; said Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, too, once deigned to make me a promise,&rdquo; said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>fete</i> at Vaux, the celebrated <i>fete</i>, I think, it was,
      sire,&rdquo; said Colbert, endeavoring to show his importance by taking part in
      the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet, with the profoundest contempt, did not take the slightest notice
      of the remark, as if, as far as he was concerned, Colbert had not even
      thought or said a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is aware,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I destine my estate at Vaux to
      receive the most amiable of princes, the most powerful of monarchs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given you my promise, monsieur,&rdquo; said Louis XIV., smiling; &ldquo;and a
      king never departs from his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have come now, sire, to inform your majesty that I am ready to obey
      your orders in every respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you promise me many wonders, monsieur le surintendant?&rdquo; said Louis,
      looking at Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonders? Oh! no, sire. I do not undertake that. I hope to be able to
      procure your majesty a little pleasure, perhaps even a little
      forgetfulness of the cares of state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, M. Fouquet,&rdquo; returned the king; &ldquo;I insist upon the word
      &lsquo;wonders.&rsquo; You are a magician, I believe; we all know the power you wield;
      we also know that you can find gold even when there is none to be found
      elsewhere; so much so, indeed, that people say you coin it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet felt that the shot was discharged from a double quiver, and that
      the king had launched an arrow from his own bow as well as one from
      Colbert&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, laughingly, &ldquo;the people know perfectly well out
      of what mine I procure the gold; and they know it only too well, perhaps;
      besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I can assure your majesty that the gold destined to
      pay the expenses of the <i>fete</i> at Vaux will cost neither blood nor
      tears; hard labor it may, perhaps, but that can be paid for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis paused quite confused. He wished to look at Colbert; Colbert, too,
      wished to reply to him; a glance as swift as an eagle&rsquo;s, a king-like
      glance, indeed, which Fouquet darted at the latter, arrested the words
      upon his lips. The king, who had by this time recovered his
      self-possession, turned towards Fouquet, saying, &ldquo;I presume, therefore, I
      am now to consider myself formally invited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, if your majesty will condescend so far as to accept my
      invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What day have you fixed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any day your majesty may find most convenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak like an enchanter who has but to conjure up in actuality the
      wildest fancies, Monsieur Fouquet. I could not say so much, indeed,
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty will do, whenever you please, everything that a monarch can
      and ought to do. The king of France has servants at his bidding who are
      able to do anything on his behalf, to accomplish everything to gratify his
      pleasures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert tried to look at the superintendent, in order to see whether this
      remark was an approach to less hostile sentiments on his part; but Fouquet
      had not even looked at his enemy, and Colbert hardly seemed to exist as
      far as he was concerned. &ldquo;Very good, then,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Will a week
      hence suit you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly well, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Tuesday; if I give you until next Sunday week, will that be
      sufficient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The delay which your majesty deigns to accord me will greatly aid the
      various works which my architects have in hand for the purpose of adding
      to the amusement of your majesty and your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by, speaking of my friends,&rdquo; resumed the king; &ldquo;how do you intend
      to treat them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is master everywhere, sire; your majesty will draw up your own
      list and give your own orders. All those you may deign to invite will be
      my guests, my honored guests, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you!&rdquo; returned the king, touched by the noble thought expressed
      in so noble a tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet, therefore, took leave of Louis XIV., after a few words had been
      added with regard to the details of certain matters of business. He felt
      that Colbert would remain behind with the king, that they would both
      converse about him, and that neither of them would spare him in the least
      degree. The satisfaction of being able to give a last and terrible blow to
      his enemy seemed to him almost like a compensation for everything they
      were about to subject him to. He turned back again immediately, as soon,
      indeed, as he had reached the door, and addressing the king, said, &ldquo;I was
      forgetting that I had to crave your majesty&rsquo;s forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what respect?&rdquo; said the king, graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For having committed a serious fault without perceiving it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fault! You! Ah! Monsieur Fouquet, I shall be unable to do otherwise
      than forgive you. In what way or against whom have you been found
      wanting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against every sense of propriety, sire. I forgot to inform your majesty
      of a circumstance that has lately occurred of some little importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert trembled; he fancied that he was about to frame a denunciation
      against him. His conduct had been unmasked. A single syllable from
      Fouquet, a single proof formally advanced, and before the youthful loyalty
      of feeling which guided Louis XIV., Colbert&rsquo;s favor would disappear at
      once; the latter trembled, therefore, lest so daring a blow might
      overthrow his whole scaffold; in point of fact, the opportunity was so
      admirably suited to be taken advantage of, that a skillful, practiced
      player like Aramis would not have let it slip. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Fouquet, with
      an easy, unconcerned air, &ldquo;since you have had the kindness to forgive me,
      I am perfectly indifferent about my confession; this morning I sold one of
      the official appointments I hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your appointments,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colbert turned perfectly livid. &ldquo;That which conferred upon me, sire, a
      grand gown, and a stern air of gravity; the appointment of
      procureur-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king involuntarily uttered a loud exclamation and looked at Colbert,
      who, with his face bedewed with perspiration, felt almost on the point of
      fainting. &ldquo;To whom have you sold this department, Monsieur Fouquet?&rdquo;
       inquired the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colbert was obliged to lean against a column of the fireplace. &ldquo;To a
      councilor belonging to the parliament, sire, whose name is Vanel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, a particular friend of the intendant Colbert,&rdquo; added Fouquet;
      letting every word fall from his lips with the most inimitable
      nonchalance, and with an admirably assumed expression of forgetfulness and
      ignorance. And having finished, and having overwhelmed Colbert beneath the
      weight of this superiority, the superintendent again saluted the king and
      quitted the room, partially revenged by the stupefaction of the king and
      the humiliation of the favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really possible,&rdquo; said the king, as soon as Fouquet had
      disappeared, &ldquo;that he has sold that office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; said Colbert, meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be mad,&rdquo; the king added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colbert this time did not reply; he had penetrated the king&rsquo;s thought, a
      thought which amply revenged him for the humiliation he had just been made
      to suffer; his hatred was augmented by a feeling of bitter jealousy of
      Fouquet; and a threat of disgrace was now added to the plan he had
      arranged for his ruin. Colbert felt perfectly assured that for the future,
      between Louis XIV. and himself, their hostile feelings and ideas would
      meet with no obstacles, and that at the first fault committed by Fouquet,
      which could be laid hold of as a pretext, the chastisement so long
      impending would be precipitated. Fouquet had thrown aside his weapons of
      defense, and hate and jealousy had picked them up. Colbert was invited by
      the king to the <i>fete</i> at Vaux; he bowed like a man confident in
      himself, and accepted the invitation with the air of one who almost
      confers a favor. The king was about writing down Saint-Aignan&rsquo;s name on
      his list of royal commands, when the usher announced the Comte de
      Saint-Aignan. As soon as the royal &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; entered, Colbert discreetly
      withdrew.

    <h2>
      Chapter LVII. Rivals in Love.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan had quitted Louis XIV. hardly a couple of hours before; but
      in the first effervescence of his affection, whenever Louis XIV. was out
      of sight of La Valliere, he was obliged to talk about her. Besides, the
      only person with whom he could speak about her at his ease was
      Saint-Aignan, and thus Saint-Aignan had become an indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, is that you, comte?&rdquo; he exclaimed, as soon as he perceived him,
      doubly delighted, not only to see him again, but also to get rid of
      Colbert, whose scowling face always put him out of humor. &ldquo;So much the
      better, I am very glad to see you. You will make one of the best traveling
      party, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what traveling part are you speaking, sire?&rdquo; inquired Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one we are making up to go to the <i>fete</i> the superintendent is
      about to give at Vaux. Ah! Saint-Aignan, you will, at last, see a <i>fete</i>,
      a royal <i>fete</i>, by the side of which all our amusements at
      Fontainebleau are petty, contemptible affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Vaux! the superintendent going to give a <i>fete</i> in your majesty&rsquo;s
      honor? Nothing more than that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing more than that,&rsquo; do you say? It is very diverting to find you
      treating it with so much disdain. Are you who express such an indifference
      on the subject, aware, that as soon as it is known that M. Fouquet is
      going to receive me at Vaux next Sunday week, people will be striving
      their very utmost to get invited to the <i>fete?</i> I repeat,
      Saint-Aignan, you shall be one of the invited guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sire; unless I shall, in the meantime, have undertaken a
      longer and a less agreeable journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What journey do you allude to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one across the Styx, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Louis XIV., laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, seriously, sire,&rdquo; replied Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;I am invited; and in such a
      way, in truth, that I hardly know what to say, or how to act, in order to
      refuse the invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you. I know that you are in a poetical vein; but try
      not to sink from Apollo to Phoebus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; if your majesty will deign to listen to me, I will not keep
      your mind on the rack a moment longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty knows the Baron du Vallon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed; a good servant to my father, the late king, and an admirable
      companion at table; for, I think, you are referring to the gentleman who
      dined with us at Fontainebleau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely so; but you have omitted to add to his other qualifications,
      sire, that he is a most charming polisher-off of other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Does M. du Vallon wish to polish you off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to get me killed, which is much the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not laugh, sire, for I am not saying one word beyond the exact truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say he wishes to get you killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is that excellent person&rsquo;s present idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be easy; I will defend you, if he be in the wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! There is an &lsquo;if&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; answer me as candidly as if it were some one else&rsquo;s affair
      instead of your own, my poor Saint-Aignan; is he right or wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty shall be the judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To him, personally, nothing at all; but, it seems, to one of his friends,
      I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all the same. Is his friend one of the celebrated &lsquo;four&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is the son of one of the celebrated &lsquo;four,&rsquo; though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done to the son? Come, tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it seems that I have helped some one to take his mistress from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You confess it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help confessing it, for it is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, you are wrong; and if he were to kill you, he would be
      doing perfectly right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is your majesty&rsquo;s way of reasoning, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it a bad way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very expeditious way, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good justice is prompt;&rsquo; so my grandfather Henry IV. used to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, your majesty will, perhaps, be good enough to sign my
      adversary&rsquo;s pardon, for he is now waiting for me at the Minimes, for the
      purpose of putting me out of my misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name, and a parchment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a parchment upon your majesty&rsquo;s table; and for his name&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Vicomte de Bragelonne, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Vicomte de Bragelonne!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed the king; changing from a fit of
      laughter to the most profound stupor, and then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
      while he wiped his forehead, which was bedewed with perspiration, he again
      murmured, &ldquo;Bragelonne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bragelonne, who was affianced to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;he has been in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I can assure you, sire, he is there no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he in Paris, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is at Minimes, sire, where he is waiting for me, as I have already had
      the honor of telling you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and many things besides. Perhaps your majesty would like to look at
      the letter I have received from him;&rdquo; and Saint-Aignan drew from his
      pocket the note we are already acquainted with. &ldquo;When your majesty has
      read the letter, I will tell you how it reached me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king read it in a great agitation, and immediately said, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sire; your majesty knows a certain carved lock, closing a certain
      door of carved ebony, which separates a certain apartment from a certain
      blue and white sanctuary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; Louise&rsquo;s boudoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire. Well, it was in the keyhole of that lock that I found yonder
      note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who placed it there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either M. de Bragelonne, or the devil himself; but, inasmuch as the note
      smells of musk and not of sulphur, I conclude that it must be, not the
      devil, but M. de Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis bent his head, and seemed absorbed in sad and bitter thought.
      Perhaps something like remorse was at that moment passing through his
      heart. &ldquo;The secret is discovered,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I shall do my utmost that the secret dies in the breast of the man
      who possesses it!&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, in a tone of bravado, as he moved
      towards the door; but a gesture of the king made him pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where they await me, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fight, in all probability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> fight!&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;One moment, if you please,
      monsieur le comte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan shook his head, as a rebellious child does, whenever any one
      interferes to prevent him throwing himself into a well, or playing with a
      knife. &ldquo;But, sire,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; continued the king. &ldquo;I want to be enlightened a
      little further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon all points, if your majesty will be pleased to interrogate me,&rdquo;
       replied Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;I will throw what light I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that M. de Bragelonne had penetrated into that room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter which I found in the keyhole told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that it was De Bragelonne who put it there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who but himself would have dared to undertake such a mission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. How was he able to get into your rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is very serious, inasmuch as all the doors were closed, and my
      lackey, Basque, had the keys in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lackey must have been bribed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, sire; for if he had been bribed, those who did so would not
      have sacrificed the poor fellow, whom, it is not unlikely, they might want
      to turn to further use by and by, in showing so clearly that it was he
      whom they had made use of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true. And now I can only form one conjecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what it is, sire, and we shall see if it is the same that has
      presented itself to my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he effected an entrance by means of the staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sire, that seems to me more than probable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt that some one must have sold the secret of the
      trap-door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either sold it or given it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you make that distinction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there are certain persons, sire, who, being above the price of
      treason, give, and do not sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire! Your majesty&rsquo;s mind is too clear-sighted not to guess what I
      mean, and you will save me the embarrassment of naming the person I allude
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right: you mean Madame; I suppose her suspicions were aroused by
      your changing your lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame has keys of the apartments of her maids of honor, and she is
      powerful enough to discover what no one but yourself could do, or she
      would not be able to discover anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you suppose, then, that my sister must have entered into an alliance
      with Bragelonne, and has informed him of all the details of the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly even better still, for she perhaps accompanied him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way? through your own apartments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it impossible, sire? Well, listen to me. Your majesty knows
      that Madame is very fond of perfumes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she acquired that taste from my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vervain, particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is the scent she prefers to all others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sire! my apartments happen to smell very strongly of vervain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king remained silent and thoughtful for a few moments, and then
      resumed: &ldquo;But why should Madame take Bragelonne&rsquo;s part against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan could very easily have replied: &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s jealousy!&rdquo; The
      king probed his friend to the bottom of his heart to ascertain if he had
      learned the secret of his flirtation with his sister-in-law. But
      Saint-Aignan was not an ordinary courtier; he did not lightly run the risk
      of finding out family secrets; and he was too a friend of the Muses not to
      think very frequently of poor Ovidius Naso, whose eyes shed so many tears
      in expiation of his crime for having once beheld something, one hardly
      knows what, in the palace of Augustus. He therefore passed by Madame&rsquo;s
      secret very skillfully. But as he had shown no ordinary sagacity in
      indicating Madame&rsquo;s presence in his rooms in company with Bragelonne, it
      was necessary, of course, for him to repay with interest the king&rsquo;s <i>amour
      propre</i>, and reply plainly to the question which had been put to him
      of: &ldquo;Why has Madame taken Bragelonne&rsquo;s part against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; replied Saint-Aignan. &ldquo;Your majesty forgets, I presume, that the
      Comte de Guiche is the intimate friend of the Vicomte de Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see the connection, however,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I beg your pardon, then, sire; but I thought the Comte de Guiche was
      a very great friend of Madame&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; the king returned; &ldquo;there is no occasion to search any
      further, the blow came from that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is not your majesty of opinion that, in order to ward it off, it will
      be necessary to deal another blow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but not one of the kind given in the Bois de Vincennes,&rdquo; replied the
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, sire,&rdquo; said Saint-Aignan, &ldquo;that I am a gentleman, and that I
      have been challenged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The challenge neither concerns nor was it intended for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am the man, sire, who has been expected at the Minimes, sire,
      during the last hour and more; and I shall be dishonored if I do not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first honor and duty of a gentleman is obedience to his sovereign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I order you to remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obey, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your majesty pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, I wish to have the whole of this affair explained; I wish to
      know how it is that I have been so insolently trifled with, as to have the
      sanctuary of my affections pried into. It is not you, Saint-Aignan, whose
      business it is to punish those who have acted in this manner, for it is
      not your honor they have attacked, but my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore your majesty not to overwhelm M. de Bragelonne with your wrath,
      for although in the whole of this affair he may have shown himself
      deficient in prudence, he has not been so in his feelings of loyalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! I shall know how to decide between the just and the unjust, even
      in the height of my anger. But take care that not a word of this is
      breathed to Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do with regard to M. de Bragelonne? He will be seeking
      me in every direction, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall either have spoken to him, or taken care that he has been spoken
      to, before the evening is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me once more entreat your majesty to be indulgent towards him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been indulgent long enough, comte,&rdquo; said Louis XIV., frowning
      severely; &ldquo;it is now quite time to show certain persons that I am master
      in my own palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king had hardly pronounced these words, which betokened that a fresh
      feeling of irritation was mingling with the recollections of old, when an
      usher appeared at the door of the cabinet. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; inquired
      the king, &ldquo;and why do you presume to come when I have not summoned you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the usher, &ldquo;your majesty desired me to permit M. le Comte de
      la Fere to pass freely on any and every occasion, when he might wish to
      speak to your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Comte de la Fere is now waiting to see your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king and Saint-Aignan at this reply exchanged a look which betrayed
      more uneasiness than surprise. Louis hesitated for a moment, but
      immediately afterwards, seeming to make up his mind, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Saint-Aignan, and find Louise; inform her of the plot against us; do
      not let her be ignorant that Madame will return to her system of
      persecutions against her, and that she has set those to work who would
      have found it far safer to remain neuter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Louise gets nervous and frightened, reassure her as much as you can;
      tell her that the king&rsquo;s affection is an impenetrable shield over her; if,
      which I suspect is the case, she already knows everything, or if she has
      already been herself subjected to an attack of some kind or other from any
      quarter, tell her, be sure to tell her, Saint-Aignan,&rdquo; added the king,
      trembling with passion, &ldquo;tell her, I say, that this time, instead of
      defending her, I will avenge her, and that too so terribly that no one
      will in future even dare to raise his eyes towards her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all. Go as quickly as you can, and remain faithful; for, you who
      live in the midst of this stake of infernal torments, have not, like
      myself, the hope of the paradise beyond it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan exhausted himself in protestations of devotion, took the
      king&rsquo;s hand, kissed it, and left the room radiant with delight.

    <h2>
      Chapter LVIII. King and Noble.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king endeavored to recover his self-possession as quickly as possible,
      in order to meet M. de la Fere with an untroubled countenance. He clearly
      saw it was not mere chance that had induced the comte&rsquo;s visit, he had some
      vague impression of its importance; but he felt that to a man of Athos&rsquo;s
      tone of mind, to one of such a high order of intellect, his first
      reception ought not to present anything either disagreeable or otherwise
      than kind and courteous. As soon as the king had satisfied himself that,
      as far as appearances went, he was perfectly calm again, he gave
      directions to the ushers to introduce the comte. A few minutes afterwards
      Athos, in full court dress, and with his breast covered with the orders
      that he alone had the right to wear at the court of France, presented
      himself with so grave and solemn an air that the king perceived, at the
      first glance, that he was not deceived in his anticipations. Louis
      advanced a step towards the comte, and, with a smile, held out his hand to
      him, over which Athos bowed with the air of the deepest respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Comte de la Fere,&rdquo; said the king rapidly, &ldquo;you are so seldom
      here, that it is a real piece of good fortune to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos bowed and replied, &ldquo;I should wish always to enjoy the happiness of
      being near your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone, however, in which this reply was conveyed, evidently signified,
      &ldquo;I should wish to be one of your majesty&rsquo;s advisers, to save you the
      commission of faults.&rdquo; The king felt it so, and determined in this man&rsquo;s
      presence to preserve all the advantages which could be derived from his
      command over himself, as well as from his rank and position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you have something to say to me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had it not been so, I should not have presumed to present myself before
      your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak quickly, I am anxious to satisfy you,&rdquo; returned the king, seating
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am persuaded,&rdquo; replied Athos, in a somewhat agitated tone of voice,
      &ldquo;that your majesty will give me every satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the king, with a certain haughtiness of manner, &ldquo;you have come
      to lodge a complaint here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a complaint,&rdquo; returned Athos, &ldquo;only in the event of your
      majesty&mdash;but if you will deign to permit me, sire, I will begin the
      conversation from the very commencement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty will remember that at the period of the Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s
      departure, I had the honor of an interview with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At or about that period, I think I remember you did; only, with regard to
      the subject of the conversation, I have quite forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos started, as he replied. &ldquo;I shall have the honor to remind your
      majesty of it. It was with regard to a formal demand I had addressed to
      you respecting a marriage which M. de Bragelonne wished to contract with
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought the king, &ldquo;we have come to it now.&mdash;I remember,&rdquo; he
      said, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that period,&rdquo; pursued Athos, &ldquo;your majesty was so kind and generous
      towards M. de Bragelonne and myself, that not a single word which then
      fell from your lips has escaped my memory; and, when I asked your majesty
      to accord me Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s hand for M. de Bragelonne, you
      refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; said Louis, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alleging,&rdquo; Athos hastened to say, &ldquo;that the young lady had no position in
      society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis could hardly force himself to listen with an appearance of royal
      propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; added Athos, &ldquo;she had but little fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king threw himself back in his armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That her extraction was indifferent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A renewed impatience on the part of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And little beauty,&rdquo; added Athos, pitilessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last bolt buried itself deep in the king&rsquo;s heart, and made him almost
      bound from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a good memory, monsieur,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I invariably have, on occasions when I have had the distinguished honor
      of an interview with your majesty,&rdquo; retorted the comte, without being in
      the least disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good: it is admitted that I said all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thanked your majesty for your remarks at the time, because they
      testified an interest in M. de Bragelonne which did him much honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you may possibly remember,&rdquo; said the king, very deliberately, &ldquo;that
      you had the greatest repugnance for this marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that you solicited my permission, much against your own inclination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And finally, I remember, for I have a memory nearly as good as your own;
      I remember, I say, that you observed at the time: &lsquo;I do not believe that
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere loves M. de Bragelonne.&rsquo; Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blow told well, but Athos did not draw back. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have
      already begged your majesty&rsquo;s forgiveness; but there are certain
      particulars in that conversation which are only intelligible from the <i>denouement</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is the <i>denouement</i>, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This: that your majesty then said, &lsquo;that you would defer the marriage out
      of regard for M. de Bragelonne&rsquo;s own interests.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king remained silent. &ldquo;M. de Bragelonne is now so exceedingly unhappy
      that he cannot any longer defer asking your majesty for a solution of the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king turned pale; Athos looked at him with fixed attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said the king, with considerable hesitation, &ldquo;does M. de
      Bragelonne request?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely the very thing that I came to ask your majesty for at my last
      audience, namely, your majesty&rsquo;s consent to his marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king remained perfectly silent. &ldquo;The questions which referred to the
      different obstacles in the way are all now quite removed for us,&rdquo;
       continued Athos. &ldquo;Mademoiselle de la Valliere, without fortune, birth, or
      beauty, is not the less on that account the only good match in the world
      for M. de Bragelonne, since he loves this young girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king pressed his hands impatiently together. &ldquo;Does your majesty
      hesitate?&rdquo; inquired the comte, without losing a particle of either his
      firmness of his politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not hesitate&mdash;I refuse,&rdquo; replied the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos paused a moment, as if to collect himself: &ldquo;I have had the honor,&rdquo;
       he said, in a mild tone, &ldquo;to observe to your majesty that no obstacle now
      interferes with M. de Bragelonne&rsquo;s affections, and that his determination
      seems unalterable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my will&mdash;and that is an obstacle, I should imagine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the most serious of all,&rdquo; Athos replied quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may we, therefore, be permitted to ask your majesty, with the
      greatest humility, your reason for this refusal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason!&mdash;A question to me!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A demand, sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, leaning with both his hands upon the table, said, in a deep tone
      of concentrated passion: &ldquo;You have lost all recollection of what is usual
      at court. At court, please to remember, no one ventures to put a question
      to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, sire; but if men do not question, they conjecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conjecture! What may that mean, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very frequently, sire, conjecture with regard to a particular subject
      implies a want of frankness on the part of the king&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a want of confidence on the part of the subject,&rdquo; pursued Athos,
      intrepidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget yourself,&rdquo; said the king, hurried away by anger in spite of
      all his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I am obliged to seek elsewhere for what I thought I should find in
      your majesty. Instead of obtaining a reply from you, I am compelled to
      make one for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king rose. &ldquo;Monsieur le comte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have now given you all the
      time I had at my disposal.&rdquo; This was a dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied the comte, &ldquo;I have not yet had time to tell your majesty
      what I came with the express object of saying, and I so rarely see your
      majesty that I ought to avail myself of the opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now you spoke rudely of conjectures; you are now becoming offensive,
      monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire! offend your majesty! I?&mdash;never! All my life through I have
      maintained that kings are above all other men, not only from their rank
      and power, but from their nobleness of heart and their true dignity of
      mind. I never can bring myself to believe that my sovereign, he who passed
      his word to me, did so with a mental reservation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? what mental reservation do you allude to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain my meaning,&rdquo; said Athos, coldly. &ldquo;If, in refusing
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere to Monsieur de Bragelonne, your majesty had
      some other object in view than the happiness and fortune of the vicomte&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You perceive, monsieur, that you are offending me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, in requiring the vicomte to delay his marriage, your majesty&rsquo;s only
      object was to remove the gentleman to whom Mademoiselle de la Valliere was
      engaged&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur! monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard it said so in every direction, sire. Your majesty&rsquo;s
      affection for Mademoiselle de la Valliere is spoken of on all sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king tore his gloves, which he had been biting for some time. &ldquo;Woe to
      those,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;who interfere in my affairs. I have made up my mind to
      take a particular course, and I will break through every obstacle in my
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What obstacle?&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king stopped short, like a horse which, having taken the bit between
      his teeth and run away, finds it has slipped it back again, and that his
      career is checked. &ldquo;I love Mademoiselle de la Valliere,&rdquo; he said suddenly,
      with mingled nobleness of feeling and passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interrupted Athos, &ldquo;that does not preclude your majesty from
      allowing M. de Bragelonne to marry Mademoiselle de la Valliere. The
      sacrifice is worthy of so great a monarch; it is fully merited by M. de
      Bragelonne, who has already rendered great service to your majesty, and
      who may well be regarded as a brave and worthy man. Your majesty,
      therefore, in renouncing the affection you entertain, offers a proof at
      once of generosity, gratitude, and good policy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de la Valliere does not love M. de Bragelonne,&rdquo; said the
      king, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your majesty know that to be the case?&rdquo; remarked Athos, with a
      searching look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since a very short time, then; for doubtless, had your majesty known it
      when I first preferred my request, you would have taken the trouble to
      inform me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since a very short time, it is true, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos remained silent for a moment, and then resumed: &ldquo;In that case, I do
      not understand why your majesty should have sent M. de Bragelonne to
      London. That exile, and most properly so, too, is a matter of astonishment
      to every one who regards your majesty&rsquo;s honor with sincere affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who presumes to impugn my honor, Monsieur de la Fere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s honor, sire, is made up of the honor of his whole nobility.
      Whenever the king offends one of his gentlemen, that is, whenever he
      deprives him of the smallest particle of his honor, it is from him, from
      the king himself, that that portion of honor is stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de la Fere!&rdquo; said the king, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, you sent M. de Bragelonne to London either before you were
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere&rsquo;s lover, or since you have become so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, irritated beyond measure, especially because he felt that he was
      being mastered, endeavored to dismiss Athos by a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied the comte, &ldquo;I will tell you all; I will not leave your
      presence until I have been satisfied by your majesty or by myself;
      satisfied if you prove to me that you are right,&mdash;satisfied if I
      prove to you that you are wrong. Nay, sire, you can but listen to me. I am
      old now, and I am attached to everything that is really great and really
      powerful in your kingdom. I am of those who have shed their blood for your
      father and for yourself, without ever having asked a single favor either
      from yourself or from your father. I have never inflicted the slightest
      wrong or injury on any one in this world, and even kings are still my
      debtors. You can but listen to me, I repeat. I have come to ask you for an
      account of the honor of one of your servants whom you have deceived by a
      falsehood, or betrayed by want of heart of judgment. I know that these
      words irritate your majesty, but the facts themselves are killing us. I
      know that you are endeavoring to find some means whereby to chastise me
      for my frankness; but I know also the chastisement I will implore God to
      inflict upon you when I relate to Him your perjury and my son&rsquo;s
      unhappiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king during these remarks was walking hurriedly to and fro, his hand
      thrust into the breast of his coat, his head haughtily raised, his eyes
      blazing with wrath. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he cried, suddenly, &ldquo;if I acted towards
      you as a king, you would be already punished; but I am only a man, and I
      have the right to love in this world every one who loves me,&mdash;a
      happiness which is so rarely found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot pretend to such a right as a man any more than as a king,
      sire; or if you intend to exercise that right in a loyal manner, you
      should have told M. de Bragelonne so, and not have exiled him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too great a condescension, monsieur, to discuss these things with
      you,&rdquo; interrupted Louis XIV., with that majesty of air and manner he alone
      seemed able to give his look and his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hoping that you would reply to me,&rdquo; said the comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know my reply, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You already know my thoughts on the subject,&rdquo; was the Comte de la Fere&rsquo;s
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten you are speaking to the king, monsieur. It is a
      crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten you are destroying the lives of two men, sire. It is a
      mortal sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until I have said this: &lsquo;Son of Louis XIII., you begin your reign
      badly, for you begin it by abduction and disloyalty! My race&mdash;myself
      too&mdash;are now freed from all that affection and respect towards you,
      which I made my son swear to observe in the vaults of Saint-Denis, in the
      presence of the relics of your noble forefathers. You are now become our
      enemy, sire, and henceforth we have nothing to do save with Heaven alone,
      our sole master. Be warned, be warned, sire.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you threaten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Athos, sadly, &ldquo;I have as little bravado as fear in my soul.
      The God of whom I spoke to you is now listening to me; He knows that for
      the safety and honor of your crown I would even yet shed every drop of
      blood twenty years of civil and foreign warfare have left in my veins. I
      can well say, then, that I threaten the king as little as I threaten the
      man; but I tell you, sire, you lose two servants; for you have destroyed
      faith in the heart of the father, and love in the heart of the son; the
      one ceases to believe in the royal word, the other no longer believes in
      the loyalty of the man, or the purity of woman: the one is dead to every
      feeling of respect, the other to obedience. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, Athos broke his sword across his knee, slowly placed the two
      pieces upon the floor, and saluting the king, who was almost choking from
      rage and shame, he quitted the cabinet. Louis, who sat near the table,
      completely overwhelmed, was several minutes before he could collect
      himself; but he suddenly rose and rang the bell violently. &ldquo;Tell M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan to come here,&rdquo; he said to the terrified ushers.

    <h2>
      Chapter LIX. After the Storm.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our readers will doubtlessly have been asking themselves how it happened
      that Athos, of whom not a word has been said for some time past, arrived
      so very opportunely at court. We will, without delay, endeavor to satisfy
      their curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos, faithful to his duty as an arranger of affairs, had, immediately
      after leaving the Palais Royal, set off to join Raoul at the Minimes in
      the Bois de Vincennes, and had related everything, even to the smallest
      details, which had passed between Saint-Aignan and himself. He finished by
      saying that the message which the king had sent to his favorite would
      probably not occasion more than a short delay, and that Saint-Aignan, as
      soon as he could leave the king, would not lose a moment in accepting the
      invitation Raoul had sent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Raoul, less credulous than his old friend, had concluded from
      Porthos&rsquo;s recital that if Saint-Aignan was going to the king, Saint-Aignan
      would tell the king everything, and that the king would most assuredly
      forbid Saint-Aignan to obey the summons he had received to the hostile
      meeting. The consequence of his reflections was, that he had left Porthos
      to remain at the place appointed for the meeting, in the very improbable
      case that Saint-Aignan would come there; having endeavored to make Porthos
      promise that he would not remain there more than an hour or an hour and a
      half at the very longest. Porthos, however, formally refused to do
      anything of the kind, but, on the contrary, installed himself in the
      Minimes as if he were going to take root there, making Raoul promise that
      when he had been to see his father, he would return to his own apartments,
      in order that Porthos&rsquo;s servant might know where to find him in case M. de
      Saint-Aignan should happen to come to the rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bragelonne had left Vincennes, and proceeded at once straight to the
      apartments of Athos, who had been in Paris during the last two days, the
      comte having been already informed of what had taken place, by a letter
      from D&rsquo;Artagnan. Raoul arrived at his father&rsquo;s; Athos, after having held
      out his hand to him, and embraced him most affectionately, made a sign for
      him to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you come to me as a man would go to a friend, vicomte, whenever he
      is suffering; tell me, therefore, what is it that brings you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed, and began his recital; more than once in the course
      of it his tears almost choked his utterance, and a sob, checked in his
      throat, compelled him to suspend his narrative for a few minutes. Athos
      most probably already knew how matters stood, as we have just now said
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had already written to him; but, preserving until the
      conclusion that calm, unruffled composure of manner which constituted the
      almost superhuman side of his character, he replied, &ldquo;Raoul, I do not
      believe there is a word of truth in these rumors; I do not believe in the
      existence of what you fear, although I do not deny that persons best
      entitled to the fullest credit have already conversed with me on the
      subject. In my heart and soul I think it utterly impossible that the king
      could be guilty of such an outrage on a gentleman. I will answer for the
      king, therefore, and will soon bring you back the proof of what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, wavering like a drunken man between what he had seen with his own
      eyes and the imperturbable faith he had in a man who had never told a
      falsehood, bowed and simply answered, &ldquo;Go, then, monsieur le comte; I will
      await your return.&rdquo; And he sat down, burying his face in his hands. Athos
      dressed, and then left him, in order to wait upon the king; the result of
      that interview is already known to our readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to his lodgings, Raoul, pale and dejected, had not
      quitted his attitude of despair. At the sound, however, of the opening
      doors, and of his father&rsquo;s footsteps as he approached him, the young man
      raised his head. Athos&rsquo;s face was very pale, his head uncovered, and his
      manner full of seriousness; he gave his cloak and hat to the lackey,
      dismissed him with a gesture, and sat down near Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur,&rdquo; inquired the young man, &ldquo;are you convinced yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, Raoul; the king loves Mademoiselle de la Valliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He confesses it, then?&rdquo; cried Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but the king spoke to you about her. What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says that she loves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you see&mdash;you see, monsieur!&rdquo; said the young man, with a gesture
      of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul,&rdquo; resumed the comte, &ldquo;I told the king, believe me, all that you
      yourself could possibly have urged, and I believe I did so in becoming
      language, though sufficiently firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you say to him, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him, Raoul, that everything was now at an end between him and
      ourselves; that you would never serve him again. I told him that I, too,
      should remain aloof. Nothing further remains for me, then, but to be
      satisfied of one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether you have determined to adopt any steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any steps? Regarding what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With reference to your disappointed affection, and&mdash;your ideas of
      vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur, with regard to my affection, I shall, perhaps, some day or
      other, succeed in tearing it from my heart; I trust I shall do so, aided
      by Heaven&rsquo;s merciful help, and your own wise exhortations. As far as
      vengeance is concerned, it occurred to me only when under the influence of
      an evil thought, for I could not revenge myself upon the one who is
      actually guilty; I have, therefore, already renounced every idea of
      revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you no longer think of seeking a quarrel with M. de Saint-Aignan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur; I sent him a challenge: if M. de Saint-Aignan accepts it, I
      will maintain it; if he does not take it up, I will leave things as they
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And La Valliere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot, I know, have seriously thought that I should dream of
      revenging myself upon a woman!&rdquo; replied Raoul, with a smile so sad that a
      tear started even to the eyes of his father, who had so many times in the
      course of his life bowed beneath his own sorrows and those of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand to Raoul, which the latter seized most eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, monsieur le comte, you are quite satisfied that the misfortune is
      one beyond all remedy?&rdquo; inquired the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that I still live in hope,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;and you pity me. Oh,
      it is indeed horrible suffering for me to despise, as I am bound to do,
      the one I have loved so devotedly. If I had but some real cause of
      complaint against her, I should be happy, I should be able to forgive
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos looked at his son with a profoundly sorrowful air, for the words
      Raoul had just pronounced seemed to have issued out of his own heart. At
      this moment the servant announced M. d&rsquo;Artagnan. This name sounded very
      differently to the ears of Athos and Raoul. The musketeer entered the room
      with a vague smile on his lips. Raoul paused. Athos walked towards his
      friend with an expression of face that did not escape Bragelonne.
      D&rsquo;Artagnan answered Athos&rsquo;s look by an imperceptible movement of the
      eyelid; and then, advancing towards Raoul, whom he took by the hand, he
      said, addressing both father and son, &ldquo;Well, you are trying to console
      this poor boy, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, kind and good as usual, have come to help me in my difficult
      task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, Athos pressed D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s hand between both his own.
      Raoul fancied he observed in this pressure something beyond the sense his
      mere words conveyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the musketeer, smoothing his mustache with the hand that
      Athos had left free, &ldquo;yes, I have come too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are most welcome, chevalier; not for the consolation you bring with
      you, but on your own account. I am already consoled,&rdquo; said Raoul; and he
      attempted to smile, but the effort was more sad than any tears D&rsquo;Artagnan
      had ever seen shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all well and good, then,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; continued Raoul, &ldquo;you have arrived just as the comte was about to
      give me the details of his interview with the king. You will allow the
      comte to continue?&rdquo; added the young man, as, with his eyes fixed on the
      musketeer, he seemed to read the very depths of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His interview with the king?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a tone so natural and
      unassumed that there was no means of suspecting that his astonishment was
      feigned. &ldquo;You have seen the king, then, Athos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos smiled as he said, &ldquo;Yes, I have seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed; you were unaware, then, that the comte had seen his majesty?&rdquo;
       inquired Raoul, half reassured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I am less uneasy,&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uneasy&mdash;and about what?&rdquo; inquired Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, monsieur,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;but knowing so well the regard and
      affection you have for me, I was afraid you might possibly have expressed
      somewhat plainly to his majesty my own sufferings and your indignation,
      and that the king had consequently&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that the king had consequently?&rdquo; repeated D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;well, go on,
      finish what you were going to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have now to ask you to forgive me, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; said Raoul.
      &ldquo;For a moment, and I cannot help confessing it, I trembled lest you had
      come here, not as M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, but as captain of the musketeers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad, my poor boy,&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a burst of laughter, in
      which an exact observer might perhaps have wished to have heard a little
      more frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mad; and do you know what I would advise you to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, monsieur, for the advice is sure to be good, as it comes from
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then; I advise you, after your long journey from England,
      after your visit to M. de Guiche, after your visit to Madame, after your
      visit to Porthos, after your journey to Vincennes, I advise you, I say, to
      take a few hours&rsquo; rest; go and lie down, sleep for a dozen hours, and when
      you wake up, go and ride one of my horses until you have tired him to
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And drawing Raoul towards him, he embraced him as he would have done his
      own child. Athos did the like; only it was very visible that the kiss was
      still more affectionate, and the pressure of his lips even warmer with the
      father than with the friend. The young man again looked at both his
      companions, endeavoring to penetrate their real meaning or their real
      feelings with the utmost strength of his intelligence; but his look was
      powerless upon the smiling countenance of the musketeer or upon the calm
      and composed features of the Comte de la Fere. &ldquo;Where are you going,
      Raoul?&rdquo; inquired the latter, seeing that Bragelonne was preparing to go
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my own apartments,&rdquo; replied the latter, in his soft, sad voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be sure to find you there, then, if we should have anything to
      say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; but do you suppose it likely you will have something to
      say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, something fresh to console you with,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, pushing him
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, observing the perfect composure which marked every gesture of his
      two friends, quitted the comte&rsquo;s room, carrying away with him nothing but
      the individual feeling of his own particular distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since that is the case, I need only think of
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And wrapping himself up in his cloak, in order to conceal from the
      passers-by in the streets his gloomy and sorrowful face, he quitted them,
      for the purpose of returning to his own rooms, as he had promised Porthos.
      The two friends watched the young man as he walked away with a feeling of
      genuine disinterested pity; only each expressed it in a different way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Raoul!&rdquo; said Athos, sighing deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Raoul!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, shrugging his shoulders.

    <h2>
      Chapter LX. Heu! Miser!
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Raoul!&rdquo; had said Athos. &ldquo;Poor Raoul!&rdquo; had said D&rsquo;Artagnan: and, in
      point of fact, to be pitied by both these men, Raoul must indeed have been
      most unhappy. And therefore, when he found himself alone, face to face, as
      it were, with his own troubles, leaving behind him the intrepid friend and
      the indulgent father; when he recalled the avowal of the king&rsquo;s affection,
      which had robbed him of Louise de la Valliere, whom he loved so deeply, he
      felt his heart almost breaking, as indeed we all have at least once in our
      lives, at the first illusion destroyed, the first affection betrayed.
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;all is over, then. Nothing is now left me in this
      world. Nothing to look forward to, nothing to hope for. Guiche has told me
      so, my father has told me so, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan has told me so. All life is
      but an idle dream. The future which I have been hopelessly pursuing for
      the last ten years is a dream! the union of hearts, a dream! a life of
      love and happiness, a dream! Poor fool that I am,&rdquo; he continued, after a
      pause, &ldquo;to dream away my existence aloud, publicly, and in the face of
      others, friends and enemies&mdash;and for what purpose, too? in order that
      my friends may be saddened by my troubles, and my enemies may laugh at my
      sorrows. And so my unhappiness will soon become a notorious disgrace, a
      public scandal; and who knows but that to-morrow I may even be a public
      laughing-stock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, despite the composure which he had promised his father and D&rsquo;Artagnan
      to observe, Raoul could not resist uttering a few words of darkest menace.
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if my name were De Wardes, and if I had the
      pliancy of character and strength of will of M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, I should
      laugh, with my lips at least; I should convince other women that this
      perfidious girl, honored by the affection I have wasted on her, leaves me
      only one regret, that of having been abused and deceived by her seemingly
      modest and irreproachable conduct; a few might perhaps fawn on the king by
      jesting at my expense; I should put myself on the track of some of those
      buffoons; I should chastise a few of them, perhaps; the men would fear me,
      and by the time I had laid three dying or dead at my feet, I should be
      adored by the women. Yes, yes, that, indeed, would be the proper course to
      adopt, and the Comte de la Fere himself would not object to it. Has not he
      also been tried, in his earlier days, in the same manner as I have just
      been tried myself? Did he not replace affection by intoxication? He has
      often told me so. Why should I not replace love by pleasure? He must have
      suffered as much as I suffer, even more&mdash;if that is possible. The
      history of one man is the history of all, a dragging trial, more or less
      prolonged, more or less bitter&mdash;sorrowful. The note of human nature
      is nothing but one sustained cry. But what are the sufferings of others
      compared to those from which I am now suffering? Does the open wound in
      another&rsquo;s breast soften the anguish of the gaping ulcer in our own? Does
      the blood which is welling from another man&rsquo;s side stanch that which is
      pouring from our own? Does the general grief of our fellow-creatures
      lessen our own private and particular woe? No, no, each suffers on his own
      account, each struggles with his own grief, each sheds his own tears. And
      besides,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;what has my life been up to the present moment? A
      cold, barren, sterile arena, in which I have always fought for others,
      never for myself. Sometimes for a king, sometimes for a woman. The king
      has betrayed, the woman disdained me. Miserable, unlucky wretch that I am!
      Women! Can I not make all expiate the crime of one of their sex? What does
      that need? To have a heart no longer, or to forget that I ever had one; to
      be strong, even against weakness itself; to lean always, even when one
      feels that the support is giving way. What is needed to attain, or succeed
      in all that? To be young, handsome, strong, valiant, rich. I am, or shall
      be, all that. But honor?&rdquo; he still continued, &ldquo;and what is honor after
      all? A theory which every man understands in his own way. My father tells
      me: &lsquo;Honor is the consideration of what is due to others, and particularly
      what is due to oneself.&rsquo; But Guiche, and Manicamp, and Saint-Aignan
      particularly, would say to me: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s honor? Honor consists in studying
      and yielding to the passions and pleasures of one&rsquo;s king.&rsquo; Honor such as
      that indeed, is easy and productive enough. With honor like that, I can
      keep my post at the court, become a gentleman of the chamber, and accept
      the command of a regiment, which may at any time be presented to me. With
      honor such as that, I can be duke and peer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stain which that woman has stamped upon me, the grief that has broken
      my heart, the heart of the friend and playmate of her childhood, in no way
      affects M. de Bragelonne, an excellent officer, a courageous leader, who
      will cover himself with glory at the first encounter, and who will become
      a hundred times greater than Mademoiselle de la Valliere is to-day, the
      mistress of the king&mdash;for the king will not marry her&mdash;and the
      more publicly he will proclaim her as his mistress, the more opaque will
      grow the shadow of shame he casts upon her face, in the guise of a crown;
      and in proportion as others despise, as I despise her, I shall be gleaning
      honors in the field. Alas! we had walked together side by side, she and I,
      during the earliest, the brightest, the most angelic portion of our
      existence, hand in hand along the charming path of life, covered with the
      blossoms of youth; and then, alas! we reach a cross-road, where she
      separates herself from me, in which we have to follow a different route,
      whereby we become more and more widely separated from each other. And to
      attain the end of this path, oh, Heaven! I am now alone, in utter despair,
      and crushed to the very earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the sinister reflections in which Raoul indulged, when his foot
      mechanically paused at the door of his own dwelling. He had reached it
      without remarking the streets through which he passed, without knowing how
      he had come; he pushed open the door, continued to advance, and ascended
      the staircase. The staircase, as in most of the houses at that period, was
      very dark, and the landings most obscure. Raoul lived on the first floor;
      he paused in order to ring. Olivain appeared, took his sword and cloak
      from his hands; Raoul himself opened the door which, from the
      ante-chamber, led into a small <i>salon</i>, richly furnished enough for
      the <i>salon</i> of a young man, and completely filled with flowers by
      Olivain, who, knowing his master&rsquo;s tastes, had shown himself studiously
      attentive in gratifying them, without caring whether his master perceived
      his attention or not. There was a portrait of La Valliere in the <i>salon</i>,
      which had been drawn by herself and given by her to Raoul. This portrait,
      fastened above a large easy chair covered with dark colored damask, was
      the first point towards which Raoul bent his steps&mdash;the first object
      on which he fixed his eyes. It was, moreover, Raoul&rsquo;s usual habit to do
      so; every time he entered his room, this portrait, before anything else,
      attracted his attention. This time, as usual, he walked straight up to the
      portrait, placed his knees upon the arm chair, and paused to look at it
      sadly. His arms were crossed upon his breast, his head slightly thrown
      back, his eyes filled with tears, his mouth worked into a bitter smile. He
      looked at the portrait of the one he had so tenderly loved; and then all
      that he had said passed before his mind again, all that he had suffered
      seemed again to assail his heart; and, after a long silence, he murmured
      for the third time, &ldquo;Miserable, unhappy wretch that I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly pronounced these words, when he heard the sound of a sigh
      and a groan behind him. He turned sharply round and perceived, in the
      angle of the <i>salon</i>, standing up, a bending veiled female figure,
      which he had been the means of concealing behind the door as he opened it,
      and which he had not perceived as he entered. He advanced towards the
      figure, whose presence in his room had not been announced to him; and as
      he bowed, and inquired at the same moment who she was, she suddenly raised
      her head, and removed the veil from her face, revealing her pale and
      sorrow-stricken features. Raoul staggered back as if he had seen a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise!&rdquo; he cried, in a tone of such absolute despair, one could hardly
      have thought the human voice was capable of so desponding a cry, without
      the snapping of the human heart.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere&mdash;for it was indeed she&mdash;advanced a
      few steps towards him. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Louise,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this interval, short as it had been, was quite sufficient for Raoul to
      recover himself. &ldquo;You, mademoiselle?&rdquo; he said; and then added, in an
      indefinable tone, &ldquo;You here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Raoul,&rdquo; the young girl replied, &ldquo;I have been waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. When I came into the room I was not aware&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;but I entreated Olivain not to tell you&mdash;&rdquo; She
      hesitated; and as Raoul did not attempt to interrupt her, a moment&rsquo;s
      silence ensued, during which the sound of their throbbing hearts might
      have been heard, not in unison with each other, but the one beating as
      violently as the other. It was for Louise to speak, and she made an effort
      to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to speak to you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was absolutely necessary that I
      should see you&mdash;myself&mdash;alone. I have not hesitated to adopt a
      step which must remain secret; for no one, except yourself, could
      understand my motive, Monsieur de Bragelonne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, mademoiselle,&rdquo; Raoul stammered out, almost breathless from
      emotion, &ldquo;as far as I am concerned, and despite the good opinion you have
      of me, I confess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me the great kindness to sit down and listen to me?&rdquo; said
      Louise, interrupting him with her soft, sweet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bragelonne looked at her for a moment; then mournfully shaking his head,
      he sat, or rather fell down on a chair. &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cast a glance all round her. This look was a timid entreaty, and
      implored secrecy far more effectually than her expressed words had done a
      few minutes before. Raoul rouse, and went to the door, which he opened.
      &ldquo;Olivain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not within for any one.&rdquo; And then, turning
      towards Louise, he added, &ldquo;Is not that what you wished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have produced a greater effect upon Louise than these few
      words, which seemed to signify, &ldquo;You see that I still understand you.&rdquo; She
      passed a handkerchief across her eyes, in order to remove a rebellious
      tear which she could not restrain; and then, having collected herself for
      a moment, she said, &ldquo;Raoul, do not turn your kind, frank look away from
      me. You are not one of those men who despise a woman for having given her
      heart to another, even though her affection might render him unhappy, or
      might wound his pride.&rdquo; Raoul did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; continued La Valliere, &ldquo;it is only too true, my cause is a bad
      one, and I cannot tell in what way to begin. It will be better for me, I
      think, to relate to you, very simply, everything that has befallen me. As
      I shall speak but the pure and simple truth, I shall always find my path
      clear before me in spite of the obscurity and obstacles I have to brave in
      order to solace my heart, which is full to overflowing, and wishes to pour
      itself out at your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul continued to preserve the same unbroken silence. La Valliere looked
      at him with an air that seemed to say, &ldquo;Encourage me; for pity&rsquo;s sake, but
      a single word!&rdquo; But Raoul did not open his lips; and the young girl was
      obliged to continue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;M. de Saint-Aignan came to me by the king&rsquo;s
      directions.&rdquo; She cast down her eyes as she said this; while Raoul, on his
      side, turned his away, in order to avoid looking at her. &ldquo;M. de
      Saint-Aignan came to me from the king,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;and told me that
      you knew all;&rdquo; and she attempted to look Raoul in the face, after
      inflicting this further wound upon him, in addition to the many others he
      had already received; but it was impossible to meet Raoul&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me you were incensed with me&mdash;and justly so, I admit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Raoul looked at the young girl, and a smile full of disdain
      passed across his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I entreat you, do not say that you have had any
      other feeling against me than that of anger merely. Raoul, wait until I
      have told you all&mdash;wait until I have said to you all that I had to
      say&mdash;all that I came to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, by the strength of his iron will, forced his features to assume a
      calmer expression, and the disdainful smile upon his lip passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said La Valliere, &ldquo;in the first place, with my hands
      raised in entreaty towards you, with my forehead bowed to the ground
      before you, I entreat you, as the most generous, as the noblest of men, to
      pardon, to forgive me. If I have left you in ignorance of what was passing
      in my own bosom, never, at least, would I have consented to deceive you.
      Oh! I entreat you, Raoul&mdash;I implore you on my knees&mdash;answer me
      one word, even though you wrong me in doing so. Better, far better, an
      injurious word from your lips, than suspicion resting in your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire your subtlety of expression, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Raoul, making
      an effort to remain calm. &ldquo;To leave another in ignorance that you are
      deceiving him, is loyal; but to deceive him&mdash;it seems that would be
      very wrong, and that you would not do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, for a long time I thought that I loved you better than anything
      else; and so long as I believed in my affection for you, I told you that
      loved you. I could have sworn it on the altar; but a day came when I was
      undeceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, on that day, mademoiselle, knowing that I still continued to love
      you, true loyalty of conduct should have forced you to inform me you had
      ceased to love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But on that day, Raoul&mdash;on that day, when I read in the depths of my
      own heart, when I confessed to myself that you no longer filled my mind
      entirely, when I saw another future before me than that of being your
      friend, your life-long companion, your wife&mdash;on that day, Raoul, you
      were not, alas! any more beside me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you knew where I was, mademoiselle; you could have written to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul, I did not dare to do so. Raoul, I have been weak and cowardly. I
      knew you so thoroughly&mdash;I knew how devotedly you loved me, that I
      trembled at the bare idea of the grief I was about to cause you; and that
      is so true, Raoul, that this very moment I am now speaking to you, bending
      thus before you, my heart crushed in my bosom, my voice full of sighs, my
      eyes full of tears, it is so perfectly true, that I have no other defense
      than my frankness, I have no other sorrow greater than that which I read
      in your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul attempted to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the young girl, with a profound conviction, &ldquo;no, no; you will
      not do me so foul a wrong as to disguise your feelings before me now! You
      loved me; you were sure of your affection for me; you did not deceive
      yourself; you do not lie to your own heart&mdash;whilst I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
       And pale as death, her arms thrown despairingly above her head, she fell
      upon her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whilst you,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;you told me you loved me, and yet you loved
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, yes!&rdquo; cried the poor girl; &ldquo;alas, yes! I do love another; and that
      other&mdash;oh! for Heaven&rsquo;s sake let me say it, Raoul, for it is my only
      excuse&mdash;that other I love better than my own life, better than my own
      soul even. Forgive my fault, or punish my treason, Raoul. I came here in
      no way to defend myself, but merely to say to you: &lsquo;You know what it is to
      love!&rsquo;&mdash;in such a case am I! I love to that degree, that I would give
      my life, my very soul, to the man I love. If he should ever cease to love
      me, I shall die of grief and despair, unless Heaven come to my assistance,
      unless Heaven does show pity upon me. Raoul, I came here to submit myself
      to your will, whatever it might be&mdash;to die, if it were your wish I
      should die. Kill me, then, Raoul! if in your heart you believe I deserve
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Raoul: &ldquo;the woman who invites death is one
      who has nothing but her heart&rsquo;s blood to offer to her deceived and
      betrayed lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul uttered a deep sigh, as he exclaimed, &ldquo;And you love without being
      able to forget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love without a wish to forget; without a wish ever to love any one
      else,&rdquo; replied La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Raoul. &ldquo;You have said to me, in fact, all you had to
      say; all I could possibly wish to know. And now, mademoiselle, it is I who
      ask your forgiveness, for it is I who have almost been an obstacle in your
      life; I, too, who have been wrong, for, in deceiving myself, I helped to
      deceive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said La Valliere, &ldquo;I do not ask you so much as that, Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only am to blame, mademoiselle,&rdquo; continued Raoul, &ldquo;better informed than
      yourself of the difficulties of this life, I should have enlightened you.
      I ought not to have relied upon uncertainty; I ought to have extracted an
      answer from your heart, whilst I hardly even sought an acknowledgement
      from your lips. Once more, mademoiselle, it is I who ask your
      forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, impossible!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you are mocking me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, impossible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is impossible to be so good, and kind, ah! perfect to such a
      degree as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said Raoul, with a bitter smile, &ldquo;for presently you may say
      perhaps I did not love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you love me like an affectionate brother; let me hope that, Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a brother! undeceive yourself, Louise. I love you as a lover&mdash;as
      a husband, with the deepest, the truest, the fondest affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul, Raoul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a brother! Oh, Louise! I love you so deeply, that I would have shed my
      blood for you, drop by drop; I would, oh! how willingly, have suffered
      myself to be torn to pieces for your sake, have sacrificed my very future
      for you. I love you so deeply, Louise, that my heart feels dead and
      crushed within me,&mdash;my faith in human nature all is gone,&mdash;my
      eyes have lost their light; I loved you so deeply, that I now no longer
      see, think of, care for, anything, either in this world or the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul&mdash;dear Raoul! spare me, I implore you!&rdquo; cried La Valliere. &ldquo;Oh!
      if I had but known&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late, Louise; you love, you are happy in your affection; I read
      your happiness through your tears&mdash;behind the tears which the loyalty
      of your nature makes you shed; I feel the sighs your affection breathes
      forth. Louise, Louise, you have made me the most abjectly wretched man
      living; leave me, I entreat you. Adieu! adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! oh, forgive me, Raoul, for what I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not done much, much more? <i>Have I not told you that I love you
      still?</i>&rdquo; She buried her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to tell you that&mdash;do you hear me, Louise?&mdash;to tell you
      that, at such a moment as this, to tell you that, as I have told you, is
      to pronounce my own sentence of death. Adieu!&rdquo; La Valliere held out her
      hands to him in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought not to see each other again in this world,&rdquo; he said, and as she
      was on the point of crying out in bitter agony at this remark, he placed
      his hand on her mouth to stifle the exclamation. She pressed her lips upon
      it, and fell fainting to the ground. &ldquo;Olivain,&rdquo; said Raoul, &ldquo;take this
      young lady and bear her to the carriage which is waiting for her at the
      door.&rdquo; As Olivain lifted her up, Raoul made a movement as if to dart
      towards La Valliere, in order to give her a first and last kiss, but,
      stopping abruptly, he said, &ldquo;No! she is not mine. I am no thief&mdash;as
      is the king of France.&rdquo; And he returned to his room, whilst the lackey
      carried La Valliere, still fainting, to the carriage.

    <h2>
      Chapter LXII. What Raoul Had Guessed.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as Raoul had quitted Athos and D&rsquo;Artagnan, as the two exclamations
      that had followed his departure escaped their lips, they found themselves
      face to face alone. Athos immediately resumed the earnest air that he had
      assumed at D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what have you come to announce to me, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; inquired D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I do not see you in this way without some reason for it,&rdquo; said
      Athos, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will place you at your ease. The king is furious, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say he is not altogether pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have come to arrest me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, you have hit the very mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I expected it. I am quite ready to go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deuce take it!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;what a hurry you are in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid of delaying you,&rdquo; said Athos, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have plenty of time. Are you not curious, besides, to know how things
      went on between the king and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be good enough to tell me, I will listen with the greatest of
      pleasure,&rdquo; said Athos, pointing out to D&rsquo;Artagnan a large chair, into
      which the latter threw himself, assuming the easiest possible attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will do so willingly enough,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;for the
      conversation is rather curious, I must say. In the first place the king
      sent for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I had left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were just going down the last steps of the staircase, as the
      musketeers told me. I arrived. My dear Athos, he was not red in the face
      merely, he was positively purple. I was not aware, of course, of what had
      passed; only, on the ground, lying on the floor, I saw a sword broken in
      two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Captain d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rsquo; cried the king, as soon as he saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;M. de la Fere has just left me; he is an insolent man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;An insolent man!&rsquo; I exclaimed, in such a tone that the king stopped
      suddenly short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Captain d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rsquo; resumed the king, with his teeth clenched, &lsquo;you
      will be good enough to listen to and hear me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is my duty, sire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have, out of consideration for M. de la Fere, wished to spare him&mdash;he
      is a man of whom I still retain some kind recollections&mdash;the
      discredit of being arrested in my palace. You will therefore take a
      carriage.&rsquo; At this I made a slight movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you object to arrest him yourself,&rsquo; continued the king, &lsquo;send me my
      captain of the guards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;there is no necessity for the captain of the guards,
      since I am on duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I should not like to annoy you,&rsquo; said the king, kindly, &lsquo;for you have
      always served me well, Monsieur D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You do not &ldquo;annoy&rdquo; me, sire,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I am on duty, that is all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said the king, in astonishment, &lsquo;I believe the comte is your
      friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If he were my father, sire, it would not make me less on duty than I
      am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king looked at me; he saw how unmoved my face was, and seemed
      satisfied. &lsquo;You will arrest M. le Comte de la Fere, then?&rsquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Most certainly, sire, if you give me the order to do so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well; I order you to do so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bowed, and replied, &lsquo;Where is the comte, sire?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You will look for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And am I to arrest him, wherever he may be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; but try that he may be at his own house. If he should have started
      for his own estate, leave Paris at once, and arrest him on his way
      thither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bowed; but as I did not move, he said, &lsquo;Well, what are you waiting
      for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For the order to arrest the comte, signed by yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king seemed annoyed; for, in point of fact, it was the exercise of a
      fresh act of authority, a repetition of the arbitrary act, if, indeed, it
      is to be considered as such. He took hold of his pen slowly, and evidently
      in no very good temper; and then he wrote, &lsquo;Order for M. le Chevalier
      d&rsquo;Artagnan, captain of my musketeers, to arrest M. le Comte de la Fere,
      wherever he is to be found.&rsquo; He then turned towards me; but I was looking
      on without moving a muscle of my face. In all probability he thought he
      perceived something like bravado in my tranquil manner, for he signed
      hurriedly, and then handing me the order, he said, &lsquo;Go, monsieur!&rsquo; I
      obeyed; and here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos pressed his friend&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Well, let us set off,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! surely,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you must have some trifling matters to
      arrange before you leave your apartments in this manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&mdash;not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know, D&rsquo;Artagnan, that I have always been a very simple traveler
      on this earth, ready to go to the end of the world by the order of my
      sovereign; ready to quit it at the summons of my Maker. What does a man
      who is thus prepared require in such a case?&mdash;a portmanteau, or a
      shroud. I am ready at this moment, as I have always been, my dear friend,
      and can accompany you at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Bragelonne&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought him up in the same principles I laid down for my own
      guidance; and you observed that, as soon as he perceived you, he guessed,
      that very moment, the motive of your visit. We have thrown him off his
      guard for a moment; but do not be uneasy, he is sufficiently prepared for
      my disgrace not to be too much alarmed at it. So, let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, let us go,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I broke my sword in the king&rsquo;s presence, and threw the pieces at his
      feet, I presume that will dispense with the necessity of delivering it
      over to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right; and besides that, what the deuce do you suppose I
      could do with your sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to walk behind, or before you?&rdquo; inquired Athos, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will walk arm in arm with me,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, as he took the
      comte&rsquo;s arm to descend the staircase; and in this manner they arrived at
      the landing. Grimaud, whom they had met in the ante-room, looked at them
      as they went out together in this manner, with some little uneasiness; his
      experience of affairs was quite sufficient to give him good reason to
      suspect that there was something wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is that you, Grimaud?&rdquo; said Athos, kindly. &ldquo;We are going&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take a turn in my carriage,&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a friendly
      nod of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimaud thanked D&rsquo;Artagnan by a grimace, which was evidently intended for
      a smile, and accompanied both the friends to the door. Athos entered first
      into the carriage; D&rsquo;Artagnan followed him without saying a word to the
      coachman. The departure had taken place so quietly, that it excited no
      disturbance or attention even in the neighborhood. When the carriage had
      reached the quays, &ldquo;You are taking me to the Bastile, I perceive,&rdquo; said
      Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I take you wherever you may choose to go; nowhere
      else, I can assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said the comte, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, surely, my dear friend,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you quite understand that
      I undertook the mission with no other object in view than that of carrying
      it out exactly as you liked. You surely did not expect that I was going to
      get you thrown into prison like that, brutally, and without any
      reflection. If I had anticipated that, I should have let the captain of
      the guards undertake it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so&mdash;?&rdquo; said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, I repeat again, we will go wherever you may choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Athos, embracing D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;how like you that
      is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seems simple enough to me. The coachman will take you to the
      barrier of the Cours-la-Reine; you will find a horse there which I have
      ordered to be kept ready for you; with that horse you will be able to do
      three posts without stopping; and I, on my side, will take care not to
      return to the king, to tell him that you have gone away, until the very
      moment it will be impossible to overtake you. In the meantime you will
      have reached Le Havre, and from Le Havre across to England, where you will
      find the charming residence of which M. Monk made me a present, without
      speaking of the hospitality which King Charles will not fail to show you.
      Well, what do you think of this project?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos shook his head, and then said, smiling as he did so, &ldquo;No, no, take
      me to the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an obstinate fellow, my dear Athos,&rdquo; returned D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      &ldquo;reflect for a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are no longer twenty years of age. Believe me, I speak according
      to my own knowledge and experience. A prison is certain death for men who
      are at our time of life. No, no; I will never allow you to languish in
      prison in such a way. Why, the very thought of it makes my head turn
      giddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear D&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; Athos replied, &ldquo;Heaven most fortunately made my body as
      strong, powerful, and enduring as my mind; and, rely upon it, I shall
      retain my strength up to the very last moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is not strength of mind or character; it is sheer madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, D&rsquo;Artagnan, it is the highest order of reasoning. Do not suppose that
      I should in the slightest degree in the world discuss the question with
      you, whether you would not be ruined in endeavoring to save me. I should
      have done precisely as you propose if flight had been part of my plan of
      action; I should, therefore, have accepted from you what, without any
      doubt, you would have accepted from me. No! I know you too well even to
      breathe a word upon the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if you would only let me do it,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;what a dance we
      would give his most gracious majesty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still he is the king; do not forget that, my dear friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is all the same to me; and king though he be, I would plainly
      tell him, &lsquo;Sire, imprison, exile, kill every one in France and Europe;
      order me to arrest and poniard even whom you like&mdash;even were it
      Monsieur, your own brother; but do not touch one of the four musketeers,
      or if so, <i>mordioux!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; replied Athos, with perfect calmness, &ldquo;I should like to
      persuade you of one thing; namely, that I wish to be arrested; that I
      desire above all things that my arrest should take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan made a slight movement of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I wish it, I repeat, more than anything; if you were to let me
      escape, it would be only to return of my own accord, and constitute myself
      a prisoner. I wish to prove to this young man, who is dazzled by the power
      and splendor of his crown, that he can be regarded as the first and
      chiefest among men only on the one condition of his proving himself to be
      the most generous and the wisest. He may punish me, imprison, torture me,
      it matters not. He abuses his opportunities, and I wish him to learn the
      bitterness of remorse, while Heaven teaches him what chastisement is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I know only too well that, when you
      have once said, &lsquo;no,&rsquo; you mean &lsquo;no.&rsquo; I do not insist any longer; you wish
      to go to the Bastile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish to go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go, then! To the Bastile!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Artagnan to the coachman. And
      throwing himself back in the carriage, he gnawed the ends of his mustache
      with a fury which, for Athos, who knew him well, signified a resolution
      either already taken or in course of formation. A profound silence ensued
      in the carriage, which continued to roll on, but neither faster nor slower
      than before. Athos took the musketeer by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not angry with me, D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&mdash;oh, no! certainly not; of course not. What you do for heroism, I
      should have done from obstinacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are quite of opinion, are you not, that Heaven will avenge me,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know one or two on earth who will not fail to lend a helping hand,&rdquo;
       said the captain.

    <h2>
      Chapter LXIII. Three Guests Astonished to Find Themselves at Supper
      Together.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The carriage arrived at the outside of the gate of the Bastile. A soldier
      on guard stopped it, but D&rsquo;Artagnan had only to utter a single word to
      procure admittance, and the carriage passed on without further difficulty.
      Whilst they were proceeding along the covered way which led to the
      courtyard of the governor&rsquo;s residence, D&rsquo;Artagnan, whose lynx eyes saw
      everything, even through the walls, suddenly cried out, &ldquo;What is that out
      yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Athos, quietly; &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look yonder, Athos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the courtyard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; make haste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a carriage; very likely conveying a prisoner like myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be too droll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste and look again, and look at the man who is just getting out of
      that carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that very moment a second sentinel stopped D&rsquo;Artagnan, and while the
      formalities were being gone through, Athos could see at a hundred paces
      from him the man whom his friend had pointed out to him. He was, in fact,
      getting out of the carriage at the door of the governor&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       inquired D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;do you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is a man in a gray suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot very well tell; he is, as I have just now told you, a man in a
      gray suit, who is getting out of a carriage; that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Athos, I will wager anything that it is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aramis arrested? Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say he is arrested, since we see him alone in his carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, what is he doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he knows Baisemeaux, the governor,&rdquo; replied the musketeer, slyly; &ldquo;so
      we have arrived just in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to see what we can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret this meeting exceedingly. When Aramis sees me, he will be very
      much annoyed, in the first place, at seeing me, and in the next at being
      seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well reasoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, there is no remedy for it; whenever any one meets another
      in the Bastile, even if he wished to draw back to avoid him, it would be
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Athos, I have an idea; the question is, to spare Aramis the annoyance you
      were speaking of, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you; or in order to explain myself in the best possible way,
      let me relate the affair in my own manner; I will not recommend you to
      tell a falsehood, for that would be impossible for you to do; but I will
      tell falsehoods enough for both; it is easy to do that when one is born to
      the nature and habits of a Gascon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos smiled. The carriage stopped where the one we have just now pointed
      out had stopped; namely, at the door of the governor&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;It is
      understood, then?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, in a low voice to his friend. Athos
      consented by a gesture. They ascended the staircase. There will be no
      occasion for surprise at the facility with which they had entered into the
      Bastile, if it be remembered that, before passing the first gate, in fact,
      the most difficult of all, D&rsquo;Artagnan had announced that he had brought a
      prisoner of state. At the third gate, on the contrary, that is to say,
      when he had once fairly entered the prison, he merely said to the
      sentinel, &ldquo;To M. Baisemeaux;&rdquo; and they both passed on. In a few minutes
      they were in the governor&rsquo;s dining-room, and the first face which
      attracted D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s observation was that of Aramis, who was seated side
      by side with Baisemeaux, awaiting the announcement of a meal whose odor
      impregnated the whole apartment. If D&rsquo;Artagnan pretended surprise, Aramis
      did not pretend at all; he started when he saw his two friends, and his
      emotion was very apparent. Athos and D&rsquo;Artagnan, however, complimented him
      as usual, and Baisemeaux, amazed, completely stupefied by the presence of
      his three guests, began to perform a few evolutions around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what lucky accident&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just going to ask you,&rdquo; retorted D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we going to give ourselves up as prisoners?&rdquo; cried Aramis, with an
      affection of hilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;it is true the walls smell deucedly like a
      prison. Monsieur de Baisemeaux, you know you invited me to sup with you
      the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course you did, although you now seem so struck with amazement.
      Don&rsquo;t you remember it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux turned pale and then red, looked at Aramis, who looked at him,
      and finished by stammering out, &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;I am delighted&mdash;but,
      upon my honor&mdash;I have not the slightest&mdash;Ah! I have such a
      wretched memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I am wrong, I see,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, as if he were offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, what for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong to remember anything about it, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux hurried towards him. &ldquo;Do not stand on ceremony, my dear
      captain,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have the worst memory in the world. I no sooner
      leave off thinking of my pigeons and their pigeon-house, than I am no
      better than the rawest recruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, you remember it now,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied the governor, hesitating; &ldquo;I think I do remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was when you came to the palace to see me; you told me some story or
      other about your accounts with M. de Louviere and M. de Tremblay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about M. d&rsquo;Herblay&rsquo;s kindness towards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Aramis, looking at the unhappy governor full in the face,
      &ldquo;and yet you just now said you had no memory, Monsieur de Baisemeaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux interrupted the musketeer in the middle of his revelations.
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; you&rsquo;re quite right; how could I have forgotten; I remember it
      now as well as possible; I beg you a thousand pardons. But now, once for
      all, my dear M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, be sure that at this present time, as at any
      other, whether invited or not, you are perfectly at home here, you and M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay, your friend,&rdquo; he said, turning towards Aramis; &ldquo;and this
      gentleman, too,&rdquo; he added, bowing to Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought it would be sure to turn out so,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      &ldquo;and that is the reason I came. Having nothing to do this evening at the
      Palais Royal, I wished to judge for myself what your ordinary style of
      living was like; and as I was coming along, I met the Comte de la Fere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athos bowed. &ldquo;The comte, who had just left his majesty, handed me an order
      which required immediate attention. We were close by here; I wished to
      call in, even if it were for no other object than that of shaking hands
      with you and of presenting the comte to you, of whom you spoke so highly
      that evening at the palace when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly&mdash;M. le Comte de la Fere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The comte is welcome, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will sup with you two, I suppose, whilst I, unfortunate dog that I
      am, must run off on a matter of duty. Oh! what happy beings you are,
      compared to myself,&rdquo; he added, sighing as loud as Porthos might have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you are going away, then?&rdquo; said Aramis and Baisemeaux together,
      with the same expression of delighted surprise, the tone of which was
      immediately noticed by D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you in my place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a noble and excellent guest.&rdquo; And he
      touched Athos gently on the shoulder, who, astonished also, could not help
      exhibiting his surprise a little; which was noticed by Aramis only, for M.
      de Baisemeaux was not quite equal to the three friends in point of
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, are you going to leave us?&rdquo; resumed the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall only be about an hour, or an hour and a half. I will return in
      time for dessert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we will wait for you,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; that would be really disobliging me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be sure to return, though?&rdquo; said Athos, with an expression of
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; he said, pressing his friend&rsquo;s hand confidently; and he
      added, in a low voice, &ldquo;Wait for me, Athos; be cheerful and lively as
      possible, and above all, don&rsquo;t allude even to business affairs, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a renewed pressure of the hand, he seemed to warn the comte of
      the necessity of keeping perfectly discreet and impenetrable. Baisemeaux
      led D&rsquo;Artagnan to the gate. Aramis, with many friendly protestations of
      delight, sat down by Athos, determined to make him speak; but Athos
      possessed every virtue and quality to the very highest degree. If
      necessity had required it, he would have been the finest orator in the
      world, but on other occasions he would rather have died than have opened
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes after D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s departure, the three gentlemen sat down to
      table, which was covered with the most substantial display of gastronomic
      luxury. Large joints, exquisite dishes, preserves, the greatest variety of
      wines, appeared successively upon the table, which was served at the
      king&rsquo;s expense, and of which expense M. Colbert would have found no
      difficulty in saving two thirds, without any one in the Bastile being the
      worse for it. Baisemeaux was the only one who ate and drank with
      gastronomic resolution. Aramis allowed nothing to pass by him, but merely
      touched everything he took; Athos, after the soup and three <i>hors
      d&rsquo;oeuvres</i>, ate nothing more. The style of conversation was such as
      might have been anticipated between three men so opposite in temper and
      ideas. Aramis was incessantly asking himself by what extraordinary chance
      Athos was there at Baisemeaux&rsquo;s when D&rsquo;Artagnan was no longer there, and
      why D&rsquo;Artagnan did not remain when Athos was there. Athos sounded all the
      depths of the mind of Aramis, who lived in the midst of subterfuge,
      evasion, and intrigue; he studied his man well and thoroughly, and felt
      convinced that he was engaged upon some important project. And then he too
      began to think of his own personal affair, and to lose himself in
      conjectures as to D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s reason for having left the Bastile so
      abruptly, and for leaving behind him a prisoner so badly introduced and so
      badly looked after by the prison authorities. But we shall not pause to
      examine into the thoughts and feelings of these personages, but will leave
      them to themselves, surrounded by the remains of poultry, game, and fish,
      which Baisemeaux&rsquo;s generous knife and fork had so mutilated. We are going
      to follow D&rsquo;Artagnan instead, who, getting into the carriage which had
      brought him, said to the coachman, &ldquo;Return to the palace, as fast as the
      horses can gallop.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter LXIV. What Took Place at the Louvre During the Supper at the
      Bastile.
    </h2>
    <p>
      M. de Saint-Aignan had executed the commission with which the king had
      intrusted him for La Valliere&mdash;as we have already seen in one of the
      preceding chapters; but, whatever his eloquence, he did not succeed in
      persuading the young girl that she had in the king a protector powerful
      enough for her under any combination of circumstances, and that she had no
      need of any one else in the world when the king was on her side. In point
      of fact, at the very first word which the favorite mentioned of the
      discovery of the famous secret, Louise, in a passion of tears, abandoned
      herself in utter despair to a sorrow which would have been far from
      flattering for the king, if he had been a witness of it from one of the
      corners of the room. Saint-Aignan, in his character of ambassador, felt
      almost as greatly offended at it as his master himself would have been,
      and returned to inform the king what he had seen and heard; and it is thus
      we find him, in a state of great agitation, in the presence of the king,
      who was, if possible, in a state of even greater flurry than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the king to the courtier, when the latter had finished his
      report, &ldquo;what did she decide to do? Shall I at least see her presently
      before supper? Will she come to me, or shall I be obliged to go to her
      room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, sire, that if your majesty wishes to see her, you will not
      only have to take the first step in advance, but will have to go the whole
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I do not mind. Do you think she has yet a secret fancy for young
      Bragelonne?&rdquo; muttered the king between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire, that is not possible; for it is you alone, I am convinced,
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere loves, and that, too, with all her heart. But
      you know that De Bragelonne belongs to that proud race who play the part
      of Roman heroes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled feebly; he knew how true the illustration was, for Athos
      had just left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Mademoiselle de la Valliere,&rdquo; Saint-Aignan continued, &ldquo;she was
      brought up under the care of the Dowager Madame, that is to say, in the
      greatest austerity and formality. This young engaged couple coldly
      exchanged their little vows in the prim presence of the moon and stars;
      and now, when they find they have to break those vows asunder, it plays
      the very deuce with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan thought to have made the king laugh; but on the contrary,
      from a mere smile Louis passed to the greatest seriousness of manner. He
      already began to experience that remorse which the comte had promised
      D&rsquo;Artagnan he would inflict upon him. He reflected that, in fact, these
      young persons had loved and sworn fidelity to each other; that one of the
      two had kept his word, and that the other was too conscientious not to
      feel her perjury most bitterly. And his remorse was not unaccompanied; for
      bitter pangs of jealousy began to beset the king&rsquo;s heart. He did not say
      another word, and instead of going to pay a visit to his mother, or the
      queen, or Madame, in order to amuse himself a little, and make the ladies
      laugh, as he himself used to say, he threw himself into the huge armchair
      in which his august father Louis XIII. had passed so many weary days and
      years in company with Barradat and Cinq-Mars. Saint-Aignan perceived the
      king was not to be amused at that moment; he tried a last resource, and
      pronounced Louise&rsquo;s name, which made the king look up immediately. &ldquo;What
      does your majesty intend to do this evening&mdash;shall Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere be informed of your intention to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems she is already aware of that,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;No, no,
      Saint-Aignan,&rdquo; he continued, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;we will both of us
      pass our time in thinking, and musing, and dreaming; when Mademoiselle de
      la Valliere shall have sufficiently regretted what she now regrets, she
      will deign, perhaps, to give us some news of herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! sire, is it possible you can so misunderstand her heart, which is so
      full of devotion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king rose, flushed from vexation and annoyance; he was a prey to
      jealousy as well as to remorse. Saint-Aignan was just beginning to feel
      that his position was becoming awkward, when the curtain before the door
      was raised. The king turned hastily round; his first idea was that a
      letter from Louise had arrived; but, instead of a letter of love, he only
      saw his captain of musketeers, standing upright, and perfectly silent in
      the doorway. &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ah! Well, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan looked at Saint-Aignan; the king&rsquo;s eyes took the same direction
      as those of his captain; these looks would have been clear to any one, and
      for a still greater reason they were so for Saint-Aignan. The courtier
      bowed and quitted the room, leaving the king and D&rsquo;Artagnan alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it done?&rdquo; inquired the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; replied the captain of the musketeers, in a grave voice, &ldquo;it
      is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was unable to say another word. Pride, however, obliged him not
      to pause at what he had done; whenever a sovereign has adopted a decisive
      course, even though it be unjust, he is compelled to prove to all
      witnesses, and particularly to prove it to himself, that he was quite
      right all through. A good means for effecting that&mdash;an almost
      infallible means, indeed&mdash;is, to try and prove his victim to be in
      the wrong. Louis, brought up by Mazarin and Anne of Austria, knew better
      than any one else his vocation as a monarch; he therefore endeavored to
      prove it on the present occasion. After a few moment&rsquo;s pause, which he had
      employed in making silently to himself the same reflections which we have
      just expressed aloud, he said, in an indifferent tone: &ldquo;What did the comte
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely he did not allow himself to be arrested without saying something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he expected to be arrested, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king raised his head haughtily. &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that M. le
      Comte de la Fere has not continued to play his obstinate and rebellious
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, sire, what do you wish to signify by <i>rebellious?</i>&rdquo;
       quietly asked the musketeer. &ldquo;A rebel, in the eyes of the king, is a man
      who not only allows himself to be shut up in the Bastile, but still more,
      who opposes those who do not wish to take him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do not wish to take him there!&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;What do you say,
      captain! Are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of persons who did not wish to arrest M. de la Fere! Who are
      those persons, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say those whom your majesty intrusted with that duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was you whom I intrusted with it,&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire; it was I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you say that, despite my orders, you had the intention of not
      arresting the man who had insulted me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire&mdash;that was really my intention. I even proposed to the
      comte to mount a horse that I had prepared for him at the Barriere de la
      Conference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was your object in getting this horse ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sire, in order that M. le Comte de la Fere might be able to reach Le
      Havre, and from that place make his escape to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You betrayed me, then, monsieur?&rdquo; cried the king, kindling with a wild
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to say in answer to statements made in such a tone; the
      king was astounded at such an obstinate and open resistance on the part of
      D&rsquo;Artagnan. &ldquo;At least you had a reason, Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, for acting as
      you did?&rdquo; said the king, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always a reason for everything, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reason cannot be your friendship for the comte, at all events,&mdash;the
      only one that can be of any avail, the only one that could possibly excuse
      you,&mdash;for I placed you perfectly at your ease in that respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not give you the choice to arrest, or not to arrest M. le Comte de
      la Fere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; exclaimed the king, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you warned me, sire, that if I did not arrest him, your captain of
      the guard should do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not considerate enough towards you, from the very moment I did not
      compel you to obey me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me, sire, you were, but not to my friend, for my friend would be
      arrested all the same, whether by myself or by the captain of the guards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is your devotion, monsieur! a devotion which argues and reasons.
      You are no soldier, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wait for your majesty to tell me what I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;you are a Frondeur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And since there is no longer any Fronde, sire, in that case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if what you say is true&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say is always true, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you come to say to me, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to say to your majesty, &lsquo;Sire, M. de la Fere is in the
      Bastile.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not your fault, it would seem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, sire; but at all events he is there; and since he is there,
      it is important that your majesty should know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan, so you set your king at defiance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Artagnan! I warn you that you are abusing my patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;on the contrary&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to get myself arrested, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get yourself arrested,&mdash;you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. My friend will get wearied to death in the Bastile by himself;
      and I have come to propose to your majesty to permit me to bear him
      company; if your majesty will but give me the word, I will arrest myself;
      I shall not need the captain of the guards for that, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king darted towards the table and seized hold of a pen to write the
      order for D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s imprisonment. &ldquo;Pay attention, monsieur, that this
      is forever,&rdquo; cried the king, in tones of sternest menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can quite believe that,&rdquo; returned the musketeer; &ldquo;for when you have
      once done such an act as that, you will never be able to look me in the
      face again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king dashed down his pen violently. &ldquo;Leave the room, monsieur!&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, if it please your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I came to speak gently and temperately to your majesty; your
      majesty got into a passion with me; that is a misfortune; but I shall not
      the less on that account say what I had to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your resignation, monsieur,&mdash;your resignation!&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, you know whether I care about my resignation or not, since at
      Blois, on the very day when you refused King Charles the million which my
      friend the Comte de la Fere gave him, I then tendered my resignation to
      your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, monsieur&mdash;do it at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire; for there is no question of my resignation at the present
      moment. Your majesty took up your pen just now to send me to the Bastile,&mdash;why
      should you change your intention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Artagnan! Gascon that you are! who is king, allow me to ask,&mdash;you
      or myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, sire, unfortunately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;unfortunately&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire; for if it were I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were you, you would approve of M. d&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s rebellious conduct,
      I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said the king, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I should tell my captain of the musketeers,&rdquo; continued D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;I
      should tell him, looking at him all the while with human eyes, and not
      with eyes like coals of fire, &lsquo;M. d&rsquo;Artagnan, I had forgotten that I was
      the king, for I descended from my throne in order to insult a gentleman.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;do you think you can excuse your friend by
      exceeding him in insolence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sire! I should go much further than he did,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;and it
      would be your own fault. I should tell you what he, a man full of the
      finest sense of delicacy, did not tell you; I should say&mdash;&lsquo;Sire, you
      have sacrificed his son, and he defended his son&mdash;you sacrificed
      himself; he addressed you in the name of honor, of religion, of virtue&mdash;you
      repulsed, drove him away, imprisoned him.&rsquo; I should be harder than he was,
      for I should say to you&mdash;&lsquo;Sire; it is for you to choose. Do you wish
      to have friends or lackeys&mdash;soldiers or slaves&mdash;great men or
      mere puppets? Do you wish men to serve you, or to bend and crouch before
      you? Do you wish men to love you, or to be afraid of you? If you prefer
      baseness, intrigue, cowardice, say so at once, sire, and we will leave
      you,&mdash;we who are the only individuals who are left,&mdash;nay, I will
      say more, the only models of the valor of former times; we who have done
      our duty, and have exceeded, perhaps, in courage and in merit, the men
      already great for posterity. Choose, sire! and that, too, without delay.
      Whatever relics remain to you of the great nobility, guard them with a
      jealous eye; you will never be deficient in courtiers. Delay not&mdash;and
      send me to the Bastile with my friend; for, if you did not know how to
      listen to the Comte de la Fere, whose voice is the sweetest and noblest in
      all the world when honor is the theme; if you do not know how to listen to
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, the frankest and honestest voice of sincerity, you are a bad
      king, and to-morrow will be a poor king. And learn from me, sire, that bad
      kings are hated by their people, and poor kings are driven ignominiously
      away.&rsquo; That is what I had to say to you, sire; you were wrong to drive me
      to say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king threw himself back in his chair, cold as death, and as livid as a
      corpse. Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet, he could not have been more
      astonished; he seemed as if his respiration had utterly ceased, and that
      he was at the point of death. The honest voice of sincerity, as D&rsquo;Artagnan
      had called it, had pierced through his heart like a sword-blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had said all he had to say. Comprehending the king&rsquo;s anger, he
      drew his sword, and, approaching Louis XIV. respectfully, he placed it on
      the table. But the king, with a furious gesture, thrust aside the sword,
      which fell on the ground and rolled to D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s feet. Notwithstanding
      the perfect mastery which D&rsquo;Artagnan exercised over himself, he, too, in
      his turn, became pale, and, trembling with indignation, said: &ldquo;A king may
      disgrace a soldier,&mdash;he may exile him, and may even condemn him to
      death; but were he a hundred times a king, he has no right to insult him
      by casting a dishonor upon his sword! Sire, a king of France has never
      repulsed with contempt the sword of a man such as I am! Stained with
      disgrace as this sword now is, it has henceforth no other sheath than
      either your heart or my own! I choose my own, sire; and you have to thank
      Heaven and my own patience that I do so.&rdquo; Then snatching up his sword, he
      cried, &ldquo;My blood be upon your head!&rdquo; and, with a rapid gesture, he placed
      the hilt upon the floor and directed the point of the blade towards his
      breast. The king, however, with a movement far more rapid than that of
      D&rsquo;Artagnan, threw his right arm around the musketeer&rsquo;s neck, and with his
      left hand seized hold of the blade by the middle, and returned it silently
      to the scabbard. D&rsquo;Artagnan, upright, pale, and still trembling, let the
      king do all to the very end. Louis, overcome and softened by gentler
      feelings, returned to the table, took a pen in his hand, wrote a few
      lines, signed them, and then held it out to D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this paper, sire?&rdquo; inquired the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An order for M. d&rsquo;Artagnan to set the Comte de la Fere at liberty
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan seized the king&rsquo;s hand, and imprinted a kiss upon it; he then
      folded the order, placed it in his belt, and quitted the room. Neither the
      king nor the captain had uttered a syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, human heart! thou guide and director of kings,&rdquo; murmured Louis, when
      alone, &ldquo;when shall I learn to read in your inmost recesses, as in the
      leaves of a book! Oh, I am not a bad king&mdash;nor am I a poor king; I am
      but still a child, when all is said and done.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter LXV. Political Rivals.
    </h2>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had promised M. de Baisemeaux to return in time for dessert,
      and he kept his word. They had just reached the finer and more delicate
      class of wines and liqueurs with which the governor&rsquo;s cellar had the
      reputation of being most admirably stocked, when the silver spurs of the
      captain resounded in the corridor, and he himself appeared at the
      threshold. Athos and Aramis had played a close game; neither of the two
      had been able to gain the slightest advantage over the other. They had
      supped, talked a good deal about the Bastile, of the last journey to
      Fontainebleau, of the intended <i>fete</i> that M. Fouquet was about to
      give at Vaux; they had generalized on every possible subject; and no one,
      excepting Baisemeaux, had in the slightest degree alluded to private
      matters. D&rsquo;Artagnan arrived in the very midst of the conversation, still
      pale and much disturbed by his interview with the king. Baisemeaux
      hastened to give him a chair; D&rsquo;Artagnan accepted a glass of wine, and set
      it down empty. Athos and Aramis both remarked his emotion; as for
      Baisemeaux, he saw nothing more than the captain of the king&rsquo;s musketeers,
      to whom he endeavored to show every possible attention. But, although
      Aramis had remarked his emotion, he had not been able to guess the cause
      of it. Athos alone believed he had detected it. For him, D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s
      return, and particularly the manner in which he, usually so impassible,
      seemed overcome, signified, &ldquo;I have just asked the king something which
      the king has refused me.&rdquo; Thoroughly convinced that his conjecture was
      correct, Athos smiled, rose from the table, and made a sign to D&rsquo;Artagnan,
      as if to remind him that they had something else to do than to sup
      together. D&rsquo;Artagnan immediately understood him, and replied by another
      sign. Aramis and Baisemeaux watched this silent dialogue, and looked
      inquiringly at each other. Athos felt that he was called upon to give an
      explanation of what was passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, my friend,&rdquo; said the Comte de la Fere, with a smile, &ldquo;that
      you, Aramis, have been supping with a state criminal, and you, Monsieur de
      Baisemeaux, with your prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux uttered an exclamation of surprise, and almost of delight; for
      he was exceedingly proud and vain of his fortress, and for his own
      individual profit, the more prisoners he had, the happier he was, and the
      higher in rank the prisoners happened to be, the prouder he felt. Aramis
      assumed the expression of countenance he thought the position justified,
      and said, &ldquo;Well, dear Athos, forgive me, but I almost suspected what has
      happened. Some prank of Raoul and La Valliere, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Aramis, &ldquo;you, a high and powerful nobleman as you are,
      forgetful that courtiers now exist&mdash;you have been to the king, I
      suppose, and told him what you thought of his conduct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have guessed right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux, trembling at having supped so familiarly with
      a man who had fallen into disgrace with the king; &ldquo;so that, monsieur le
      comte&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that, my dear governor,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;my friend D&rsquo;Artagnan will
      communicate to you the contents of the paper which I perceived just
      peeping out of his belt, and which assuredly can be nothing else than the
      order for my incarceration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux held out his hand with his accustomed eagerness. D&rsquo;Artagnan
      drew two papers from his belt, and presented one of them to the governor,
      who unfolded it, and then read, in a low tone of voice, looking at Athos
      over the paper, as he did so, and pausing from time to time: &ldquo;&lsquo;Order to
      detain, in my chateau of the Bastile, Monsieur le Comte de la Fere.&rsquo; Oh,
      monsieur! this is indeed a very melancholy day for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have a patient prisoner, monsieur,&rdquo; said Athos, in his calm,
      soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prisoner, too, who will not remain a month with you, my dear governor,&rdquo;
       said Aramis; while Baisemeaux, still holding the order in his hand,
      transcribed it upon the prison registry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a day, or rather not even a night,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, displaying the
      second order of the king, &ldquo;for now, dear M. de Baisemeaux, you will have
      the goodness to transcribe also this order for setting the comte
      immediately at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;it is a labor that you have deprived me of,
      D&rsquo;Artagnan;&rdquo; and he pressed the musketeer&rsquo;s hand in a significant manner,
      at the same moment as that of Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the latter in astonishment, &ldquo;the king sets me at liberty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read, my dear friend,&rdquo; returned D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos took the order and read it. &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sorry for it?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, on the contrary. I wish the king no harm; and the greatest evil
      or misfortune that any one can wish kings, is that they should commit an
      act of injustice. But you have had a difficult and painful task, I know.
      Tell me, have you not, D&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? not at all,&rdquo; said the musketeer, laughing: &ldquo;the king does everything I
      wish him to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked fixedly at D&rsquo;Artagnan, and saw that he was not speaking the
      truth. But Baisemeaux had eyes for nothing but D&rsquo;Artagnan, so great was
      his admiration for a man who seemed to make the king do all he wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does the king exile Athos?&rdquo; inquired Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not precisely; the king did not explain himself upon that subject,&rdquo;
       replied D&rsquo;Artagnan; &ldquo;but I think the comte could not well do better
      unless, indeed, he wishes particularly to thank the king&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied Athos, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I think,&rdquo; resumed D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;that the comte cannot do
      better than to retire to his <i>own</i> chateau. However, my dear Athos,
      you have only to speak, to tell me what you want. If any particular place
      of residence is more agreeable to you than another, I am influential
      enough, perhaps, to obtain it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Athos; &ldquo;nothing can be more agreeable to me, my dear
      friend, than to return to my solitude beneath my noble trees on the banks
      of the Loire. If Heaven be the overruling physician of the evils of the
      mind, nature is a sovereign remedy. And so, monsieur,&rdquo; continued Athos,
      turning again towards Baisemeaux, &ldquo;I am now free, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur le comte, I think so&mdash;at least, I hope so,&rdquo; said the
      governor, turning over and over the two papers in question, &ldquo;unless,
      however, M. d&rsquo;Artagnan has a third order to give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Baisemeaux, no,&rdquo; said the musketeer; &ldquo;the second is quite
      enough: we will stop there&mdash;if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur le comte,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux addressing Athos, &ldquo;you do not
      know what you are losing. I should have placed you among the thirty-franc
      prisoners, like the generals&mdash;what am I saying?&mdash;I mean among
      the fifty-francs, like the princes, and you would have supped every
      evening as you have done to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me, monsieur,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;to prefer my own simpler fare.&rdquo; And
      then, turning to D&rsquo;Artagnan, he said, &ldquo;Let us go, my dear friend. Shall I
      have that greatest of all pleasures for me&mdash;that of having you as my
      companion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the city gate only,&rdquo; replied D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;after which I will tell you
      what I told the king: &lsquo;I am on duty.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my dear Aramis,&rdquo; said Athos, smiling; &ldquo;will you accompany me? La
      Fere is on the road to Vannes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Aramis, &ldquo;but I have an appointment in
      Paris this evening, and I cannot leave without very serious interests
      suffering by my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Athos, &ldquo;I must say adieu, and take my leave of you.
      My dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux, I have to thank you exceedingly for your
      kind and friendly disposition towards me, and particularly for the
      enjoyable specimen you have given me of the ordinary fare of the Bastile.&rdquo;
       And, having embraced Aramis, and shaken hands with M. de Baisemeaux, and
      having received best wishes for a pleasant journey from them both, Athos
      set off with D&rsquo;Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the <i>denouement</i> of the scene of the Palais Royal was taking
      place at the Bastile, let us relate what was going on at the lodgings of
      Athos and Bragelonne. Grimaud, as we have seen, had accompanied his master
      to Paris; and, as we have said, he was present when Athos went out; he had
      observed D&rsquo;Artagnan gnaw the corners of his mustache; he had seen his
      master get into the carriage; he had narrowly examined both their
      countenances, and he had known them both for a sufficiently long period to
      read and understand, through the mask of their impassibility, that
      something serious was the matter. As soon as Athos had gone, he began to
      reflect; he then, and then only, remembered the strange manner in which
      Athos had taken leave of him, the embarrassment&mdash;imperceptible as it
      would have been to any but himself&mdash;of the master whose ideas were,
      to him, so clear and defined, and the expression of whose wishes was so
      precise. He knew that Athos had taken nothing with him but the clothes he
      had on him at the time; and yet he seemed to fancy that Athos had not left
      for an hour merely; or even for a day. A long absence was signified by the
      manner in which he pronounced the word &ldquo;Adieu.&rdquo; All these circumstances
      recurred to his mind, with feelings of deep affection for Athos, with that
      horror of isolation and solitude which invariably besets the minds of
      those who love; and all these combined rendered poor Grimaud very
      melancholy, and particularly uneasy. Without being able to account to
      himself for what he did since his master&rsquo;s departure, he wandered about
      the room, seeking, as it were, for some traces of him, like a faithful
      dog, who is not exactly uneasy about his absent master, but at least is
      restless. Only as, in addition to the instinct of the animal, Grimaud
      subjoined the reasoning faculties of the man, Grimaud therefore felt
      uneasy and restless too. Not having found any indication which could serve
      as a guide, and having neither seen nor discovered anything which could
      satisfy his doubts, Grimaud began to wonder what could possibly have
      happened. Besides, imagination is the resource, or rather the plague of
      gentle and affectionate hearts. In fact, never does a feeling heart
      represent its absent friend to itself as being happy or cheerful. Never
      does the dove that wings its flight in search of adventures inspire
      anything but terror at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimaud soon passed from uneasiness to terror; he carefully went over, in
      his own mind, everything that had taken place: D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s letter to
      Athos, the letter which had seemed to distress Athos so much after he had
      read it; then Raoul&rsquo;s visit to Athos, which resulted in Athos desiring him
      (Grimaud) to get his various orders and his court dress ready to put on;
      then his interview with the king, at the end of which Athos had returned
      home so unusually gloomy; then the explanation between the father and the
      son, at the termination of which Athos had embraced Raoul with such
      sadness of expression, while Raoul himself went away equally weary and
      melancholy; and finally, D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s arrival, biting, as if he were
      vexed, the end of his mustache, and leaving again in the carriage,
      accompanied by the Comte de la Fere. All this composed a drama in five
      acts very clearly, particularly for so analytical an observer as Grimaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step he took was to search in his master&rsquo;s coat for M.
      d&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s letter; he found the letter still there, and its contents
      were found to run as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;Raoul has been to ask me for some particulars about
      the conduct of Mademoiselle de la Valliere, during our young friend&rsquo;s
      residence in London. I am a poor captain of musketeers, and I am sickened
      to death every day by hearing all the scandal of the barracks and bedside
      conversations. If I had told Raoul all I believe, I know the poor fellow
      would have died of it; but I am in the king&rsquo;s service, and cannot relate
      all I hear about the king&rsquo;s affairs. If your heart tells you to do it, set
      off at once; the matter concerns you more than it does myself, and almost
      as much as Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grimaud tore, not a handful, but a finger-and-thumbful of hair out of his
      head; he would have done more if his head of hair had been in a more
      flourishing condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is the key of the whole enigma. The young girl has
      been playing her pranks; what people say about her and the king is true,
      then; our young master has been deceived; he ought to know it. Monsieur le
      comte has been to see the king, and has told him a piece of his mind; and
      then the king sent M. d&rsquo;Artagnan to arrange the affair. Ah! gracious
      goodness!&rdquo; continued Grimaud, &ldquo;monsieur le comte, I now remember, returned
      without his sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This discovery made the perspiration break out all over poor Grimaud&rsquo;s
      face. He did not waste any more time in useless conjecture, but clapped
      his hat on his head, and ran to Raoul&rsquo;s lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, after Louise had left him, had mastered his grief, if not his
      affection; and, compelled to look forward on that perilous road over which
      madness and revulsion were hurrying him, he had seen, from the very first
      glance, his father exposed to the royal obstinacy, since Athos had himself
      been the first to oppose any resistance to the royal will. At this moment,
      from a very natural sequence of feeling, the unhappy young man remembered
      the mysterious signs which Athos had made, and the unexpected visit of
      D&rsquo;Artagnan; the result of the conflict between a sovereign and a subject
      revealed itself to his terrified vision. As D&rsquo;Artagnan was on duty, that
      is, a fixture at his post without the possibility of leaving it, it was
      certainly not likely that he had come to pay Athos a visit merely for the
      pleasure of seeing him. He must have come to say something to him. This
      something in the midst of such painful conjectures must have been the news
      of either a misfortune or a danger. Raoul trembled at having been so
      selfish as to have forgotten his father for his affection; at having, in a
      word, passed his time in idle dreams, or in an indulgence of despair, at a
      time when a necessity existed for repelling such an imminent attack on
      Athos. The very idea nearly drove him frantic; he buckled on his sword and
      ran towards his father&rsquo;s lodgings. On his way there he encountered
      Grimaud, who, having set off from the opposite pole, was running with
      equal eagerness in search of the truth. The two men embraced each other
      most warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grimaud,&rdquo; exclaimed Raoul, &ldquo;is the comte well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went out with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes after you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way did they go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did my father take any money with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or his sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an idea, Grimaud, that M. d&rsquo;Artagnan came in order to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest monsieur le comte, do you not think, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Grimaud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have sworn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What road did they take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way leading towards the quay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Bastile, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, quick; let us run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let us not lose a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are we to go?&rdquo; said Raoul, overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go to M. d&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s first, we may perhaps learn something
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; if they keep me in ignorance at my father&rsquo;s, they will do the same
      everywhere. Let us go to&mdash;Oh, good heavens! why, I must be mad
      to-day, Grimaud; I have forgotten M. du Vallon, who is waiting for and
      expecting me still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Minimes of Vincennes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness, that is on the same side as the Bastile. I will run and
      saddle the horses, and we will go at once,&rdquo; said Grimaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, my friend, do.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter LXVI. In Which Porthos Is Convinced without Having Understood
      Anything.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The good and worthy Porthos, faithful to all the laws of ancient chivalry,
      had determined to wait for M. de Saint-Aignan until sunset; and as
      Saint-Aignan did not come, as Raoul had forgotten to communicate with his
      second, and as he found that waiting so long was very wearisome, Porthos
      had desired one of the gate-keepers to fetch him a few bottles of good
      wine and a good joint of meat,&mdash;so that, at least, he might pass away
      the time by means of a glass or two and a mouthful of something to eat. He
      had just finished when Raoul arrived, escorted by Grimaud, both of them
      riding at full speed. As soon as Porthos saw the two cavaliers riding at
      such a pace along the road, he did not for a moment doubt but that they
      were the men he was expecting, and he rose from the grass upon which he
      had been indolently reclining and began to stretch his legs and arms,
      saying, &ldquo;See what it is to have good habits. The fellow has finished by
      coming, after all. If I had gone away he would have found no one here and
      would have taken advantage of that.&rdquo; He then threw himself into a martial
      attitude, and drew himself up to the full height of his gigantic stature.
      But instead of Saint-Aignan, he only saw Raoul, who, with the most
      despairing gestures, accosted him by crying out, &ldquo;Pray forgive me, my dear
      friend, I am most wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raoul!&rdquo; cried Porthos, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been angry with me?&rdquo; said Raoul, embracing Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For having forgotten you. But I assure you my head seems utterly lost. If
      you only knew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have killed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint-Aignan; or, if that is not the case, what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is, that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere has by this time been
      arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos gave a start that would have thrown down a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrested!&rdquo; he cried out; &ldquo;by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By D&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; said Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, it is perfectly true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos turned towards Grimaud, as if he needed a second confirmation of
      the intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimaud nodded his head. &ldquo;And where have they taken him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably to the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we came along we questioned some persons, who saw the carriage pass;
      and others who saw it enter the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; muttered Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you intend to do?&rdquo; inquired Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Nothing; only I will not have Athos remain at the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Raoul, advancing nearer to Porthos, &ldquo;that the arrest
      was made by order of the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porthos looked at the young man, as if to say, &ldquo;What does that matter to
      me?&rdquo; This dumb language seemed so eloquent of meaning to Raoul that he did
      not ask any other question. He mounted his horse again; and Porthos,
      assisted by Grimaud, had already done the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us arrange our plan of action,&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Porthos, &ldquo;that is the best thing we can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul sighed deeply, and then paused suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Porthos; &ldquo;are you faint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only I feel how utterly helpless our position is. Can we three
      pretend to go and take the Bastile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if D&rsquo;Artagnan were only here,&rdquo; replied Porthos, &ldquo;I am not so very
      certain we would fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul could not resist a feeling of admiration at the sight of such
      perfect confidence, heroic in its simplicity. These were truly the
      celebrated men who, by three or four, attacked armies and assaulted
      castles! Men who had terrified death itself, who had survived the wrecks
      of a tempestuous age, and still stood, stronger than the most robust of
      the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he to Porthos, &ldquo;you have just given me an idea; we
      absolutely must see M. d&rsquo;Artagnan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought by this time to have returned home, after having taken my father
      to the Bastile. Let us go to his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First inquire at the Bastile,&rdquo; said Grimaud, who was in the habit of
      speaking little, but that to the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, they hastened towards the fortress, when one of those chances
      which Heaven bestows on men of strong will caused Grimaud suddenly to
      perceive the carriage, which was entering by the great gate of the
      drawbridge. This was the moment that D&rsquo;Artagnan was, as we have seen,
      returning from his visit to the king. In vain was it that Raoul urged on
      his horse in order to join the carriage, and to see whom it contained. The
      horses had already gained the other side of the great gate, which again
      closed, while one of the sentries struck the nose of Raoul&rsquo;s horse with
      his musket; Raoul turned about, only too happy to find he had ascertained
      something respecting the carriage which had contained his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have him,&rdquo; said Grimaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we wait a little it is certain he will leave; don&rsquo;t you think so, my
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless, indeed, D&rsquo;Artagnan also be a prisoner,&rdquo; replied Porthos, &ldquo;in
      which case everything is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul returned no answer, for any hypothesis was admissible. He instructed
      Grimaud to lead the horses to the little street Jean-Beausire, so as to
      give rise to less suspicion, and himself with his piercing gaze watched
      for the exit either of D&rsquo;Artagnan or the carriage. Nor had he decided
      wrongly; for twenty minutes had not elapsed before the gate reopened and
      the carriage reappeared. A dazzling of the eyes prevented Raoul from
      distinguishing what figures occupied the interior. Grimaud averred that he
      had seen two persons, and that one of them was his master. Porthos kept
      looking at Raoul and Grimaud by turns, in the hope of understanding their
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is clear,&rdquo; said Grimaud, &ldquo;that if the comte is in the carriage, either
      he is set at liberty or they are taking him to another prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon see that by the road he takes,&rdquo; answered Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is set at liberty,&rdquo; said Grimaud, &ldquo;they will conduct him home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; rejoined Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage does not take that way,&rdquo; cried Raoul; and indeed the horses
      were just disappearing down the Faubourg St. Antoine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hasten,&rdquo; said Porthos; &ldquo;we will attack the carriage on the road
      and tell Athos to flee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebellion,&rdquo; murmured Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porthos darted a second glance at Raoul, quite worthy of the first. Raoul
      replied only by spurring the flanks of his steed. In a few moments the
      three cavaliers had overtaken the carriage, and followed it so closely
      that their horses&rsquo; breath moistened the back of it. D&rsquo;Artagnan, whose
      senses were ever on the alert, heard the trot of the horses, at the moment
      when Raoul was telling Porthos to pass the chariot, so as to see who was
      the person accompanying Athos. Porthos complied, but could not see
      anything, for the blinds were lowered. Rage and impatience were gaining
      mastery over Raoul. He had just noticed the mystery preserved by Athos&rsquo;s
      companion, and determined on proceeding to extremities. On his part
      D&rsquo;Artagnan had perfectly recognized Porthos, and Raoul also, from under
      the blinds, and had communicated to the comte the result of his
      observation. They were desirous only of seeing whether Raoul and Porthos
      would push the affair to the uttermost. And this they speedily did, for
      Raoul, presenting his pistol, threw himself on the leader, commanding the
      coachmen to stop. Porthos seized the coachman, and dragged him from his
      seat. Grimaud already had hold of the carriage door. Raoul threw open his
      arms, exclaiming, &ldquo;M. le comte! M. le comte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is it you, Raoul?&rdquo; said Athos, intoxicated with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad, indeed!&rdquo; added D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a burst of laughter, and they
      both embraced the young man and Porthos, who had taken possession of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brave Porthos! best of friends,&rdquo; cried Athos, &ldquo;it is still the same
      old way with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is still only twenty,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;brave Porthos!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it,&rdquo; answered Porthos, slightly confused, &ldquo;we thought that you
      were being arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While,&rdquo; rejoined Athos, &ldquo;the matter in question was nothing but my taking
      a drive in M. d&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we followed you from the Bastile,&rdquo; returned Raoul, with a tone of
      suspicion and reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where we had been to take supper with our friend M. Baisemeaux. Do you
      recollect Baisemeaux, Porthos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there we saw Aramis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Bastile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Porthos, again breathing freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave us a thousand messages to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is M. le comte going?&rdquo; asked Grimaud, already recompensed by a
      smile from his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were going home to Blois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once?&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, right forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without any luggage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Raoul would have been instructed to forward me mine, or to bring it
      with him on his return, <i>if</i> he returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If nothing detains him longer in Paris,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, with a glance
      firm and cutting as steel, and as painful (for it reopened the poor young
      fellow&rsquo;s wounds), &ldquo;he will do well to follow you, Athos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to keep me any longer in Paris,&rdquo; said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will go immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. d&rsquo;Artagnan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for me, I was only accompanying Athos as far as the barrier, and I
      return with Porthos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my son,&rdquo; added the comte, gently passing his arm around Raoul&rsquo;s
      neck to draw him into the carriage, and again embracing him. &ldquo;Grimaud,&rdquo;
       continued the comte, &ldquo;you will return quietly to Paris with your horse and
      M. du Vallon&rsquo;s, for Raoul and I will mount here and give up the carriage
      to these two gentlemen to return to Paris in; and then, as soon as you
      arrive, you will take my clothes and letters and forward the whole to me
      at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed Raoul, who was anxious to make the comte converse, &ldquo;when
      you return to Paris, there will not be a single thing there for you&mdash;which
      will be very inconvenient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it will be a very long time, Raoul, ere I return to Paris. The
      last sojourn we have made there has not been of a nature to encourage me
      to repeat it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raoul hung down his head and said not a word more. Athos descended from
      the carriage and mounted the horse which had brought Porthos, and which
      seemed no little pleased at the exchange. Then they embraced, and clasped
      each other&rsquo;s hands, and interchanged a thousand pledges of eternal
      friendship. Porthos promised to spend a month with Athos at the first
      opportunity. D&rsquo;Artagnan engaged to take advantage of his first leave of
      absence; and then, having embraced Raoul for the last time: &ldquo;To you, my
      boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will write.&rdquo; Coming from D&rsquo;Artagnan, who he knew wrote
      very seldom, these words expressed everything. Raoul was moved even to
      tears. He tore himself away from the musketeer and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Artagnan rejoined Porthos in the carriage: &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dear
      friend, what a day we have had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed we have,&rdquo; answered Porthos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be quite worn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite; however, I shall retire early to rest, so as to be ready for
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! to complete what I have begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me shudder, my friend, you seem to me quite angry. What the
      devil <i>have</i> you begun which is not finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen; Raoul has not fought, but <i>I</i> must fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom? with the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; exclaimed Porthos, astounded, &ldquo;with the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I say, you great baby, with the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you it is with M. Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look now, this is what I mean; you draw your sword against the king in
      fighting with this gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Porthos, staring; &ldquo;are you sure of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world are we to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try and make a good supper, Porthos. The captain of the
      musketeers keeps a tolerable table. There you will see the handsome
      Saint-Aignan, and will drink his health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried Porthos, horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Artagnan, &ldquo;you refuse to drink the king&rsquo;s health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, body alive! I am not talking to you about the king at all; I am
      speaking of M. de Saint-Aignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I repeat that it is the same thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, well!&rdquo; said Porthos, overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Porthos, &ldquo;but &lsquo;tis all the same.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter LXVII. M. de Baisemeaux&rsquo;s &ldquo;Society.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The reader has not forgotten that, on quitting the Bastile, D&rsquo;Artagnan and
      the Comte de la Fere had left Aramis in close confabulation with
      Baisemeaux. When once these two guests had departed, Baisemeaux did not in
      the least perceive that the conversation suffered by their absence. He
      used to think that wine after supper, and that of the Bastile in
      particular, was excellent, and that it was a stimulation quite sufficient
      to make any honest man talkative. But he little knew his Greatness, who
      was never more impenetrable than at dessert. His Greatness, however,
      perfectly understood M. de Baisemeaux, when he reckoned on making the
      governor discourse by the means which the latter regarded as efficacious.
      The conversation, therefore, without flagging in appearance, flagged in
      reality; for Baisemeaux not only had it nearly all to himself, but
      further, kept speaking only of that singular event, the incarceration of
      Athos, followed by so prompt an order to set him again at liberty. Nor,
      moreover, had Baisemeaux failed to observe that the two orders of arrest
      and of liberation, were both in the king&rsquo;s hand. But then, the king would
      not take the trouble to write similar orders except under pressing
      circumstances. All this was very interesting, and, above all, very
      puzzling to Baisemeaux; but as, on the other hand, all this was very clear
      to Aramis, the latter did not attach to the occurrence the same importance
      as did the worthy governor. Besides, Aramis rarely put himself out of the
      way for anything, and he had not yet told M. de Baisemeaux for what reason
      he had now done so. And so at the very climax of Baisemeaux&rsquo;s
      dissertation, Aramis suddenly interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, my dear Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have you never had any other
      diversions at the Bastile than those at which I assisted during the two or
      three visits I have had the honor to pay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This address was so unexpected that the governor, like a vane which
      suddenly receives an impulsion opposed to that of the wind, was quite
      dumbfounded at it. &ldquo;Diversions!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I take them continually,
      monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure! And these diversions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are of every kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Visits, no doubt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not visits. Visits are not frequent at the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, are visits rare, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even on the part of your society?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you term my society&mdash;the prisoners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&mdash;your prisoners, indeed! I know well it is you who visit
      them, and not they you. By your society, I mean, my dear Baisemeaux, the
      society of which you are a member.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux looked fixedly at Aramis, and then, as if the idea which had
      flashed across his mind were impossible, &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have very
      little society at present. If I must own it to you, dear M. d&rsquo;Herblay, the
      fact is, to stay at the Bastile appears, for the most part, distressing
      and distasteful to persons of the gay world. As for the ladies, it is
      never without a certain dread, which costs me infinite trouble to allay,
      that they succeed in reaching my quarters. And, indeed, how should they
      avoid trembling a little, poor things, when they see those gloomy
      dungeons, and reflect that they are inhabited by prisoners who&mdash;&rdquo; And
      in proportion as the eyes of Baisemeaux concentrated their gaze on the
      face of Aramis, the worthy governor&rsquo;s tongue faltered more and more until
      it ended by stopping altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand me, my dear M. Baisemeaux; you don&rsquo;t understand
      me. I do not at all mean to speak of society in general, but of a
      particular society&mdash;of <i>the</i> society, in a word&mdash;to which
      you are affiliated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux nearly dropped the glass of muscat which he was in the act of
      raising to his lips. &ldquo;Affiliated,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;affiliated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, affiliated, undoubtedly,&rdquo; repeated Aramis, with the greatest
      self-possession. &ldquo;Are you not a member of a secret society, my dear M.
      Baisemeaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secret or mysterious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, M. d&rsquo;Herblay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider, now, don&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe what I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my dear M. Baisemeaux; I say yes, you say no; one of us two
      necessarily says what is true, and the other, it inevitably follows, what
      is false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall come to an understanding presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux; &ldquo;let us see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now drink your glass of muscat, dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said
      Aramis. &ldquo;What the devil! you look quite scared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; not the least in the world; oh, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink then.&rdquo; Baisemeaux drank, but he swallowed the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Aramis, &ldquo;if, I say, you are not a member of a secret or
      mysterious society, which you like to call it&mdash;the epithet is of no
      consequence&mdash;if, I say, you are not a member of a society similar to
      that I wish to designate, well, then, you will not understand a word of
      what I am going to say. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! be sure beforehand that I shall not understand anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try, now; let us see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I am going to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, on the contrary, you are one of the members of this society, you will
      immediately answer me&mdash;yes or no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin your questions,&rdquo; continued Baisemeaux, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will agree, dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,&rdquo; continued Aramis, with the
      same impassibility, &ldquo;that it is evident a man cannot be a member of a
      society, it is evident that he cannot enjoy the advantages it offers to
      the affiliated, without being himself bound to certain little services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; stammered Baisemeaux, &ldquo;that would be intelligible, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Aramis, &ldquo;there is in the society of which I speak, and of
      which, as it seems you are not a member&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; said Baisemeaux. &ldquo;I should not like to say absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is an engagement entered into by all the governors and captains of
      fortresses affiliated to the order.&rdquo; Baisemeaux grew pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the engagement,&rdquo; continued Aramis firmly, &ldquo;is of this nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux rose, manifesting unspeakable emotion: &ldquo;Go on, dear M.
      d&rsquo;Herblay: go on,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis then spoke, or rather recited the following paragraph, in the same
      tone as if he had been reading it from a book: &ldquo;The aforesaid captain or
      governor of a fortress shall allow to enter, when need shall arise, and on
      demand of the prisoner, a confessor affiliated to the order.&rdquo; He stopped.
      Baisemeaux was quite distressing to look at, being so wretchedly pale and
      trembling. &ldquo;Is not that the text of the agreement?&rdquo; quietly asked Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; began Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well, you begin to understand, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; cried Baisemeaux, &ldquo;do not trifle so with my unhappy mind! I
      find myself as nothing in your hands, if you have the malignant desire to
      draw from me the little secrets of my administration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! by no means; pray undeceive yourself, dear M. Baisemeaux; it is not
      the little secrets of your administration, but those of your conscience
      that I aim at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my conscience be it, dear M. d&rsquo;Herblay. But have some
      consideration for the situation I am in, which is no ordinary one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no ordinary one, my dear monsieur,&rdquo; continued the inflexible
      Aramis, &ldquo;if you are a member of this society; but it is a quite natural
      one if free from all engagement. You are answerable only to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, well! I obey only the king, and whom else would you have
      a French nobleman obey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis did not yield an inch, but with that silvery voice of his
      continued: &ldquo;It is very pleasant,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for a French nobleman, for a
      prelate of France, to hear a man of your mark express himself so loyally,
      dear De Baisemeaux, and having heard you to believe no more than you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you doubted, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you doubt no longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no longer any doubt that such a man as you, monsieur,&rdquo; said
      Aramis, gravely, &ldquo;does not faithfully serve the masters whom he
      voluntarily chose for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masters!&rdquo; cried Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, masters, I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur d&rsquo;Herblay, you are still jesting, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I understand that it is a more difficult position to have
      several masters than one; but the embarrassment is owing to you, my dear
      Baisemeaux, and I am not the cause of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; returned the unfortunate governor, more embarrassed than
      ever; &ldquo;but what are you doing? You are leaving the table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are behaving very strangely towards me, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am behaving strangely&mdash;how do you make that out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sworn, then, to put me to the torture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should be sorry to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have no longer anything to do here; and, indeed, I have duties
      to fulfil elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duties, so late as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; understand me now, my dear De Baisemeaux: they told me at the place
      whence I came, &lsquo;The aforesaid governor or captain will allow to enter, as
      need shall arise, on the prisoner&rsquo;s demand, a confessor affiliated with
      the order.&rsquo; I came; you do not know what I mean, and so I shall return to
      tell them that they are mistaken, and that they must send me elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you are&mdash;&rdquo; cried Baisemeaux, looking at Aramis almost in
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The confessor affiliated to the order,&rdquo; said Aramis, without changing his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, gentle as the words were, they had the same effect on the unhappy
      governor as a clap of thunder. Baisemeaux became livid, and it seemed to
      him as if Aramis&rsquo;s beaming eyes were two forks of flame, piercing to the
      very bottom of his soul. &ldquo;The confessor!&rdquo; murmured he; &ldquo;you, monseigneur,
      the confessor of the order!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I; but we have nothing to unravel together, seeing that you are not
      one of the affiliated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I understand that, not being so, you refuse to comply with its
      command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, I beseech you, condescend to hear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, I do not say that I have nothing to do with the society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say not that I refuse to obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, M. de Baisemeaux, what has passed wears very much the air
      of resistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! monseigneur, no; I only wished to be certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be certain of what?&rdquo; said Aramis, in a tone of supreme contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of nothing at all, monseigneur.&rdquo; Baisemeaux lowered his voice, and
      bending before the prelate, said, &ldquo;I am at all times and in all places at
      the disposal of my superiors, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I like you better thus, monsieur,&rdquo; said Aramis, as he resumed
      his seat, and put out his glass to Baisemeaux, whose hand trembled so that
      he could not fill it. &ldquo;You were saying &lsquo;but&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; continued Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied the unhappy man, &ldquo;having received no notice, I was very far
      from expecting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not the Gospel say, &lsquo;Watch, for the moment is known only of God?&rsquo; Do
      not the rules of the order say, &lsquo;Watch, for that which I will, you ought
      always to will also.&rsquo; And what pretext will serve you now that you did not
      expect the confessor, M. de Baisemeaux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, monseigneur, there is at present in the Bastile no prisoner
      ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;What do you know about that?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, nevertheless, it appears to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Baisemeaux,&rdquo; said Aramis, turning round in his chair, &ldquo;here is your
      servant, who wishes to speak with you;&rdquo; and at this moment, De
      Baisemeaux&rsquo;s servant appeared at the threshold of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Baisemeaux, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;they are bringing you the doctor&rsquo;s return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked at De Baisemeaux with a calm and confident eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let the messenger enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The messenger entered, saluted, and handed in the report. Baisemeaux ran
      his eye over it, and raising his head, said in surprise, &ldquo;No. 12 is ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it, then,&rdquo; said Aramis, carelessly, &ldquo;that you told me everybody
      was well in your hotel, M. de Baisemeaux?&rdquo; And he emptied his glass
      without removing his eyes from Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor then made a sign to the messenger, and when he had quitted
      the room, said, still trembling, &ldquo;I think that there is in the article,
      &lsquo;on the prisoner&rsquo;s demand.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is so,&rdquo; answered Aramis. &ldquo;But see what it is they want with you
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that moment a sergeant put his head in at the door. &ldquo;What do you want
      now?&rdquo; cried Baisemeaux. &ldquo;Can you not leave me in peace for ten minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;the sick man, No. 12, has commissioned the
      turnkey to request you to send him a confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux very nearly sank on the floor; but Aramis disdained to reassure
      him, just as he had disdained to terrify him. &ldquo;What must I answer?&rdquo;
       inquired Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what you please,&rdquo; replied Aramis, compressing his lips; &ldquo;that is
      your business. <i>I</i> am not the governor of the Bastile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the prisoner,&rdquo; cried Baisemeaux, quickly,&mdash;&ldquo;tell the prisoner
      that his request is granted.&rdquo; The sergeant left the room. &ldquo;Oh!
      monseigneur, monseigneur,&rdquo; murmured Baisemeaux, &ldquo;how could I have
      suspected!&mdash;how could I have foreseen this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who requested you to suspect, and who besought you to foresee?&rdquo;
       contemptuously answered Aramis. &ldquo;The order suspects; the order knows; the
      order foresees&mdash;is that not enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you command?&rdquo; added Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&mdash;nothing at all. I am nothing but a poor priest, a simple
      confessor. Have I your orders to go and see the sufferer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monseigneur, I do not order; I pray you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well; conduct me to him.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <h3>
        TRANSCRIBER&rsquo;S NOTE:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a multi volume file
      </p>
      <p>
        The index has links to all volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two html files in each zipped html folder. The .....-h.htm
        file should be used if you wish to use a downloaded file off-line which
        will link to all the other files in the set which are still on-line. The
        .....-h2.htm file will be used only if you wish to build a complete
        off-line set of files as the links in this html file are designed only
        for off-line use. If you want to download all three volumes and have the
        links work on your own computer, then follow these directions carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Create a directory (folder) named whatever you like (e.g.,
        Maupassant). (The name of this directory (folder) is not critical, but
        the inner folders <i>must</i> be named as listed below, or the links
        between volumes will <i>not</i> work).
      </p>
      <p>
        2. In that directory (folder) create as many directories (folders) as
        there are volumes in the set and name each of new folders after the
        original filename, for example:
      </p>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>
          20023
        </li>
        <li>
          24780
        </li>
        <li>
          28649
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        3. In each of the above directories you just created, create a directory
        of the same filename but this time in the pattern:
      </p>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>
          In the 20023 directory create a directory named 20023-h
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 24780 directory create a directory named 24780-h
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 28649 directory create a directory named 28649-h
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        4. Download the <i>zipped</i> html version of each volume from the PG
        Catalog.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Unzip the downloaded files, you will find an html directory for
        example 20023-h which contains two html files named, for example,
        20023-h.htm and 20023-h2.htm
      </p>
      <ul class="nonetn">
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 20023-h2.htm file and its &ldquo;images&rdquo; directory into
          your new 20023-h directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 24780-h2.htm file and its &ldquo;images&rdquo; directory into
          your new 24780-h directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 28649-h2.htm file and its &ldquo;images&rdquo; directory into
          your new 28649-h directory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="short" />
      <p>
        Rename each of the html files by removing the number 2 at the end of the
        filename so for each you have, for example, 20023-h2.htm changed to
        20023-h.htm

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
