<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>In the months of
March-July in 1844, in the magazine <i>Le Si&egrave;cle</i>, the
first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated
playwright Alexandre Dumas.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was based, he claimed, on some
manuscripts he had found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque
Nationale while researching a history he planned to write on
Louis XIV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
chronicled the adventures of a young man named D'Artagnan who,
upon entering Paris, became almost immediately embroiled in court
intrigues, international politics, and ill-fated affairs between
royal lovers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Over the
next six years, readers would enjoy the adventures of this youth
and his three famous friends, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as
their exploits unraveled behind the scenes of some of the most
momentous events in French and even English history.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Eventually these
serialized adventures were published in novel form, and became
the three D'Artagnan Romances known today.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here is a brief summary of the first
two novels:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>The Three Musketeers</u> (serialized
March - July, 1844): The year is 1625.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young D'Artagnan arrives in
Paris at the tender age of 18, and almost immediately offends
three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Instead of dueling, the four are
attacked by five of the Cardinal's guards, and the courage of the
youth is made apparent during the battle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The four become fast friends, and,
when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord to find his missing wife,
embark upon an adventure that takes them across both France and
England in order to thwart the plans of the Cardinal
Richelieu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Along the way,
they encounter a beautiful young spy, named simply Milady, who
will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of Austria before her
husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the four
friends.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Twenty Years After</u> (serialized
January - August, 1845): The year is now 1648, twenty years since
the close of the last story.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis XIII has died, as has Cardinal
Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit upon the head of
Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV, the real power
resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan is now a lieutenant
of musketeers, and his three friends have retired to private
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos turned out to
be a nobleman, the Comte de la F&egrave;re, and has retired to
his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis, whose real name is
D'Herblay, has followed his intention of shedding the musketeer's
cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has married a wealthy
woman, who left him her fortune upon her death.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But trouble is stirring in both
France and England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Cromwell menaces the institution of royalty itself while marching
against Charles I, and at home the Fronde is threatening to tear
France apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
brings his friends out of retirement to save the threatened
English monarch, but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to
avenge his mother's death at the musketeers' hands, thwarts their
valiant efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Undaunted, our heroes return to France just in time to help save
the young Louis XIV, quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of
Cardinal Mazarin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The third novel, <u>The
Vicomte de Bragelonne</u> (serialized October, 1847 - January,
1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English
translation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It has been
split into three, four, or five volumes at various points in its
history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The five-volume
edition generally does not give titles to the smaller portions,
but the others do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the
three-volume edition, the novels are entitled <u>The Vicomte de
Bragelonne</u>, <u>Louise de la Valli&egrave;re</u>, and <u>The
Man in the Iron Mask</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
For the purposes of this etext, I have chosen to split the novel
as the four-volume edition does, with these titles: <u>The
Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>, <u>Ten Years Later</u>, <u>Louise de
la Valli&egrave;re</u>, and <u>The Man in the Iron Mask</u>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the first two etexts:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u> (Etext
2609): It is the year 1660, and D'Artagnan, after thirty-five
years of loyal service, has become disgusted with serving King
Louis XIV while the real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin,
and has tendered his resignation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He embarks on his own project, that
of restoring Charles II to the throne of England, and, with the
help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune in the
process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
returns to Paris to live the life of a rich citizen, and Athos,
after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king's brother, to
Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own
estate, La F&egrave;re.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to assume the
reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly
Mazarin's trusted clerk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet, the king's
superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any means
necessary to bring about his fall.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With the new rank of intendant
bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of
Fouquet's loyal friends tried and executed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then brings to the king's
attention that Fouquet is fortifying the island of
Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer, and could possibly be planning to use it
as a base for some military operation against the king.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis calls D'Artagnan out of
retirement and sends him to investigate the island, promising him
a tremendous salary and his long-promised promotion to captain of
the musketeers upon his return.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At Belle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers
that the engineer of the fortifications is, in fact, Porthos, now
the Baron du Vallon, and that's not all.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The blueprints for the island,
although in Porthos's handwriting, show evidence of another
script that has been erased, that of Aramis.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan later discovers that
Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes, which is, coincidentally,
a parish belonging to M. Fouquet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suspecting that D'Artagnan has
arrived on the king's behalf to investigate, Aramis tricks
D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos, and
sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of
the danger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet
rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a present, thus
allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating Colbert,
just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an
audience with the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Ten Years Later</u> (Etext 2681): As 1661
approaches, Princess Henrietta of England arrives for her
marriage, and throws the court of France into complete
disorder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The jealousy of
the Duke of Buckingham, who is in love with her, nearly occasions
a war on the streets of Le Havre, thankfully prevented by Raoul's
timely and tactful intervention.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After the marriage, though, Monsieur
Philip becomes horribly jealous of Buckingham, and has him
exiled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Before leaving,
however, the duke fights a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes is a malicious and
spiteful man, the sworn enemy of D'Artagnan, and, by the same
token, that of Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Raoul as well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Both men are seriously
wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul's friend, the comte de
Guiche, is the next to succumb to Henrietta's charms, and
Monsieur obtains his exile as well, though De Guiche soon effects
a reconciliation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
then the king's eye falls on Madame Henrietta during the comte's
absence, and this time Monsieur's jealousy has no recourse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of Austria intervenes,
and the king and his sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady
with whom the king can pretend to be in love, the better to mask
their own affair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
unfortunately select Louise de la Valli&egrave;re, Raoul's
fianc&eacute;e.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While the
court is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting
overhears Louise confessing her love for him while chatting with
her friends beneath the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets
his affection for Madame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De Guiche
confessing his love for her to Raoul.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two embark on their own
affair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A few days later,
during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise are trapped alone together,
and the whole court begins to talk of the scandal while their
love affair blossoms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Aware of Louise's attachment, the king arranges for Raoul to be
sent to England for an indefinite period.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Meanwhile, the struggle
for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although the Belle-Isle plot
backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask Fouquet for more and
more money, and without his two friends to raise it for him,
Fouquet is sorely pressed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The situation gets so bad that his
new mistress, Madame de Belli&egrave;re, must resort to selling
all her jewels and her gold and silver plate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis, while this is going on, has
grown friendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de
Baisemeaux, a fact that Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to
D'Artagnan while inquiring of him as to Aramis's
whereabouts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This further
arouses the suspicions of the musketeer, who was made to look
ridiculous by Aramis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
had ridden overnight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes
after Fouquet had already presented Belle-Isle to the king.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis learns from the
governor the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a
remarkable resemblance to Louis XIV - in fact, the two are
identical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He uses the
existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the
general of the society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the
new general of the order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
On Aramis's advice, hoping to use Louise's influence with the
king to counteract Colbert's influence, Fouquet also writes a
love letter to La Valli&egrave;re, unfortunately undated.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It never reaches its
destination, however, as the servant ordered to deliver it turns
out to be an agent of Colbert's.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos, in the
meantime, has been recovering from his midnight ride from
Belle-Isle at Fouquet's residence at Saint-Mand&eacute;.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos has retired, once again
to La F&egrave;re.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan, little amused by the court's activities at
Fontainebleau, and finding himself with nothing to do, has
returned to Paris, and we find him again in Planchet's grocery
shop.</p>

D</span>uring all these long and noisy debates between the
opposite ambitions of politics and love, one of our characters,
perhaps the one least deserving of neglect, was, however, very
much neglected, very much forgotten, and exceedingly
unhappy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact,
D'Artagnan - D'Artagnan, we say, for we must call him by his
name, to remind our readers of his existence - D'Artagnan, we
repeat, had absolutely nothing whatever to do, amidst these
brilliant butterflies of fashion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After following the king during two
whole days at Fontainebleau, and critically observing the various
pastoral fancies and heroi-comic transformations of his
sovereign, the musketeer felt that he needed something more than
this to satisfy the cravings of his nature.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At every moment assailed by people
asking him, "How do you think this costume suits me, Monsieur
d'Artagnan?" he would reply to them in quiet, sarcastic tones,
"Why, I think you are quite as well-dressed as the best-dressed
monkey to be found in the fair at Saint-Laurent."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was just such a compliment
D'Artagnan would choose where he did not feel disposed to pay any
other: and, whether agreeable or not, the inquirer was obliged to
be satisfied with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Whenever any one asked him, "How do you intend to dress yourself
this evening?" he replied, "I shall undress myself;" at which the
ladies all laughed, and a few of them blushed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But after a couple of days passed in
this manner, the musketeer, perceiving that nothing serious was
likely to arise which would concern him, and that the king had
completely, or, at least, appeared to have completely forgotten
Paris, Saint-Mand&eacute;, and Belle-Isle - that M. Colbert's
mind was occupied with illuminations and fireworks - that for the
next month, at least, the ladies had plenty of glances to bestow,
and also to receive in exchange - D'Artagnan asked the king for
leave of absence for a matter of private business.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the moment D'Artagnan made his
request, his majesty was on the point of going to bed, quite
exhausted from dancing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You wish to leave me,
Monsieur d'Artagnan?" inquired the king, with an air of
astonishment; for Louis XIV. could never understand why any one
who had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to
leave him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said D'Artagnan,
"I leave you simply because I am not of the slightest service to
you in anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! if I
could only hold the balancing-pole while you were dancing, it
would be a very different affair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, my dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan," said the king, gravely, "people dance without
balancing-poles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! indeed," said the
musketeer, continuing his imperceptible tone of irony, "I had no
idea such a thing was possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have not seen me
dance, then?" inquired the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but I always
thought dancers went from easy to difficult acrobatic feats.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was mistaken; all the more
greater reason, therefore, that I should leave for a time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sire, I repeat, you have no
present occasion for my services; besides, if your majesty should
have any need of me, you would know where to find me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well," said the
king, and he granted him leave of absence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> We shall not look for
D'Artagnan, therefore, at Fontainebleau, for to do so would be
useless; but, with the permission of our readers, follow him to
the Rue des Lombards, where he was located at the sign of the
Pilon d'Or, in the house of our old friend Planchet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was about eight o'clock in the
evening, and the weather was exceedingly warm; there was only one
window open, and that one belonging to a room on the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entresol</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A perfume of spices, mingled with
another perfume less exotic, but more penetrating, namely, that
which arose from the street, ascended to salute the nostrils of
the musketeer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan, reclining in an immense straight-backed chair, with
his legs not stretched out, but simply placed upon a stool,
formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly be
seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Both his arms were
crossed over his head, his head reclining upon his left shoulder,
like Alexander the Great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
His eyes, usually so quick and intelligent in their expression,
were now half-closed, and seemed fastened, as it were, upon a
small corner of blue sky that was visible behind the opening of
the chimneys; there was just enough blue, and no more, to fill
one of the sacks of lentils, or haricots, which formed the
principal furniture of the shop on the ground floor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus extended at his ease, and
sheltered in his place of observation behind the window,
D'Artagnan seemed as if he had ceased to be a soldier, as if he
were no longer an officer belonging to the palace, but was, on
the contrary, a quiet, easy-going citizen in a state of
stagnation between his dinner and supper, or between his supper
and his bed; one of those strong, ossified brains, which have no
more room for a single idea, so fiercely does animal matter keep
watch at the doors of intelligence, narrowly inspecting the
contraband trade which might result from the introduction into
the brain of a symptom of thought.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We have already said night was
closing in, the shops were being lighted, while the windows of
the upper apartments were being closed, and the rhythmic steps of
a patrol of soldiers forming the night watch could be heard
retreating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
continued, however, to think of nothing, except the blue corner
of the sky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A few paces
from him, completely in the shade, lying on his stomach, upon a
sack of Indian corn, was Planchet, with both his arms under his
chin, and his eyes fixed on D'Artagnan, who was either thinking,
dreaming, or sleeping, with his eyes open.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet had been watching him for a
tolerably long time, and, by way of interruption, he began by
exclaiming, "Hum! hum!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But D'Artagnan did not stir.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet then saw that it was
necessary to have recourse to more effectual means still: after a
prolonged reflection on the subject, the most ingenious means
that suggested itself to him under the present circumstances, was
to let himself roll off the sack on to the floor, murmuring, at
the same time, against himself, the word "stupid."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, notwithstanding the noise
produced by Planchet's fall, D'Artagnan, who had in the course of
his existence heard many other, and very different falls, did not
appear to pay the least attention to the present one.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, an enormous cart, laden
with stones, passing from the Rue Saint-M&eacute;d&eacute;ric,
absorbed, in the noise of its wheels, the noise of Planchet's
tumble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet Planchet
fancied that, in token of tacit approval, he saw him
imperceptibly smile at the word "stupid."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This emboldened him to say, "Are you
asleep, Monsieur d'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, Planchet, I am not
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>even</i> asleep," replied
the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am in despair," said
Planchet, "to hear such a word as <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>even</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, and why not; is
it not a grammatical word, Monsieur Planchet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of course, Monsieur
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, the word
distresses me beyond measure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Tell me why you are
distressed, Planchet," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If you say that you are
not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>even</i> asleep, it is
as much as to say that you have not even the consolation of being
able to sleep; or, better still, it is precisely the same as
telling me that you are getting bored to death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Planchet, you know that
I am never bored."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Except to-day, and the
day before yesterday."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur d'Artagnan, it
is a week since you returned here from Fontainebleau; in other
words, you have no longer your orders to issue, or your men to
review and maneuver.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
need the sound of guns, drums, and all that din and confusion; I,
who have myself carried a musket, can easily believe that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Planchet," replied
D'Artagnan, "I assure you I am not bored in the least in the
world."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, what are
you doing, lying there, as if you were dead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear Planchet, there
was, once upon a time, at the siege of La Rochelle, when I was
there, when you were there, when we both were there, a certain
Arab, who was celebrated for the manner in which he adjusted
culverins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was a
clever fellow, although of a very odd complexion, which was the
same color as your olives.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, this Arab, whenever he had
done eating or working, used to sit down to rest himself, as I am
resting myself now, and smoked I cannot tell you what sort of
magical leaves, in a large amber-mouthed tube; and if any
officers, happening to pass, reproached him for being always
asleep, he used quietly to reply: 'Better to sit down than to
stand up, to lie down than to sit down, to be dead than to lie
down.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was an acutely
melancholy Arab, and I remember him perfectly well, form the
color of his skin, and the style of his conversation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He used to cut off the heads of
Protestants with the most singular gusto!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely; and then
used to embalm them, when they were worth the trouble; and when
he was thus engaged with his herbs and plants about him, he
looked like a basket-maker making baskets."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are quite right,
Planchet, he did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I can remember things very well, at
times!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have no doubt of it;
but what do you think of his mode of reasoning?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I think it good in one
sense, but very stupid in another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Expound your meaning,
M. Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, monsieur, in
point of fact, then, 'better to sit down than to stand up,' is
plain enough, especially when one may be fatigued," and Planchet
smiled in a roguish way; "as for 'better to be lying down,' let
that pass, but as for the last proposition, that it is 'better to
be dead than alive,' it is, in my opinion, very absurd, my own
undoubted preference being for my bed; and if you are not of my
opinion, it is simply, as I have already had the honor of telling
you, because you are boring yourself to death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are thinking, you
say?" said Planchet, uneasily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; your house is dull
enough to drive people to think; you will admit that, I
hope."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet, monsieur, you
have a look-out upon the street."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; and wonderfully
interesting that is, of course."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But it is no less true,
monsieur, that, if you were living at the back of the house, you
would bore yourself - I mean, you would think - more than
ever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Upon my word, Planchet,
I hardly know that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Still," said the
grocer, "if your reflections are at all like those which led you
to restore King Charles II. - " and Planchet finished by a little
laugh which was not without its meaning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet, my friend," returned
D'Artagnan, "you are getting ambitious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is there no other king
to be restored, M. d'Artagnan - no second Monk to be packed up,
like a salted hog, in a deal box?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, my dear Planchet;
all the kings are seated on their respective thrones; less
comfortably so, perhaps, than I am upon this chair; but, at all
events, there they are."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And D'Artagnan sighed deeply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur d'Artagnan,"
said Planchet, "you are making me very uneasy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I begin to suspect
something."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur d'Artagnan,
you are getting thin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said D'Artagnan,
striking his chest which sounded like an empty cuirass, "it is
impossible, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said Planchet,
slightly overcome; "if you were to get thin in my house - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should do something
rash."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What would you do?<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should look out for
the man who was the cause of all your anxieties."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! according to your
account, I am anxious now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, you are anxious;
and you are getting thin, visibly getting thin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=

thin, in this way, I will take my sword in my hand, and go
straight to M. d'Herblay, and have it out with him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What!" said M.
d'Artagnan, starting in his chair; "what's that you say?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And what has M. d'Herblay's
name to do with your groceries?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Just as you

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan had, during
this second outburst of Planchet's, so placed himself as not to
lose a single look of his face; that is, he sat with both his
hands resting on both his knees, and his head stretched out
towards the grocer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Come, explain yourself," he said, "and tell me how you could
possibly utter such a blasphemy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. d'Herblay, your old master, my
friend, an ecclesiastic, a musketeer turned bishop - do you mean
to say you would raise your sword against him, Planchet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I could raise my sword
against my own father, when I see you in such a state as you are

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Aramis!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, uneasily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not so; for every time,
during the last three days, when you went out, you have not once
failed to ask me, on your return, 'Have you seen M. d'Herblay?'

d'Herblay?'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

such an extent as to get thin on that account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

fatter; I give you my word of honor I will."</p>

Aramis any more; and I will never ask you again if there are any

thing to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am a great observer;
and just now you made use of a very singular oath, which is
unusual for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is the oath I have
used ever since I have been a grocer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very proper, too; it is
the name of a dried grape, or raisin, I believe?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is my most ferocious
oath; when I have once said <i style=

longer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Still, I never knew you

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very likely not,
monsieur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had a present
made me of it," said Planchet; and, as he pronounced these words,
he winked his eye with a cunning expression, which thoroughly
awakened D'Artagnan's attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, come, M.
Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, I am not like you,
monsieur," said Planchet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"I don't pass my life in thinking."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do wrong,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean in boring myself
to death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We have but a
very short time to live - why not make the best of it?"</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are an Epicurean
philosopher, I begin to think, Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why not?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My hand is still as steady as ever;
I can write, and can weigh out my sugar and spices; my foot is
firm; I can dance and walk about; my stomach has its teeth still,
for I eat and digest very well; my heart is not quite
hardened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, what,
Planchet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, you see - " said
the grocer, rubbing his hands together.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan crossed one
leg over the other, and said, "Planchet, my friend, I am unnerved
with extreme surprise; for you are revealing yourself to me under
a perfectly new light."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet, flattered in
the highest degree by this remark, continued to rub his hands
very hard together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah,
ah," he said, "because I happen to be only slow, you think me,
perhaps, a positive fool."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

very well reasoned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Follow my idea,
monsieur, if you please.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I said to myself," continued Planchet, "that, without enjoyment,
there is no happiness on this earth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Quite true, what you
say, Planchet," interrupted D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At all events, if we
cannot obtain pleasure - for pleasure is not so common a thing,
after all - let us, at least, get consolations of some kind or
another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And so you console
yourself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I put on a buckler for
the purpose of confronting <i style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I place my time at the direction of
patience; and on the very eve of feeling I am going to get bored,
I amuse myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

difficulty in that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

quite by yourself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is miraculous."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I say, that your
philosophy is not to be matched in the Christian or pagan world,
in modern days or in antiquity!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

my example, then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I could not wish for
anything better; but all minds are not of the same stamp; and it
might possibly happen that if I were required to amuse myself in
the manner you do, I should bore myself horribly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bah! at least try
first."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

I leave home occasionally?"</p>

noticed it, then?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear
Planchet, you must understand that when people see each other

him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you not feel the
want of my society when I am in the country?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to say, I feel like a body without a soul."</p>

then, proceed."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What are

two, sometimes three, and sometimes four days at a time."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have you
ever given it a thought, why I was absent?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To look after your
debts, I suppose."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And when I

concerned?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

self-satisfied."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You admit,
you say, that I always look satisfied.<span style=

satisfaction to?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That your business was
going on very well; that your purchases of rice, prunes, raw
sugar, dried apples, pears, and treacle were advantageous.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You were always very
picturesque in your notions and ideas, Planchet; and I was not in
the slightest degree surprised to find you had selected grocery
as an occupation, which is of all trades the most varied, and the
very pleasantest, as far as the character is concerned; inasmuch
as one handles so many natural and perfumed productions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Perfectly true,
monsieur; but you are very greatly mistaken."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In thinking that I
heave here every fortnight, to collect my money or to make
purchases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ho, ho! how
could you possibly have thought such a thing?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ho, ho, ho!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Planchet began to laugh in a
manner that inspired D'Artagnan with very serious misgivings as
to his sanity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I confess," said the
musketeer, "that I do not precisely catch your meaning."</p>

monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

'very true'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

opinion of you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; you are a man of
genius; and whenever the question happens to be of war, tactics,
surprises, or good honest blows to be dealt with, why, kings are
marionettes, compared to you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But for the consolations of the
mind, the proper care of the body, the agreeable things of like,
if one may say so - ah! monsieur, don't talk to me about men of
genius; they are nothing short of executioners."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

really fidgety with curiosity, "upon my word you interest me in

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan by a wink full of sly humor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

there, you rascal."</p>

to-morrow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

if you like; and then, besides, to-morrow is the 14th, that is to
say, the day before the one when I am afraid of getting bored; so
we will look upon it as an understood thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Agreed, by all

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; I prefer the
gentlest of all; I never was a very good rider, as you know, and
in my grocery business I have got more awkward than ever; besides
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Besides what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why," added Planchet,
"I do not wish to fatigue myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so?" D'Artagnan
ventured to ask.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because I should lose
half the pleasure I expect to enjoy," replied Planchet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And thereupon he rose from his
sack of Indian corn, stretching himself, and making all his bones
crack, one after the other, with a sort of harmony.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Planchet!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet!" exclaimed D'Artagnan, "I
do declare that there is no sybarite upon the face of the globe
who can for a moment be compared to you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, Planchet, it is very clear that
we have never yet eaten a ton of salt together."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so, monsieur?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because,
even now I can scarcely say I know you," said D'Artagnan, "and
because, in point of fact, I return to the opinion which, for a
moment, I had formed of you that day at Boulogne, when you
strangled, or did so as nearly as possible, M. de Wardes's valet,
Lubin; in plain language, Planchet, that you are a man of great
resources."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet began to laugh
with a laugh full of self-conceit; bade the musketeer good-night,
and went down to his back shop, which he used as a bedroom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan resumed his
original position upon his chair, and his brow, which had been
unruffled for a moment, became more pensive than ever.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had already forgotten the
whims and dreams of Planchet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes," said he, taking up again the
thread of his thoughts, which had been broken by the whimsical
conversation in which we have just permitted our readers to
participate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, yes,
those three points include everything: First, to ascertain what
Baisemeaux wanted with Aramis; secondly, to learn why Aramis does
not let me hear from him; and thirdly, to ascertain where Porthos
is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The whole mystery
lies in these three points.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Since, therefore," continued
D'Artagnan, "our friends tell us nothing, we must have recourse

D</span>'Artagnan, faithful to his plan, went the very next
morning to pay a visit to M. de Baisemeaux.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was cleaning up or tidying day at
the Bastile; the cannons were furbished up, the staircases
scraped and cleaned; and the jailers seemed to be carefully
engaged in polishing the very keys.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for the soldiers belonging to the
garrison, they were walking about in different courtyards, under
the pretense that they were clean enough.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The governor, Baisemeaux, received
D'Artagnan with more than ordinary politeness, but he behaved
towards him with so marked a reserve of manner, that all
D'Artagnan's tact and cleverness could not get a syllable out of
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The more he kept
himself within bounds, the more D'Artagnan's suspicion
increased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter
even fancied he remarked that the governor was acting under the
influence of a recent recommendation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Baisemeaux had not been at the
Palais Royal with D'Artagnan the same cold and impenetrable man
which the latter now found in the Baisemeaux of the Bastile.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When D'Artagnan wished to make
him talk about the urgent money matters which had brought
Baisemeaux in search of D'Artagnan, and had rendered him
expansive, notwithstanding what had passed on that evening,
Baisemeaux pretended that he had some orders to give in the
prison, and left D'Artagnan so long alone waiting for him, that
our musketeer, feeling sure that he should not get another
syllable out of him, left the Bastile without waiting until
Baisemeaux returned from his inspection.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But D'Artagnan's suspicions were
aroused, and when once that was the case, D'Artagnan could not
sleep or remain quiet for a moment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was among men what the cat is
among quadrupeds, the emblem of anxiety and impatience, at the
same moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A restless
cat can no more remain the same place than a silk thread wafted
idly to and fro with every breath of air.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A cat on the watch is as motionless
as death stationed at is place of observation, and neither hunger
nor thirst can draw it from its meditations.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, who was burning with
impatience, suddenly threw aside the feeling, like a cloak which
he felt too heavy on his shoulders, and said to himself that that
which they were concealing from him was the very thing it was
important he should know; and, consequently, he reasoned that
Baisemeaux would not fail to put Aramis on his guard, if Aramis
had given him any particular recommendation, and this was, in
fact, the very thing that happened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Baisemeaux had hardly
had time to return from the donjon, than D'Artagnan placed
himself in ambuscade close to the Rue de Petit-Musc, so as to see
every one who might leave the gates of the Bastile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After he had spent an hour on the
look-out from the "Golden Portcullis," under the pent-house of
which he could keep himself a little in the shade, D'Artagnan
observed a soldier leave the Bastile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was, indeed, the surest
indication he could possibly have wished for, as every jailer or
warder has certain days, and even certain hours, for leaving the
Bastile, since all are alike prohibited from having either wives
or lodgings in the castle, and can accordingly leave without
exciting any curiosity; but a soldier once in barracks is kept
there for four and twenty hours when on duty, - and no one knew
this better than D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The guardsman in question,
therefore, was not likely to leave his regimentals, except on an
express and urgent order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The soldier, we were saying, left the Bastile at a slow and
lounging pace, like a happy mortal, in fact, who, instead of
mounting sentry before a wearisome guard-house, or upon a bastion
no less wearisome, has the good luck to get a little liberty, in
addition to a walk - both pleasures being luckily reckoned as
part of his time on duty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He bent his steps towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, enjoying
the fresh air and the warmth of the sun, and looking at all the
pretty faces he passed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan followed him at a distance; he had not yet arranged
his ideas as what was to be done.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I must, first of all," he thought,
"see the fellow's face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A
man seen is a man judged."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan increased his pace, and,
which was not very difficult, by the by, soon got in advance of
the soldier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Not only did
he observe that his face showed a tolerable amount of
intelligence and resolution, but he noticed also that his nose
was a little red.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "He has
a weakness for brandy, I see," said D'Artagnan to himself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the same moment that he
remarked his red nose, he saw that the soldier had a white paper
in his belt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good, he has a letter,"
added D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
only difficulty was to get hold of the letter.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But a common soldier would, of
course, be only too delighted at having been selected by M. de
Baisemeaux as a special messenger, and would not be likely to
sell his message.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As
D'Artagnan was biting his nails, the soldier continued to advance
more and more into the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "He is certainly going to
Saint-Mand&eacute;," he said to himself, "and I shall not be able
to learn what the letter contains."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was enough to drive him
wild.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "If I were in
uniform," said D'Artagnan to himself, "I would have this fellow
seized, and his letter with him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I could easily get assistance at the
very first guard-house; but the devil take me if I mention my
name in an affair of this kind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I were to treat him to something
to drink, his suspicions would be roused; and besides, he might
drink me drunk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i> my wits seem to have
left me," said D'Artagnan; "it is all over with me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yet, supposing I were to attack this
poor devil, make him draw his sword and kill him for the sake of
his letter?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No harm in
that, if it were a question of a letter from a queen to a
nobleman, or a letter from a cardinal to a queen; but what
miserable intrigues are those of Messieurs Aramis and Fouquet
with M. Colbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A man's
life for that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, no,
indeed; not even ten crowns."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As he philosophized in this manner,
biting first his nails, and then his mustaches, he perceived a
group of archers and a commissary of the police engaged in
carrying away a man of very gentlemanly exterior, who was
struggling with all his might against them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The archers had torn his clothes,
and were dragging him roughly away.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He begged they would lead him along
more respectfully, asserting that he was a gentleman and a
soldier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And observing
our soldier walking in the street, he called out, "Help,
comrade."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The soldier walked on
with the same step towards the man who had called out to him,
followed by the crowd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An
idea suddenly occurred to D'Artagnan; it was his first one, and
we shall find it was not a bad one either.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> During the time the gentleman was
relating to the soldier that he had just been seized in a house
as a thief, when the truth was he was only there as a lover; and
while the soldier was pitying him, and offering him consolation
and advice with that gravity which a French soldier has always
ready whenever his vanity or his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>esprit de corps</i> is concerned,
D'Artagnan glided behind the soldier, who was closely hemmed in
by the crowd, and with a rapid sweep, like a sabre slash,
snatched the letter from his belt.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As at this moment the gentleman with
the torn clothes was pulling about the soldier, to show how the
commissary of police had pulled him about, D'Artagnan effected
his pillage of the letter without the slightest
interference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
stationed himself about ten paces distant, behind the pillar of
an adjoining house, and read on the address, "To Monsieur du
Vallon, at Monsieur Fouquet's, Saint-Mand&eacute;."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good!" he said, and
then he unsealed, without tearing the letter, drew out the paper,
which was folded in four, from the inside; which contained only
these words:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:.5in'>
"DEAR MONSIEUR DU VALLON, - Will you be good enough to tell
Monsieur d'Herblay that <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he</i> has been to the Bastile, and

<span style=
'mso-tab-count:4'>                                                               </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good! all right!"
exclaimed D'Artagnan; "it is clear enough now.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos is engaged in it."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Being now satisfied of what he
wished to know: "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i>" thought the
musketeer, "what is to be done with that poor devil of a
soldier?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That hot-headed,
cunning fellow, De Baisemeaux, will make him pay dearly for my
trick, - if he returns without the letter, what will they do to
him?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, I don't
want the letter; when the egg has been sucked, what is the good
of the shell?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
perceived that the commissary and the archers had succeeded in
convincing the soldier, and went on their way with the prisoner,
the latter being still surrounded by the crowd, and continuing
his complaints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan advanced into the very middle of the crowd, let the
letter fall, without any one having observed him, and then
retreated rapidly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
soldier resumed his route towards Saint-Mand&eacute;, his mind
occupied with the gentleman who had implored his protection.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suddenly he thought of his
letter, and, looking at his belt, saw that it was no longer
there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan derived
no little satisfaction from his sudden, terrified cry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The poor soldier in the
greatest anguish of mind looked round him on every side, and at
last, about twenty paces behind him, he perceived the lucky
envelope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He pounced on
it like a falcon on its prey.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The envelope was certainly a little
dirty, and rather crumpled, but at all events the letter itself
was found.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
observed that the broken seal attracted the soldier's attention a
good deal, but he finished apparently by consoling himself, and
returned the letter to his belt.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Go on," said D'Artagnan, "I have
plenty of time before me, so you may precede me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It appears that Aramis is not in
Paris, since Baisemeaux writes to Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Dear Porthos, how delighted I shall
be to see him again, and to have some conversation with him!"
said the Gascon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And,
regulating his pace according to that of the soldier, he promised
himself to arrive a quarter of an hour after him at M.
Fouquet's.</p>

D</span>'Artagnan had, according to his usual style, calculated
that every hour is worth sixty minutes, and every minute worth
sixty seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thanks to
this perfectly exact calculation of minutes and seconds, he
reached the superintendent's door at the very moment the soldier
was leaving it with his belt empty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan presented himself at the
door, which a porter with a profusely embroidered livery held
half opened for him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan would very much have liked to enter without giving his
name, but this was impossible, and so he gave it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Notwithstanding this concession,
which ought to have removed every difficulty in the way, at least
D'Artagnan thought so, the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>concierge</i> hesitated; however,
at the second repetition of the title, captain of the king's
guards, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>concierge</i>,
without quite leaving the passage clear for him, ceased to bar it
completely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
understood that orders of the most positive character had been
given.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He decided,
therefore, to tell a falsehood, - a circumstance, moreover, which
did not seriously affect his peace of mind, when he saw that
beyond the falsehood the safety of the state itself, or even
purely and simply his own individual personal interest, might be
at stake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He moreover
added to the declarations he had already made, that the soldier
sent to M. du Vallon was his own messenger, and that the only
object that letter had in view was to announce his intended
arrival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From that
moment, no one opposed D'Artagnan's entrance any further, and he
entered accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A
valet wished to accompany him, but he answered that it was
useless to take that trouble on his account, inasmuch as he knew
perfectly well where M. du Vallon was.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was nothing, of course, to say
to a man so thoroughly and completely informed on all points, and
D'Artagnan was permitted, therefore, to do as he liked.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The terraces, the magnificent
apartments, the gardens, were all reviewed and narrowly inspected
by the musketeer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
walked for a quarter of an hour in this more than royal
residence, which included as many wonders as articles of
furniture, and as many servants as there were columns and
doors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Decidedly," he
said to himself, "this mansion has no other limits than the
pillars of the habitable world.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it probable Porthos has taken it
into his head to go back to Pierrefonds without even leaving M.
Fouquet's house?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
finally reached a remote part of the ch&acirc;teau inclosed by a
stone wall, which was covered with a profusion of thick plants,
luxuriant in blossoms as large and solid as fruit.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At equal distances on the top of
this wall were placed various statues in timid or mysterious
attitudes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These were
vestals hidden beneath the long Greek peplum, with its thick,
sinuous folds; agile nymphs, covered with their marble veils, and
guarding the palace with their fugitive glances.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A statue of Hermes, with his finger
on his lips; one of Iris, with extended wings; another of Night,
sprinkled all over with poppies, dominated the gardens and
outbuildings, which could be seen through the trees.<span style=

climbing roses, whose flowering rings were fastened to every fork

so perfect an Eden gave him a higher idea of Porthos, showing how
tremendously true it is, that even the very highest orders of
minds are not quite exempt from the influence of
surroundings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
found the door, and on, or rather in the door, a kind of spring
which he detected; having touched it, the door flew open.<span

door behind him, and advanced into a pavilion built in a circular

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

introduced into the <i style=

remain in expectation: a well-remembered step shook the floor of
the adjoining room, a door opened, or rather flew open, and
Porthos appeared and threw himself into his friend's arms with a
sort of embarrassment which did not ill become him.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Porthos; "on the contrary, we will speak of it; and so the king

all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whenever I feel

why he wished to keep it secret?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"How do you know
it, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"By a very simple
means.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I heard M. Fouquet
himself say so to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Say what to the
king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That he fortified
Belle-Isle on his majesty's account, and that he had made him a
present of Belle Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And you heard M.
Fouquet say that to the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In those very
words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He even added:
'Belle-Isle has been fortified by an engineer, one of my friends,
a man of a great deal of merit, whom I shall ask your majesty's
permission to present to you.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'What is his
name?' said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'The Baron du
Vallon,' M. Fouquet replied.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Very well,'
returned his majesty, 'you will present him to me.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The king said
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Upon the word of a
D'Artagnan!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, oh!" said
Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Why have I not
been presented, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have they not
spoken to you about this presentation?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, certainly;
but I am always kept waiting for it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Be easy, it will
be sure to come."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Humph! humph!"
grumbled Porthos, which D'Artagnan pretended not to hear; and,
changing the conversation, he said, "You seem to be living in a
very solitary place here, my dear fellow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I always preferred
retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am of a
melancholy disposition," replied Porthos, with a sigh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Really, that is
odd," said D'Artagnan, "I never remarked that before."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is only since I
have taken to reading, "said Porthos, with a thoughtful air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But the labors of
the mind have not affected the health of the body, I trust?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Not in the
slightest degree."<br>
"Your strength is as great as ever?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Too great, my
friend, too great."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had heard that, for a short time
after your arrival - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"That I could
hardly move a limb, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"How was it?" said
D'Artagnan, smiling, "and why was it you could not move?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos, perceiving
that he had made a mistake, wished to correct it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, I came from Belle-Isle upon
very hard horses," he said, "and that fatigued me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am no longer
astonished, then, since I, who followed you, found seven or eight
lying dead on the road."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am very heavy,
you know," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So that you were
bruised all over."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My marrow melted,
and that made me very ill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Poor Porthos!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But how did Aramis act towards
you under those circumstances?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well,
indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had me
attended to by M. Fouquet's own doctor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But just imagine, at the end of a
week I could not breathe any longer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you
mean?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The room was too
small; I had absorbed every atom of air."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Indeed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I was told so, at
least; and so I was removed into another apartment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where you were
able to breathe, I hope and trust?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, more freely;
but no exercise - nothing to do.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The doctor pretended that I was not
to stir; I, on the contrary, felt that I was stronger than ever;
that was the cause of a very serious accident."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What
accident?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Fancy, my dear
fellow, that I revolted against the directions of that ass of a
doctor, and I resolved to go out, whether it suited him or not:
and, consequently, I told the valet who waited on me to bring me
my clothes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You were quite
naked, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, no! on the
contrary, I had a magnificent dressing-gown to wear.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lackey obeyed; I dressed myself
in my own clothes, which had become too large for me; but a
strange circumstance had happened, - my feet had become too
large."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, I quite
understand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And my boots too
small."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You mean your feet
were still swollen?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly; you have
hit it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Pardieu!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And is that the accident you were
going to tell me about?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, yes; I did not
make the same reflection you have done.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I said to myself: 'Since my feet
have entered my boots ten times, there is no reason why they
should not go in the eleventh.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Allow me to tell
you, my dear Porthos, that on this occasion you failed in your
logic."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In short, then,
they placed me opposite to a part of the room which was
partitioned; I tried to get my boot on; I pulled it with my
hands, I pushed with all the strength of the muscles of my leg,
making the most unheard-of efforts, when suddenly the two tags of
my boot remained in my hands, and my foot struck out like a
ballista."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How learned you
are in fortification, dear Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My foot darted out
like a ballista, and came against the partition, which it broke
in; I really thought that, like Samson, I had demolished the
temple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the number of
pictures, the quantity of china, vases of flowers, carpets, and
window-panes that fell down were really wonderful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Indeed!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Without reckoning
that on the other side of the partition was a small table laden
with porcelain - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Which you knocked
over?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Which I dashed to
the other side of the room," said Porthos, laughing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Upon my word, it
is, as you say, astonishing," replied D'Artagnan, beginning to
laugh also; whereupon Porthos laughed louder than ever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I broke," said
Porthos, in a voice half-choked from his increasing mirth, "more
than three thousand francs worth of china - ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Good!" said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I smashed more
than four thousand francs worth of glass! - ho, ho, ho!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Excellent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Without counting a
luster, which fell on my head and was broken into a thousand
pieces - ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Upon your head?"
said D'Artagnan, holding his sides.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"On top."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But your head was
broken, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, since I tell
you, on the contrary, my dear fellow, that it was the luster
which was broken, like glass, which, in point of fact, it
was."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! the luster was
glass, you say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Venetian glass! a
perfect curiosity, quite matchless, indeed, and weighed two
hundred pounds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And it fell upon
your head!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Upon my head.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Just imagine, a globe of
crystal, gilded all over, the lower part beautifully encrusted,
perfumes burning at the top, with jets from which flame issued
when they were lighted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I quite
understand, but they were not lighted at the time, I
suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Happily not, or I
should have been grilled prematurely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And you were only
knocked down flat, instead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How, 'not at
all?'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, the luster
fell on my skull.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
appears that we have upon the top of our heads an exceedingly
thick crust."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Who told you that,
Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The doctor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A sort of dome which would
bear Notre-Dame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Bah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, it seems that
our skulls are made in that manner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Speak for
yourself, my dear fellow, it is your own skull that is made in
that manner, and not the skulls of other people."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, that may be
so," said Porthos, conceitedly, "so much, however, was that the
case, in my instance, that no sooner did the luster fall upon the
dome which we have at the top of our head, than there was a
report like a cannon, the crystal was broken to pieces, and I
fell, covered from head to foot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"With blood, poor
Porthos!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not at all; with
perfumes, which smelt like rich creams; it was delicious, but the
odor was too strong, and I felt quite giddy from it; perhaps you
have experienced it sometimes yourself, D'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, in inhaling
the scent of the lily of the valley; so that, my poor friend, you
were knocked over by the shock and overpowered by the
perfumes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; but what is
very remarkable, for the doctor told me he had never seen
anything like it - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You had a bump on
your head I suppose?" interrupted D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I had five."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why five?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will tell you;
the luster had, at its lower extremity, five gilt ornaments;
excessively sharp."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, these five
ornaments penetrated my hair, which, as you see, I wear very
thick."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Fortunately
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And they made a
mark on my skin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But just
notice the singularity of it, these things seem really only to
happen to me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Instead of
making indentations, they made bumps.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The doctor could never succeed in
explaining that to me satisfactorily."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then, I will
explain it to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will do me a
great service if you will," said Porthos, winking his eyes,
which, with him, was sign of the profoundest attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Since you have
been employing your brain in studies of an exalted character, in
important calculations, and so on, the head has gained a certain
advantage, so that your head is now too full of science."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you think
so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am sure of
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The result is, that,
instead of allowing any foreign matter to penetrate the interior
of the head, your bony box or skull, which is already too full,
avails itself of the openings which are made in allowing this
excess to escape."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!" said Porthos,
to whom this explanation appeared clearer than that of the
doctor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The five
protuberances, caused by the five ornaments of the luster, must
certainly have been scientific globules, brought to the surface
by the force of circumstances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In fact," said
Porthos, "the real truth is, that I felt far worse outside my
head than inside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will
even confess, that when I put my hat upon my head, clapping it on
my head with that graceful energy which we gentlemen of the sword
possess, if my fist was not very gently applied, I experienced
the most painful sensations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I quite believe
you, Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Therefore, my
friend," said the giant, "M. Fouquet decided, seeing how slightly
built the house was, to give me another lodging, and so they
brought me here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is the private
park, I think, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where the
rendezvous are made; that park, indeed, which is so celebrated in
some of those mysterious stories about the superintendent?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I don't know; I
have had no rendezvous or heard mysterious stories myself, but
they have authorized me to exercise my muscles, and I take
advantage of the permission by rooting up some of the trees."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To keep my hand
in, and also to take some birds' nests; I find it more convenient
than climbing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are as
pastoral as Tyrcis, my dear Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, I like the
small eggs; I like them very much better than larger ones.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have no idea how delicate
an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>omelette</i> is, if made
of four or five hundred eggs of linnets, chaffinches, starlings,
blackbirds, and thrushes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But five hundred
eggs is perfectly monstrous!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A salad-bowl will
hold them easily enough," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan looked
at Porthos admiringly for full five minutes, as if he had seen
him for the first time, while Porthos spread his chest out
joyously and proudly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
They remained in this state several minutes, Porthos smiling, and
D'Artagnan looking at him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was evidently trying to
give the conversation a new turn.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do you amuse yourself much here,
Porthos?" he asked at last, very likely after he had found out
what he was searching for.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not always."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I can imagine
that; but when you get thoroughly bored, by and by, what do you
intend to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall not be here for any length
of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis is
waiting until the last bump on my head disappears, in order to
present me to the king, who I am told cannot endure the sight of
a bump."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Aramis is still in
Paris, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Whereabouts is he,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At
Fontainebleau."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Alone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"With M.
Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But do you happen to know one
thing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, tell it me,
and then I shall know."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then, I
think Aramis is forgetting you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you really
think so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; for at
Fontainebleau yonder, you must know, they are laughing, dancing,
banqueting, and drawing the corks of M. de Mazarin's wine in fine
style.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you aware that
they have a ballet every evening there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The deuce they
have!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I assure you that
your dear Aramis is forgetting you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, that is not
at all unlikely, and I have myself thought so sometimes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Unless he is
playing you a trick, the sly fellow!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You know that
Aramis is as sly as a fox."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, but to play
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me</i> a trick - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Listen: in the
first place, he puts you under a sort of sequestration."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He sequestrates
me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you mean to say I
am sequestrated?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I think so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I wish you would
have the goodness to prove that to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nothing
easier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you ever go
out?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you ever ride
on horseback?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Are your friends
allowed to come and see you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Never."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well, then;
never to go out, never to ride on horseback, never to be allowed
to see your friends, that is called being sequestrated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But why should
Aramis sequestrate me?" inquired Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Come," said
D'Artagnan, "be frank, Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As gold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It was Aramis who
drew the plan of the fortifications at Belle-Isle, was it
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos colored as
he said, "Yes; but that was all he did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly, and my
own opinion is that it was no very great affair after all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is mine,
too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good; I am
delighted we are of the same opinion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He never even came
to Belle-Isle," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There now, you
see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It was I who went
to Vannes, as you may have seen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Say rather, as I
did see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, that is
precisely the state of the case, my dear Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis, who only drew the plans,
wishes to pass himself off as the engineer, whilst you, who,
stone by stone, built the wall, the citadel, and the bastions, he
wishes to reduce to the rank of a mere builder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"By builder, you
mean mason, perhaps?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Mason; the very
word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Plasterer, in
fact?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Hodman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, oh! my dear
Aramis, you seem to think you are only five and twenty years of
age still."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, and that is
not all, for believes you are fifty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I should have
amazingly liked to have seen him at work."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A fellow who has
got the gout?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Who has lost three
of his teeth?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Four."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"While I, look at
mine."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Porthos,
opening his large mouth very wide, displayed two rows of teeth
not quite as white as snow, but even, hard, and sound as
ivory.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You can hardly
believe, Porthos," said D'Artagnan, "what a fancy the king has
for good teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yours
decide me; I will present you to the king myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why not?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you think I have less
credit at court than Aramis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you think I
have the slightest pretensions upon the fortifications at
Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly
not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is your own
interest alone which would induce me to do it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I don't doubt it
in the least."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, I am the
intimate friend of the king; and a proof of that is, that
whenever there is anything disagreeable to tell him, it is I who
have to do it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But, dear
D'Artagnan, if you present me - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well!"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Aramis will
be angry."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "With
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, with <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Bah! whether he or
I present you, since you are to be presented, what does it
matter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"They were going to
get me some clothes made."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your own are
splendid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! those I had
ordered were far more beautiful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Take care: the
king likes simplicity."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In that case, I
will be simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But what
will M. Fouquet say, when he learns that I have left?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Are you a
prisoner, then, on parole?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, not quite
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I promised him
I would not leave without letting him know."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Wait a minute, we
shall return to that presently.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have you anything to do here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I, nothing:
nothing of any importance, at least."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Unless, indeed,
you are Aramis's representative for something of importance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"By no means."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What I tell you -
pray, understand that - is out of interest for you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I suppose, for instance, that you
are commissioned to send messages and letters to him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! letters
-yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I send certain
letters to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To
Fontainebleau."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you any
letters, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nay, let me
speak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have you any
letters, I say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have just
received one for him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Interesting?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I suppose so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You do not read
them, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am not at all
curious," said Porthos, as he drew out of his pocket the
soldier's letter which Porthos had not read, but D'Artagnan
had.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you know what
to do with it?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of course; do as I
always do, send it to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why not?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Keep it, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Did they not tell
you that this letter was important?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very
important."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, you must
take it yourself to Fontainebleau."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To Aramis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Yes."<br>
"Very good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"And since the king
is there - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"You will profit by
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"I shall profit by
the opportunity to present you to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan, there is no one like you
for expedients."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Therefore, instead
of forwarding to our friend any messages, which may or may not be
faithfully delivered, we will ourselves be the bearers of the
letter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I had never even
thought of that, and yet it is simple enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And therefore,
because it is urgent, Porthos, we ought to set off at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In fact," said
Porthos, "the sooner we set off the less chance there is of
Aramis's letter being delayed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Porthos, your
reasoning is always accurate, and, in your case, logic seems to
serve as an auxiliary to the imagination."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you think so?"
said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is the result
of your hard reading," replied D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "So come along, let us be off."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But," said
Porthos, "my promise to M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Which?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not to leave
Saint-Mand&eacute; without telling him of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos," said D'Artagnan, "how very
young you still are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In what way?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are going to
Fontainebleau, are you not, where you will find M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Probably in the
king's palace?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," repeated
Porthos, with an air full of majesty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, you will
accost him with these words: 'M. Fouquet, I have the honor to
inform you that I have just left Saint-Mand&eacute;.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And," said
Porthos, with the same majestic mien, "seeing me at Fontainebleau
at the king's, M. Fouquet will not be able to tell me I am not
speaking the truth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My dear Porthos, I
was just on the point of opening my lips to make the same remark,
but you anticipate me in everything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos, how fortunately you are
gifted!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Years have made
not the slightest impression on you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not over-much,
certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Then there is
nothing more to say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I think not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"All your scruples
are removed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quite so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In that case I
shall carry you off with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly; and I
will go and get my horse saddled."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You have horses
here, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have five."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You had them sent
from Pierrefonds, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, M. Fouquet
gave them to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My dear Porthos,
we shall not want five horses for two persons; besides, I have
already three in Paris, which would make eight, and that will be
too many."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It would not be
too many if I had some of my servants here; but, alas! I have not
got them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you regret
them, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I regret
Mousqueton; I miss Mousqueton."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What a
good-hearted fellow you are, Porthos," said D'Artagnan; "but the
best thing you can do is to leave your horses here, as you have
left Mousqueton out yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because, by and
by, it might turn out a very good thing if M. Fouquet had never
given you anything at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I don't understand
you," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is not
necessary you should understand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But yet - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will explain to
you later, Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I'll wager it is
some piece of policy or other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And of the most
subtle character," returned D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos nodded his
head at this word policy; then, after a moment's reflection, he
added, "I confess, D'Artagnan, that I am no politician."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I know that
well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! no one knows
what you told me yourself, you, the bravest of the brave."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What did I tell
you, Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That every man has
his day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You told me so,
and I have experienced it myself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There are certain days when one
feels less pleasure than others in exposing one's self to a
bullet or a sword-thrust."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly my own
idea."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And mine, too,
although I can hardly believe in blows or thrusts that kill
outright."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The deuce! and yet
you have killed a few in your time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; but I have
never been killed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your reason is a
very good one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Therefore, I do
not believe I shall ever die from a thrust of a sword or a
gun-shot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In that case,
then, you are afraid of nothing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! water, perhaps?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I swim like an otter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of a quartan
fever, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have never had
one yet, and I don't believe I ever shall; but there is one thing
I will admit," and Porthos dropped his voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is that?"
asked D'Artagnan, adopting the same tone of voice as Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I must confess,"
repeated Porthos, "that I am horribly afraid of politics."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah, bah!"
exclaimed D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Upon my word, it's
true," said Porthos, in a stentorian voice.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I have seen his eminence Monsieur
le Cardinal de Richelieu, and his eminence Monsieur le Cardinal
de Mazarin; the one was a red politician, the other a black
politician; I never felt very much more satisfied with the one
than with the other; the first struck off the heads of M. de
Marillac, M. de Thou, M. de Cinq-Mars, M. Ch&acirc;lais, M. de
Bouteville, and M. de Montmorency; the second got a whole crowd
of Frondeurs cut in pieces, and we belonged to them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"On the contrary,
we did not belong to them," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! indeed, yes;
for if I unsheathed my sword for the cardinal, I struck it for
the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My good
Porthos!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, I have
done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My dread of
politics is such, that if there is any question of politics in
the matter, I should greatly prefer to return to
Pierrefonds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You would be quite
right, if that were the case.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But with me, my dear Porthos, no
politics at all, that is quite clear.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have labored hard in fortifying
Belle-Isle; the king wished to know the name of the clever
engineer under whose directions the works were carried out; you
are modest, as all men of true genius are; perhaps Aramis wishes
to put you under a bushel.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I happen to seize hold of you; I
make it known who you are; I produce you; the king rewards you;
and that is the only policy I have to do with."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And the only one I
will have to do with either," said Porthos, holding out his hand
to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>But D'Artagnan knew
Porthos's grasp; he knew that, once imprisoned within the baron's
five fingers, no hand ever left it without being
half-crushed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
therefore held out, not his hand, but his fist, and Porthos did
not even perceive the difference.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The servants talked a little with
each other in an undertone, and whispered a few words, which
D'Artagnan understood, but which he took very good care not to
let Porthos understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Our friend," he said to himself, "was really and truly Aramis's
prisoner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us now see
what the result will be of the liberation of the captive."</p>

D</span>'Artagnan and Porthos returned on foot, as D'Artagnan had
set out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When D'Artagnan,
as he entered the shop of the Pilon d'Or, announced to Planchet
that M. du Vallon would be one of the privileged travelers, and
as the plume in Porthos's hat made the wooden candles suspended
over the front jingle together, a melancholy presentiment seemed
to eclipse the delight Planchet had promised himself for the
morrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the grocer
had a heart of gold, ever mindful of the good old times - a trait
that carries youth into old age.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So Planchet, notwithstanding a sort
of internal shiver, checked as soon as experienced, received
Porthos with respect, mingled with the tenderest cordiality.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos, who was a little cold
and stiff in his manners at first, on account of the social
difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer,
soon began to soften when he perceived so much good-feeling and
so many kind attentions in Planchet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was particularly touched by the
liberty which was permitted him to plunge his great palms into
the boxes of dried fruits and preserves, into the sacks of nuts
and almonds, and into the drawers full of sweetmeats.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So that, notwithstanding Planchet's
pressing invitations to go upstairs to the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entresol</i>, he chose as his
favorite seat, during the evening which he had to spend at
Planchet's house, the shop itself, where his fingers could always
fish up whatever his nose detected.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The delicious figs from Provence,
filberts from the forest, Tours plums, were subjects of his
uninterrupted attention for five consecutive hours.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His teeth, like millstones, cracked
heaps of nuts, the shells of which were scattered all over the
floor, where they were trampled by every one who went in and out
of the shop; Porthos pulled from the stalk with his lips, at one
mouthful, bunches of the rich Muscatel raisins with their
beautiful bloom, half a pound of which passed at one gulp from
his mouth to his stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
In one of the corners of the shop, Planchet's assistants, huddled
together, looked at each other without venturing to open their
lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They did not know
who Porthos was, for they had never seen him before.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The race of those Titans who had
worn the cuirasses of Hugh Capet, Philip Augustus, and Francis I.
had already begun to disappear.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They could hardly help thinking he
might be the ogre of the fairy tale, who was going to turn the
whole contents of Planchet's shop into his insatiable stomach,
and that, too, without in the slightest degree displacing the
barrels and chests that were in it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Cracking, munching, chewing,
nibbling, sucking, and swallowing, Porthos occasionally said to
the grocer:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do a very good
business here, friend Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He will very soon have
none at all to do, if this sort of thing continues," grumbled the
foreman, who had Planchet's word that he should be his
successor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the midst
of his despair, he approached Porthos, who blocked up the whole
of the passage leading from the back shop to the shop
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He hoped that
Porthos would rise and that this movement would distract his
devouring ideas.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you want, my
man?" asked Porthos, affably.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should like to pass
you, monsieur, if it is not troubling you too much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well," said
Porthos, "it does not trouble me in the least."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>At the same moment
he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband, lifted him off
the ground, and placed him very gently on the other side, smiling
all the while with the same affable expression.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as Porthos had placed him on
the ground, the lad's legs so shook under him that he fell back
upon some sacks of corks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But noticing the giant's gentleness of manner, he ventured again,
and said:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah, monsieur! pray
be careful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What about?"
inquired Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are positively
putting a fiery furnace into your body."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How is that, my
good fellow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"All those things
are very heating to the system!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Which?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Raisins, nuts, and
almonds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; but if
raisins, nuts, and almonds are heating - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There is no doubt
at all of it, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Honey is very
cooling," said Porthos, stretching out his hand toward a small
barrel of honey which was open, and he plunged the scoop with
which the wants of the customers were supplied into it, and
swallowed a good half-pound at one gulp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I must trouble you
for some water now, my man," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In a pail,
monsieur?" asked the lad, simply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, in a
water-bottle; that will be quite enough;" and raising the bottle
to his mouth, as a trumpeter does his trumpet, he emptied the
bottle at a single draught.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Planchet was
agitated in every fibre of propriety and self-esteem.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, a worthy representative of
the hospitality which prevailed in early days, he feigned to be
talking very earnestly with D'Artagnan, and incessantly repeated:
- "Ah! monsieur, what a happiness! what an honor!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What time shall we
have supper, Planchet?" inquired Porthos, "I feel hungry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The foreman clasped
his hands together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
two others got under the counters, fearing Porthos might have a
taste for human flesh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"We shall only take
a sort of snack here," said D'Artagnan; "and when we get to
Planchet's country-seat, we will have supper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah, ah! so we are
going to your country-house, Planchet," said Porthos; "so much
the better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You overwhelm me,
monsieur le baron."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The "monsieur le
baron" had a great effect upon the men, who detected a personage
of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This title, too, reassured
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They had never
heard that an ogre was ever called "monsieur le baron".</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will take a few
biscuits to eat on the road," said Porthos, carelessly; and he
emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge pocket of
his doublet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My shop is saved!"
exclaimed Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, as the cheese
was," whispered the foreman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What cheese?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The Dutch cheese,
inside which a rat had made his way, and we found only the rind
left."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Planchet looked all
round his shop, and observing the different articles which had
escaped Porthos's teeth, he found the comparison somewhat
exaggerated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The foreman,
who remarked what was passing in his master's mind, said, "Take
care; he is not gone yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you any fruit
here?" said Porthos, as he went upstairs to the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>entresol</i>, where it had just
been announced that some refreshment was prepared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Alas!" thought the
grocer, addressing a look at D'Artagnan full of entreaty, which
the latter half understood.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>As soon as they had
finished eating they set off.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was late when the three riders,
who had left Paris about six in the evening, arrived at
Fontainebleau.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
journey passed very agreeably.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos took a fancy to Planchet's
society, because the latter was very respectful in his manners,
and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows, his woods,
and his rabbit-warrens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Porthos had all the taste and pride of a landed proprietor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When D'Artagnan saw his two
companions in earnest conversation, he took the opposite side of
the road, and letting his bridle drop upon his horse's neck,
separated himself from the whole world, as he had done from
Porthos and from Planchet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The moon shone softly through the
foliage of the forest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The breezes of the open country rose deliciously perfumed to the
horse's nostrils, and they snorted and pranced along
delightedly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos and
Planchet began to talk about hay-crops.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet admitted to Porthos that in
the advanced years of his life, he had certainly neglected
agricultural pursuits for commerce, but that his childhood had
been passed in Picardy in the beautiful meadows where the grass
grew as high as the knees, and where he had played under the
green apple-trees covered with red-cheeked fruit; he went on to
say, that he had solemnly promised himself that as soon as he
should have made his fortune, he would return to nature, and end
his days, as he had begun them, as near as he possibly could to
the earth itself, where all men must sleep at last.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Eh, eh!" said
Porthos; "in that case, my dear Monsieur Planchet, your
retirement is not far distant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, you seem to
be in the way of making your fortune very soon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, we are
getting on pretty well, I must admit," replied Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Come, tell me what
is the extent of your ambition, and what is the amount you intend
to retire upon?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There is one
circumstance, monsieur," said Planchet, without answering the
question, "which occasions me a good deal of anxiety."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is it?"
inquired Porthos, looking all round him as if in search of the
circumstance that annoyed Planchet, and desirous of freeing him
from it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, formerly,"
said the grocer, "you used to call me Planchet quite short, and
you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar manner
than you do now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly,
certainly, I should have said so formerly," replied the
good-natured Porthos, with an embarrassment full of delicacy;
"but formerly - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Formerly I was M.
d'Artagnan's lackey; is not that what you mean?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well if I am not
quite his lackey, I am as much as ever I was his devoted servant;
and more than that, since that time - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well,
Planchet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Since that time, I
have had the honor of being in partnership with him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, oh!" said
Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What, has
D'Artagnan gone into the grocery business?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, no," said
D'Artagnan, whom these words had drawn out of his reverie, and
who entered into the conversation with that readiness and
rapidity which distinguished every operation of his mind and
body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It was not
D'Artagnan who entered into the grocery business, but Planchet
who entered into a political affair with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," said
Planchet, with mingled pride and satisfaction, "we transacted a
little business which brought me in a hundred thousand francs and
M. d'Artagnan two hundred thousand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, oh!" said
Porthos, with admiration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So that, monsieur
le baron," continued the grocer, "I again beg you to be kind
enough to call me Planchet, as you used to do; and to speak to me
as familiarly as in old times.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You cannot possibly imagine the
pleasure it would give me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If that be the
case, my dear Planchet, I will do so, certainly," replied
Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And as he was
quite close to Planchet, he raised his hand, as if to strike him
on the shoulder, in token of friendly cordiality; but a fortunate
movement of the horse made him miss his aim, so that his hand
fell on the crupper of Planchet's horse, instead; which made the
animal's legs almost give way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan burst
out laughing, as he said, "Take care, Planchet; for if Porthos
begins to like you so much, he will caress you, and if he
caresses you he will knock you as flat as a pancake.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos is still as strong as every,
you know."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh," said
Planchet, "Mousqueton is not dead, and yet monsieur le baron is
very fond of him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly," said
Porthos, with a sigh which made all the three horses rear; "and I
was only saying, this very morning, to D'Artagnan, how much I
regretted him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But tell
me, Planchet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Thank you,
monsieur le baron, thank you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Good lad, good
lad!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How many acres of
park have you got?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of park?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; we will
reckon up the meadows presently, and the woods afterwards."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Whereabouts,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At your
ch&acirc;teau."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, monsieur le
baron, I have neither ch&acirc;teau, nor park, nor meadows, nor
woods."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What have you got,
then?" inquired Porthos, "and why do you call it a
country-seat?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I did not call it
a country-seat, monsieur le baron," replied Planchet, somewhat
humiliated, "but a country-box."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah, ah!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I understand.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are modest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, monsieur le
baron, I speak the plain truth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have rooms for a couple of
friends, that's all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But in that case,
whereabouts do your friends walk?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In the first
place, they can walk about the king's forest, which is very
beautiful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, I know the
forest is very fine," said Porthos; "nearly as beautiful as my
forest at Berry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Planchet opened his
eyes very wide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Have you
a forest of the same kind as the forest at Fontainebleau,
monsieur le baron?" he stammered out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; I have two,
indeed, but the one at Berry is my favorite."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why so?" asked
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because I don't
know where it ends; and, also, because it is full of
poachers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How can the
poachers make the forest so agreeable to you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because they hunt
my game, and I hunt them - which, in these peaceful times, is for
me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small scale."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>They had reached
this turn of conversation, when Planchet, looking up, perceived
the houses at the commencement of Fontainebleau, the lofty
outlines of which stood out strongly against the misty visage of
the heavens; whilst, rising above the compact and irregularly
formed mass of buildings, the pointed roofs of the ch&acirc;teau
were clearly visible, the slates of which glistened beneath the
light of the moon, like the scales of an immense fish.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Gentlemen," said Planchet, "I
have the honor to inform you that we have arrived at
Fontainebleau."</p>

T</span>he cavaliers looked up, and saw that what Planchet had
announced to them was true.<span style=

the street called the Rue de Lyon, on the opposite side of the
hostelry of the Beau Paon.<span style=

hawthorn, and wild hops formed an impenetrable fence, behind
which rose a white house, with a high tiled roof.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two of the windows, which were quite
dark, looked upon the street.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Between the two, a small door, with
a porch supported by a couple of pillars, formed the entrance to
the house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The door was
gained by a step raised a little from the ground.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet got off his horse, as if he
intended to knock at the door; but, on second thoughts, he took
hold of his horse by the bridle, and led it about thirty paces
further on, his two companions following him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then advanced about another
thirty paces, until he arrived at the door of a cart-house,
lighted by an iron grating; and, lifting up a wooden latch,
pushed open one of the folding-doors.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He entered first, leading his horse
after him by the bridle, into a small courtyard, where an odor
met them which revealed their close vicinity to a stable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "That smells all right," said
Porthos, loudly, getting off his horse, "and I almost begin to
think I am near my own cows at Pierrefonds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have only one cow,"
Planchet hastened to say modestly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And I have
thirty," said Porthos; "or rather, I don't exactly know how many
I have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>When the two
cavaliers had entered, Planchet fastened the door behind
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime,
D'Artagnan, who had dismounted with his usual agility, inhaled
the fresh perfumed air with the delight a Parisian feels at the
sight of green fields and fresh foliage, plucked a piece of
honeysuckle with one hand, and of sweet-briar with the
other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos clawed
hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into the
ground, and ate, or rather browsed upon them, shells and all: and
Planchet was busily engaged trying to wake up an old and infirm
peasant, who was fast asleep in a shed, lying on a bed of moss,
and dressed in an old stable suit of clothes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The peasant, recognizing Planchet,
called him "the master," to the grocer's great satisfaction.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Stable the horses well, old
fellow, and you shall have something good for yourself," said
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, yes; fine
animals they are too," said the peasant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh! they shall have as much as they
like."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Gently, gently, my
man," said D'Artagnan, "we are getting on a little too fast.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A few oats and a good bed -
nothing more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Some bran and
water for my horse," said Porthos, "for it is very warm, I
think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Don't be afraid,
gentlemen," replied Planchet; "Daddy Celestin is an old gendarme,
who fought at Ivry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
knows all about horses; so come into the house."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he led the way along a
well-sheltered walk, which crossed a kitchen-garden, then a small
paddock, and came out into a little garden behind the house, the
principal front of which, as we have already noticed, faced the
street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As they
approached, they could see, through two open windows on the
ground floor, which led into a sitting-room, the interior of
Planchet's residence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
This room, softly lighted by a lamp placed on the table, seemed,
from the end of the garden, like a smiling image of repose,
comfort, and happiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
In every direction where the rays of light fell, whether upon a
piece of old china, or upon an article of furniture shining from
excessive neatness, or upon the weapons hanging against the wall,
the soft light was softly reflected; and its rays seemed to
linger everywhere upon something or another, agreeable to the
eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lamp which
lighted the room, whilst the foliage of jasmine and climbing
roses hung in masses from the window-frames, splendidly
illuminated a damask table-cloth as white as snow.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The table was laid for two
persons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Amber-colored
wine sparkled in a long cut-glass bottle; and a large jug of blue
china, with a silver lid, was filled with foaming cider.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Near the table, in a
high-backed armchair, reclined, fast asleep, a woman of about
thirty years of age, her face the very picture of health and
freshness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon her knees
lay a large cat, with her paws folded under her, and her eyes
half-closed, purring in that significant manner which, according
to feline habits, indicates perfect contentment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two friends paused before the
window in complete amazement, while Planchet, perceiving their
astonishment, was in no little degree secretly delighted at
it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet, you rascal," said
D'Artagnan, "I now understand your absences."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, oh! there is
some white linen!" said Porthos, in his turn, in a voice of
thunder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the sound of
this gigantic voice, the cat took flight, the housekeeper woke up
with a start, and Planchet, assuming a gracious air, introduced
his two companions into the room, where the table was already
laid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Permit me, my
dear," he said, "to present to you Monsieur le Chevalier
d'Artagnan, my patron."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan took the lady's hand in his in the most courteous
manner, and with precisely the same chivalrous air as he would
have taken Madame's.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur le Baron
du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds," added Planchet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos bowed with a reverence
which Anne of Austria would have approved of.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>It was then
Planchet's turn, and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady in
question, not, however, until he had made a sign as if requesting
D'Artagnan's and Porthos's permission, a permission as a matter
of course frankly conceded.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan complimented Planchet,
and said, "You are indeed a man who knows how to make life
agreeable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Life, monsieur,"
said Planchet, laughing, "is capital which a man ought to invest
as sensibly as he possibly can."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And you get very
good interest for yours," said Porthos, with a burst of laughter
like a peal of thunder.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Planchet turned to
his housekeeper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You
have before you," he said to her, "the two gentlemen who
influenced the greatest, gayest, grandest portion of my
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have spoken to
you about them both very frequently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And about two
others as well," said the lady, with a very decided Flemish
accent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Madame is Dutch?"
inquired D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Porthos curled his mustache, a circumstance which was not lost
upon D'Artagnan, who noticed everything.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am from
Antwerp," said the lady.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And her name is
Madame Getcher," said Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You should not
call her madame," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why not?" asked
Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because it would
make her seem older every time you call her so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, I call her
Tr&uuml;chen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And a very pretty
name too," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Tr&uuml;chen,"
said Planchet, "came to me from Flanders with her virtue and two
thousand florins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She ran
away from a brute of a husband who was in the habit of beating
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Being myself a
Picard born, I was always very fond of the Artesian women, and it
is only a step from Artois to Flanders; she came crying bitterly
to her godfather, my predecessor in the Rue des Lombards; she
placed her two thousand florins in my establishment, which I have
turned to very good account, and which have brought her in ten
thousand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Bravo,
Planchet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"She is free and
well off; she has a cow, a maid servant and old Celestin at her
orders; she mends my linen, knits my winter stockings; she only
sees me every fortnight, and seems to make herself in all things
tolerably happy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And indeed,
gentlemen, I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>am</i> very
happy and comfortable," said Tr&uuml;chen, with perfect
ingenuousness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos began to
curl the other side of his mustache.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The deuce," thought D'Artagnan,
"can Porthos have any intentions in that quarter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>In the meantime
Tr&uuml;chen had set her cook to work, had laid the table for two
more, and covered it with every possible delicacy that could
convert a light supper into a substantial meal, a meal into a
regular feast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fresh
butter, salt beef, anchovies, tunny, a shopful of Planchet's
commodities, fowls, vegetables, salad, fish from the pond and the
river, game from the forest - all the produce, in fact, of the
province.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Moreover,
Planchet returned from the cellar, laden with ten bottles of
wine, the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick
coating of dust which covered them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos's heart began to expand as
he said, "I am hungry," and he sat himself beside Madame
Tr&uuml;chen, whom he looked at in the most killing manner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan seated himself on
the other side of her, while Planchet, discreetly and full of
delight, took his seat opposite.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do not trouble
yourselves," he said, "if Tr&uuml;chen should leave the table now
and then during supper; for she will have to look after your
bedrooms."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>In fact, the
housekeeper made her escape quite frequently, and they could
hear, on the first floor above them, the creaking of the wooden
bedsteads and the rolling of the castors on the floor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While this was going on, the
three men, Porthos especially, ate and drank gloriously, - it was
wonderful to see them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The ten full bottles were ten empty one by the time Tr&uuml;chen
returned with the cheese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan still preserved his dignity and self-possession, but
Porthos had lost a portion of his; and the mirth soon began to
grow somewhat uproarious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan recommended a new descent into the cellar, and, as
Planchet no longer walked with the steadiness of a well-trained
foot-soldier, the captain of the musketeers proposed to accompany
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They set off,
humming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be
listening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tr&uuml;chen
remained behind at table with Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While the two wine-bibbers were
looking behind the firewood for what they wanted, a sharp report
was heard like the impact of a pair of lips on a lady's
cheek.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Porthos fancies
himself at La Rochelle," thought D'Artagnan, as they returned
freighted with bottles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Planchet was singing so loudly that he was incapable of noticing
anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan,
whom nothing ever escaped, remarked how much redder
Tr&uuml;chen's left cheek was than her right.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos was sitting on
Tr&uuml;chen's left, and was curling with both his hands both
sides of his mustache at once, and Tr&uuml;chen was looking at
him with a most bewitching smile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sparkling wine of Anjou very
soon produced a remarkable effect upon the three companions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan had hardly strength
enough left to take a candlestick to light Planchet up his own
staircase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet was
pulling Porthos along, who was following Tr&uuml;chen, who was
herself jovial enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
was D'Artagnan who found out the rooms and the beds.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos threw himself into the one
destined for him, after his friend had undressed him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan got into his own bed,
saying to himself, "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had made up my mind never to touch
that light-colored wine, which brings my early camp days back
again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fie! fie! if my
musketeers were only to see their captain in such a state."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And drawing the curtains of
his bed, he added, "Fortunately enough, though, they will not see
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The country is
very amusing," said Porthos, stretching out his legs, which
passed through the wooden footboard, and made a tremendous crash,
of which, however, no one in the house was capable of taking the
slightest notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By two
o'clock in the morning every one was fast asleep.</p>

T</span>he next morning found the three heroes sleeping
soundly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tr&uuml;chen had
closed the outside blinds to keep the first rays of the sun from
the leaden-lidded eyes of her guests, like a kind, good
housekeeper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was still
perfectly dark, then, beneath Porthos's curtains and under
Planchet's canopy, when D'Artagnan, awakened by an indiscreet ray
of light which made its way through a peek-hole in the shutters,
jumped hastily out of bed, as if he wished to be the first at a
forlorn hope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He took by
assault Porthos's room, which was next to his own.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The worthy Porthos was sleeping with
a noise like distant thunder; in the dim obscurity of the room
his gigantic frame was prominently displayed, and his swollen
fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan awoke Porthos, who rubbed
his eyes in a tolerably good humor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime Planchet was
dressing himself, and met at their bedroom doors his two guests,
who were still somewhat unsteady from their previous evening's
entertainment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although
it was yet very early, the whole household was already up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cook was mercilessly
slaughtering in the poultry-yard; Celestin was gathering white
cherries in the garden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Porthos, brisk and lively as ever, held out his hand to
Planchet's, and D'Artagnan requested permission to embrace Madame
Tr&uuml;chen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The latter,
to show that she bore no ill-will, approached Porthos, upon whom
she conferred the same favor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos embraced Madame
Tr&uuml;chen, heaving an enormous sigh.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet took both his friends by
the hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am going to show you
over the house," he said; "when we arrived last night it was as
dark as an oven, and we were unable to see anything; but in broad
daylight, everything looks different, and you will be satisfied,
I hope."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If we begin by the view
you have here," said D'Artagnan, "that charms me beyond
everything; I have always lived in royal mansions, you know, and
royal personages have tolerably sound ideas upon the selection of
points of view."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am a great stickler
for a good view myself," said Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "At my Ch&acirc;teau de Pierrefonds,
I have had four avenues laid out, and at the end of each is a
landscape of an altogether different character from the
others."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You shall see <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i> prospect," said Planchet; and
he led his two guests to a window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said D'Artagnan,
"this is the Rue de Lyon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I have two windows
on this side, a paltry, insignificant view, for there is always
that bustling and noisy inn, which is a very disagreeable
neighbor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had four
windows here, but I bricked up two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us go on," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> They entered a corridor
leading to the bedrooms, and Planchet pushed open the outside
blinds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hollo! what is that out
yonder?" said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The forest," said
Planchet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It is the
horizon, - a thick line of green, which is yellow in the spring,
green in the summer, red in the autumn, and white in the
winter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All very well, but it
is like a curtain, which prevents one seeing a greater
distance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said Planchet;
"still, one can see, at all events, everything that
intervenes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, the open country,"
said Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But what
is that I see out there, - crosses and stones?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, that is the
cemetery," exclaimed D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely," said
Planchet; "I assure you it is very curious.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hardly a day passes that some one is
not buried there; for Fontainebleau is by no means an
inconsiderable place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Sometimes we see young girls clothed in white carrying banners;
at others, some of the town-council, or rich citizens, with
choristers and all the parish authorities; and then, too, we see
some of the officers of the king's household."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should not like
that," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is not much
amusement in it, at all events," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I assure you it
encourages religious thoughts," replied Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, I don't deny
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," continued
Planchet, "we must all die one day or another, and I once met
with a maxim somewhere which I have remembered, that the thought
of death is a thought that will do us all good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am far from saying
the contrary," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," objected
D'Artagnan, "the thought of green fields, flowers, rivers, blue
horizons, extensive and boundless plains, is no likely to do us
good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If I had any, I should
be far from rejecting them," said Planchet; "but possessing only
this little cemetery, full of flowers, so moss-grown, shady, and
quiet, I am contented with it, and I think of those who live in
town, in the Rue des Lombards, for instance, and who have to
listen to the rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every
day, and to the soulless tramp, tramp, tramp of a hundred and
fifty thousand foot-passengers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But living," said
Porthos; "living, remember that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is exactly the
reason," said Planchet, timidly, "why I feel it does me good to
contemplate a few dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Upon my word," said
D'Artagnan, "that fellow Planchet is born a philosopher as well
as a grocer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said
Planchet, "I am one of those good-humored sort of men whom Heaven
created for the purpose of living a certain span of days, and of
considering all good they meet with during their transitory stay
on earth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan sat down
close to the window, and as there seemed to be something
substantial in Planchet's philosophy, he mused over it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah!" exclaimed
Planchet, "if I am not mistaken, we are going to have a
representation now, for I think I heard something like
chanting."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said D'Artagnan,
"I hear singing too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, it is only a burial
of a very poor description," said Planchet, disdainfully; "the
officiating priest, the beadle, and only one chorister boy,
nothing more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You

have been of very high rank."</p>

following the coffin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

see a man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

wrapped in a cloak," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It's not worth looking
at," said Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I find it interesting,"
said D'Artagnan, leaning on the window-sill.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come, come, you are
beginning to take a fancy to the place already," said Planchet,
delightedly; "it is exactly my own case.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was so melancholy at first that I
could do nothing but make the sign of the cross all day, and the
chants were like so many nails being driven into my head; but
now, they lull me to sleep, and no bird I have ever seen or heard
can sing better than those which are to be met with in this
cemetery."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said Porthos,
"this is beginning to get a little dull for me, and I prefer
going downstairs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet with one bound
was beside his guest, whom he offered to lead into the
garden.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What!" said Porthos to
D'Artagnan, as he turned round, "are you going to remain
here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I will join you
presently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>              </span> "Well, M.
D'Artagnan is right, after all," said Planchet: "are they
beginning to bury yet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! yes, the
grave-digger is waiting until the cords are fastened round the
bier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, see, a woman
has just entered the cemetery at the other end."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes, my dear
Planchet," said D'Artagnan, quickly, "leave me, leave me; I feel
I am beginning already to be much comforted by my meditations, so
do not interrupt me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet left, and
D'Artagnan remained, devouring with his eager gaze from behind
the half-closed blinds what was taking place just before
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two bearers of
the corpse had unfastened the straps by which they carried the
litter, and were letting their burden glide gently into the open
grave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At a few paces
distant, the man with the cloak wrapped round him, the only
spectator of this melancholy scene, was leaning with his back
against a large cypress-tree, and kept his face and person
entirely concealed from the grave-diggers and the priests; the
corpse was buried in five minutes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The grave having been filled up, the
priests turned away, and the grave-digger having addressed a few
words to them, followed them as they moved away.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The man in the mantle bowed as they
passed him, and put a piece of gold into the grave-digger's
hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=

"it is Aramis himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis, in fact,
remained alone, on that side at least; for hardly had he turned
his head when a woman's footsteps, and the rustling of her dress,
were heard in the path close to him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He immediately turned round, and
took off his hat with the most ceremonious respect; he led the
lady under the shelter of some walnut and lime trees, which
overshadowed a magnificent tomb.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! who would have
thought it," said D'Artagnan; "the bishop of Vannes at a
rendezvous!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He is still
the same Abb&eacute; Aramis as he was at Noisy-le-Sec.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes," he added, after a pause;
"but as it is in a cemetery, the rendezvous is sacred."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But he almost laughed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The conversation lasted
for fully half an hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan could not see the lady's face, for she kept her back
turned towards him; but he saw perfectly well, by the erect
attitude of both the speakers, by their gestures, by the measured
and careful manner with which they glanced at each other, either
by way of attack or defense, that they must be conversing about
any other subject than of love.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the end of the conversation the
lady rose, and bowed profoundly to Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, oh," said
D'Artagnan; "this rendezvous finishes like one of a very tender
nature though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
cavalier kneels at the beginning, the young lady by and by gets
tamed down, and then it is she who has to supplicate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Who is this lady?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I would give anything to
ascertain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This seemed impossible,
however, for Aramis was the first to leave; the lady carefully
concealed her head and face, and then immediately departed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan could hold out no
longer; he ran to the window which looked out on the Rue de Lyon,
and saw Aramis entering the inn.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lady was proceeding in quite an
opposite direction, and seemed, in fact, to be about to rejoin an
equipage, consisting of two led horses and a carriage, which he
could see standing close to the borders of the forest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was walking slowly, her
head bent down, absorbed in the deepest meditation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mordioux!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mordioux!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I must and will learn who that woman
is," said the musketeer again; and then, without further
deliberation, he set off in pursuit of her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As he was going along, he tried to
think how he could possibly contrive to make her raise her
veil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "She is not young,"
he said, "and is a woman of high rank in society.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I ought to know that figure and
peculiar style of walk."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
As he ran, the sound of his spurs and of his boots upon the hard
ground of the street made a strange jingling noise; a fortunate
circumstance in itself, which he was far from reckoning
upon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The noise disturbed
the lady; she seemed to fancy she was being either followed or
pursued, which was indeed the case, and turned round.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan started as if he had
received a charge of small shot in his legs, and then turning
suddenly round as if he were going back the same way he had come,
he murmured, "Madame de Chevreuse!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan would not go home until
he had learnt everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He asked Celestin to inquire of the grave-digger whose body it
was they had buried that morning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A poor Franciscan
mendicant friar," replied the latter, "who had not even a dog to
love him in this world, and to accompany him to his last
resting-place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If that were really the
case," thought D'Artagnan, "we should not have found Aramis
present at his funeral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The bishop of Vannes is not precisely a dog as far as devotion
goes: his scent, however, is quite as keen, I admit."</p>

T</span>here was good living in Planchet's house.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos broke a ladder and two
cherry-trees, stripped the raspberry-bushes, and was only unable
to succeed in reaching the strawberry-beds on account, as he
said, of his belt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Tr&uuml;chen, who had become quite sociable with the giant, said
that it was not the belt so much as his corporation; and Porthos,
in a state of the highest delight, embraced Tr&uuml;chen, who
gathered him a pailful of the strawberries, and made him eat them
out of her hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan, who arrived in the midst of these little innocent
flirtations, scolded Porthos for his indolence, and silently
pitied Planchet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos
breakfasted with a very good appetite, and when he had finished,
he said, looking at Tr&uuml;chen, "I could make myself very happy
here."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tr&uuml;chen
smiled at his remark, and so did Planchet, but not without
embarrassment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

he inquired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no; you are a
noble-hearted fellow, but your house is very small.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such a house, with half a dozen
acres of land, would be fit for a king, and make him very happy,
too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But you were not
born a great lord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No more was M.
Porthos," murmured Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But he has become so,
my good fellow; his income has been a hundred thousand francs a
year for the last twenty years, and for the last fifty years
Porthos has been the owner of a couple of fists and a backbone,
which are not to be matched throughout the whole realm of
France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos is a man
of the very greatest consequence compared to you, and&hellip;

fellow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! my goodness
gracious!" said Planchet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame Tr&uuml;chen is
an excellent person," continued D'Artagnan, "but keep her for
yourself, do you understand?" and he slapped him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Planchet at this moment
perceived Porthos and Tr&uuml;chen sitting close together in an
arbor; Tr&uuml;chen, with a grace of manner peculiarly Flemish,
was making a pair of earrings for Porthos out of a double cherry,
while Porthos was laughing as amorously as Samson in the company
of Delilah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet
pressed D'Artagnan's hand, and ran towards the arbor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We must do Porthos the justice to
say that he did not move as they approached, and, very likely, he
did not think he was doing any harm.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nor indeed did Tr&uuml;chen move
either, which rather put Planchet out; but he, too, had been so
accustomed to see fashionable folk in his shop, that he found no
difficulty in putting a good countenance on what seemed
disagreeable or rude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Planchet seized Porthos by the arm, and proposed to go and look
at the horses, but Porthos pretended he was tired.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet then suggested that the
Baron du Vallon should taste some noyeau of his own manufacture,
which was not to be equaled anywhere; an offer the baron
immediately accepted; and, in this way, Planchet managed to
engage his enemy's attention during the whole of the day, by dint
of sacrificing his cellar, in preference to his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>amour propre.</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two hours afterwards D'Artagnan
returned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Everything is
arranged," he said; "I saw his majesty at the very moment he was
setting off for the chase; the king expects us this evening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king expects <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me!</i>" cried Porthos,
drawing himself up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is
a sad thing to have to confess, but a man's heart is like an
ocean billow; for, from that very moment Porthos ceased to look
at Madame Tr&uuml;chen in that touching manner which had so
softened her heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Planchet encouraged these ambitious leanings as best as he
could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He talked over, or
rather gave exaggerated accounts of all the splendors of the last
reign, its battles, sieges, and grand court ceremonies.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He spoke of the luxurious
display which the English made; the prizes the three brave
companions carried off; and how D'Artagnan, who at the beginning
had been the humblest of the four, finished by becoming the
leader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He fired Porthos
with a generous feeling of enthusiasm by reminding him of his
early youth now passed away; he boasted as much as he could of
the moral life this great lord had led, and how religiously he
respected the ties of friendship; he was eloquent, and skillful
in his choice of subjects.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He tickled Porthos, frightened
Tr&uuml;chen, and made D'Artagnan think.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At six o'clock, the musketeer
ordered the horses to be brought round, and told Porthos to get
ready.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He thanked
Planchet for his kind hospitality, whispered a few words about a
post he might succeed in obtaining for him at court, which
immediately raised Planchet in Tr&uuml;chen's estimation, where
the poor grocer - so good, so generous, so devoted - had become
much lowered ever since the appearance and comparison with him of
the two great gentlemen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Such, however, is a woman's nature; they are anxious to possess
what they have not got, and disdain it as soon as it is
acquired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After having
rendered this service to his friend Planchet, D'Artagnan said in
a low tone of voice to Porthos: "That is a very beautiful ring
you have on your finger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is worth three
hundred pistoles," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame Tr&uuml;chen
will remember you better if you leave her that ring," replied
D'Artagnan, a suggestion which Porthos seemed to hesitate to
adopt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You think it is not
beautiful enough, perhaps," said the musketeer.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I understand your feelings; a great
lord such as you would not think of accepting the hospitality of
an old servant without paying him most handsomely for it: but I
am sure that Planchet is too good-hearted a fellow to remember
that you have an income of a hundred thousand francs a year."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have more than half a
mind," said Porthos, flattered by the remark, "to make Madame
Tr&uuml;chen a present of my little farm at Bracieux; it has
twelve acres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is too much, my good
Porthos, too much just at present&hellip;<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Keep it for a future occasion."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then took the ring off
Porthos's finger, and approaching Tr&uuml;chen, said to her: -
"Madame, monsieur le baron hardly knows how to entreat you, out
of your regard for him, to accept this little ring.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. du Vallon is one of the most
generous and discreet men of my acquaintance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He wished to offer you a farm that
he has at Bracieux, but I dissuaded him from it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said Tr&uuml;chen,
looking eagerly at the diamond.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur le baron!"
exclaimed Planchet, quite overcome.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My good friend,"
stammered out Porthos, delighted at having been so well
represented by D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These several exclamations, uttered
at the same moment, made quite a pathetic winding-up of a day
which might have finished in a very ridiculous manner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But D'Artagnan was there, and,
on every occasion, wheresoever D'Artagnan exercised any control,
matters ended only just in the very way he wished and
willed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There were
general embracings; Tr&uuml;chen, whom the baron's munificence
had restored to her proper position, very timidly, and blushing
all the while, presented her forehead to the great lord with whom
she had been on such very pretty terms the evening before.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Planchet himself was overcome
by a feeling of genuine humility.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Still, in the same generosity of
disposition, Porthos would have emptied his pockets into the
hands of the cook and of Celestin; but D'Artagnan stopped
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," he said, "it is
now my turn."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he gave
one pistole to the woman and two to the man; and the benedictions
which were showered down upon them would have rejoiced the heart
of Harpagon himself, and have rendered even him a prodigal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan made Planchet

Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, happily, I was
there," said D'Artagnan, "and presently it will be <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment Fouquet
addressed the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," he said, "I have
a favor to solicit of your majesty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. d'Herblay is not ambitious, but
he knows when he can be of service.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty needs a representative
at Rome, who would be able to exercise a powerful influence
there; may I request a cardinal's hat for M. d'Herblay?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king started.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I do not often solicit anything of
your majesty," said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is a reason,
certainly," replied the king, who always expressed any hesitation
he might have in that manner, and to which remark there was
nothing to say in reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet and Aramis
looked at each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king resumed: "M. d'Herblay can serve us equally well in France;
an archbishopric, for instance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," objected
Fouquet, with a grace of manner peculiarly his own, "your majesty
overwhelms M. d'Herblay; the archbishopric may, in your majesty's
extreme kindness, be conferred in addition to the hat; the one
does not exclude the other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king admired the
readiness which he displayed, and smiled, saying: "D'Artagnan
himself could not have answered better."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had no sooner pronounced the name
than D'Artagnan appeared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did your majesty call
me?" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis and Fouquet drew
back a step, as if they were about to retire.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will your majesty allow
me," said D'Artagnan quickly, as he led forward Porthos, "to
present to your majesty M. le Baron du Vallon, one of the bravest
gentlemen of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As soon as Aramis saw
Porthos, he turned as pale as death, while Fouquet clenched his
hands under his ruffles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan smiled blandly at both of them, while Porthos bowed,
visibly overcome before the royal presence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Porthos here?" murmured
Fouquet in Aramis's ear.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hush! deep treachery at
work," hissed the latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said D'Artagnan,
"it is more than six years ago I ought to have presented M. du
Vallon to your majesty; but certain men resemble stars, they move
not one inch unless their satellites accompany them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Pleiades are never disunited,
and that is the reason I have selected, for the purpose of
presenting him to you, the very moment when you would see M.
d'Herblay by his side."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis almost lost
countenance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He looked at
D'Artagnan with a proud, haughty air, as though willing to accept
the defiance the latter seemed to throw down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! these gentlemen are
good friends, then?" said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Excellent friends,
sire; the one can answer for the other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ask M. de Vannes now in what manner
Belle-Isle was fortified?"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet moved back a step.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Belle-Isle," said
Aramis, coldly, "was fortified by that gentleman," and he
indicated Porthos with his hand, who bowed a second time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis could not withhold his
admiration, though at the same time his suspicions were
aroused.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said D'Artagnan,
"but ask monsieur le baron whose assistance he had in carrying
the works out?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Aramis's," said
Porthos, frankly; and he pointed to the bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What the deuce does all
this mean?" thought the bishop, "and what sort of a termination
are we to expect to this comedy?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What!" exclaimed the
king, "is the cardinal's, I mean this bishop's, name <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Aramis?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nom de guerre</i>," said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My nickname," said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A truce to modesty!"
exclaimed D'Artagnan; "beneath the priest's robe, sire, is
concealed the most brilliant officer, a gentleman of the most
unparalleled intrepidity, and the wisest theologian in your
kingdom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis raised his
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And an engineer,
also, it appears," he said, admiring Aramis's calm, imperturbable
self-possession.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "An engineer for a
particular purpose, sire," said the latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My companion in the
musketeers, sire," said D'Artagnan, with great warmth of manner,
"the man who has more than a hundred times aided your father's
ministers by his advice - M. d'Herblay, in a word, who, with M.
du Vallon, myself, and M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re, who is
known to your majesty, formed that quartette which was a good
deal talked about during the late king's reign, and during your
majesty's minority."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And who fortified
Belle-Isle?" the king repeated, in a significant tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis advanced and
bowed: "In order to serve the son as I served the father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan looked very
narrowly at Aramis while he uttered these words, which displayed
so much true respect, so much warm devotion, such entire
frankness and sincerity, that even he, D'Artagnan, the eternal
doubter, he, the almost infallible in judgment, was deceived by
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A man who lies
cannot speak in such a tone as that," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis was overcome by
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "In that case," he
said to Fouquet, who anxiously awaited the result of this proof,
"the cardinal's hat is promised.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur d'Herblay, I pledge you my
honor that the first promotion shall be yours.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thank M. Fouquet for it."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert overheard these words;
they stung him to the quick, and he left the salon abruptly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And you, Monsieur du Vallon,"
said the king, "what have you to ask?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am truly pleased to have it in my
power to acknowledge the services of those who were faithful to
my father."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire - " began Porthos,
but he was unable to proceed with what he was going to say.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," exclaimed
D'Artagnan, "this worthy gentleman is utterly overpowered by your
majesty's presence, he who so valiantly sustained the looks and
the fire of a thousand foes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, knowing what his thoughts are,
I - who am more accustomed to gaze upon the sun - can translate
them: he needs nothing, absolutely nothing; his sole desire is to
have the happiness of gazing upon your majesty for a quarter of
an hour."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You shall sup with me
this evening," said the king, saluting Porthos with a gracious
smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos became crimson
from delight and pride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The king dismissed him, and D'Artagnan pushed him into the
adjoining apartment, after he had embraced him warmly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sit next to me at

you so much as he does now.<span style=

his getting the cardinal's hat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of course," said
Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "By the by, does
the king like his guests to eat much at his table?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

himself if you do," said D'Artagnan, "for he himself possesses a

A</span>ramis cleverly managed to effect a diversion for the
purpose of finding D'Artagnan and Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He came up to the latter, behind one
of the columns, and, as he pressed his hand, said, "So you have
escaped from my prison?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do not scold him," said
D'Artagnan; "it was I, dear Aramis, who set him free."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Aramis, looking at Porthos, "could you not have waited with a
little more patience?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan came to the
assistance of Porthos, who already began to breathe hard, in sore
perplexity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You see, you members of
the Church are great politicians; we mere soldiers come at once
to the point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The facts
are these: I went to pay Baisemeaux a visit - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis pricked up his
ears at this announcement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stay!" said Porthos;
"you make me remember that I have a letter from Baisemeaux for
you, Aramis."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Porthos
held out the bishop the letter we have already seen.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis begged to be allowed to read
it, and read it without D'Artagnan feeling in the slightest
degree embarrassed by the circumstance that he was so well
acquainted with the contents of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, Aramis's face was so
impenetrable, that D'Artagnan could not but admire him more than
ever; after he had read it, he put the letter into his pocket
with the calmest possible air.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You were saying,
captain?" he observed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was saying,"
continued the musketeer, "that I had gone to pay Baisemeaux a
visit on his majesty's service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

service?" said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said D'Artagnan,
"and, naturally enough, we talked about you and our friends.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I must say that Baisemeaux
received me coldly; so I soon took my leave of him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As I was returning, a soldier
accosted me, and said (no doubt as he recognized me,
notwithstanding I was in private clothes), 'Captain, will you be
good enough to read me the name written on this envelope?' and I
read, 'To Monsieur du Vallon, at M. Fouquet's house,
Saint-Mand&eacute;.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
deuce, I said to myself, Porthos has not returned, then, as I
fancied, to Bell-Isle, or to Pierrefonds, but is at M. Fouquet's
house, at Saint-Mand&eacute;; and as M. Fouquet is not at
Saint-Mand&eacute;, Porthos must be quite alone, or, at all
events, with Aramis; I will go and see Porthos, and I accordingly
went to see Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good," said
Aramis, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that," said Porthos.</p>

Fontainebleau?" inquired Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

cemetery," said Porthos, thoughtlessly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

'near the cemetery?'" said Aramis, suspiciously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

musketeer, "since there is to be a squabble, let us take
advantage of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Planchet

morning - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, this morning we

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Porthos, and when he had squeezed all the juice out of this
enormous lemon, he threw the peel aside.<span style=

that Aramis had become so clever an engineer as to be able to
fortify like Polybius, or Archimedes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And
Porthos, too?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I did not divine that
Aramis was an engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
was only able to guess that Porthos might have become one.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is a saying, one becomes
an orator, one is born a poet; but it has never been said, one is
born Porthos, and one becomes an engineer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your wit is always
amusing," said Aramis, coldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When you found out our secret, you
made all the haste you could to communicate it to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I certainly made as
much haste as I could, since I saw that you were making still
more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When a man weighing
two hundred and fifty pounds, as Porthos does, rides post; when a
gouty prelate - I beg your pardon, but you yourself told me you
were so - when a prelate scours the highway - I naturally suppose
that my two friends, who did not wish to be communicative with
me, had certain matters of the highest importance to conceal from
me, and so I made as much haste as my leanness and the absence of
gout would allow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did it not occur to
you, my dear friend, that you might be rendering Porthos and
myself a very sad service?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I thought it not
unlikely; but you and Porthos made me play a very ridiculous part
at Belle-Isle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Aramis, "you now know everything?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, indeed."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know I
was obliged to inform M. Fouquet of what had happened, in order
that he would be able to anticipate what you might have to tell
the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is rather
obscure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not at all: M. Fouquet
has his enemies - you will admit that, I suppose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And one in
particular."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A dangerous one?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A mortal
enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, in order to
counteract that man's influence, it was necessary that M. Fouquet
should give the king a proof of his great devotion to him, and of
his readiness to make the greatest sacrifices.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He surprised his majesty by offering
him Belle-Isle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you
had been the first to reach Paris, the surprise would have been
destroyed, it would have looked as if we had yielded to
fear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I understand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is the whole
mystery," said Aramis, satisfied that he had at last quite
convinced the musketeer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Only," said the latter,
"it would have been more simple to have taken me aside, and said
to me, 'My dear D'Artagnan, we are fortifying Belle-Isle, and
intend to offer it to the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tell us frankly, for whom you are
acting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you a friend
of M. Colbert, or of M. Fouquet?'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps I should not have answered
you, but you would have added, - 'Are you my friend?'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should have said 'Yes.'"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis hung down his
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "In this way,"
continued D'Artagnan, "you would have paralyzed my movements, and
I should have gone to the king, and said, 'Sire, M. Fouquet is
fortifying Belle-Isle, and exceedingly well, too; but here is a
note, which the governor of Belle-Isle gave me for your majesty;'
or, 'M. Fouquet is about to wait upon your majesty to explain his
intentions with regard to it.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should not have been placed in an
absurd position; you would have enjoyed the surprise so long
planned, and we should not have had any occasion to look askant
at each other when we met."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "While, on the
contrary," replied Aramis, "you have acted altogether as one
friendly to M. Colbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And you really are a friend of his, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certainly not, indeed!"
exclaimed the captain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"M. Colbert is a mean fellow, and I hate him as I used to hate
Mazarin, but without fearing him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then," said
Aramis, "I love M. Fouquet, and his interests are mine.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know my position.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have no property or means
whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Fouquet gave
me several livings, a bishopric as well; M. Fouquet has served
and obliged me like the generous-hearted man he is, and I know
the world sufficiently well to appreciate a kindness when I meet
with one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Fouquet has
won my regard, and I have devoted myself to his service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You could not possibly
do better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will find
him a very liberal master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis bit his lips; and
then said, "The best a man could possibly have."<span style=

D'Artagnan taking good care not to interrupt him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I suppose you know how
Porthos got mixed up in all this?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," said D'Artagnan;
"I am curious, of course, but I never question a friend when he
wishes to keep a secret from me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, I will tell
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is hardly worth the
trouble, if the confidence is to bind me in any way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! do not be afraid.;
there is no man whom I love better than Porthos, because he is so
simple-minded and good-natured.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos is so straightforward in
everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Since I have
become a bishop, I have looked for these primeval natures, which
make me love truth and hate intrigue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan stroked his
mustache, but said nothing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I saw Porthos and again
cultivated his acquaintance; his own time hanging idly on his
hands, his presence recalled my earlier and better days without
engaging me in any present evil.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I sent for Porthos to come to
Vannes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Fouquet, whose
regard for me is very great, having learnt that Porthos and I
were attached to each other by old ties of friendship, promised
him increase of rank at the earliest promotion, and that is the
whole secret."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I shall not abuse your
confidence," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

dear friend; no one has a finer sense of honor than
yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

you are right, Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

prelate looked searchingly and scrutinizingly at his friend -
"now let us talk of ourselves and for ourselves; will you become
one of M. Fouquet's friends?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not interrupt me until you know
what that means."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will you become a
mar&eacute;chal of France, peer, duke, and the possessor of a
duchy, with a million of francs?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, my friend,"
replied D'Artagnan, "what must one do to get all that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But I already belong to
the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

suppose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

be divided."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

ambitions, as noble hearts like yours have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I wish to be a mar&eacute;chal; the
king will make me mar&eacute;chal, duke, peer; the king will make
me all that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis fixed a searching
look upon D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is not the king
master?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No one disputes it; but
Louis XIII. was master also."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! my dear friend,
between Richelieu and Louis XIII. stood no D'Artagnan," said the
musketeer, very quietly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There are many
stumbling-blocks round the king," said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

feet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "One moment, Aramis; I
observe that every one thinks of himself, and never of his poor
prince; I will maintain myself maintaining him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

ingratitude?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

afraid of that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

of yourself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Still, the king may
some day have no further need for you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On the contrary, I
think his need of me will soon be greater than ever; and hearken,
my dear fellow, if it became necessary to arrest a new
Cond&eacute;, who would do it?<span style=

D'Artagnan struck his sword, which clanked sullenly on the
tesselated floor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right," said
Aramis, turning very pale; and then he rose and pressed
D'Artagnan's hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

summons for supper," said the captain of the musketeers; "will
you excuse me?"</p>

round the musketeer's neck, and said, "A friend like you is the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

I</span>t will not be forgotten how Comte de Guiche left the
queen-mother's apartments on the day when Louis XIV. presented La
Valli&egrave;re with the beautiful bracelets he had won in the
lottery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The comte walked
to and fro for some time outside the palace, in the greatest
distress, from a thousand suspicions and anxieties with which his
mind was beset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Presently
he stopped and waited on the terrace opposite the grove of trees,
watching for Madame's departure.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> More than half an hour passed away;
and as he was at that moment quite alone, the comte could hardly
have had any very diverting ideas at his command.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He drew his tables from his pocket,
and, after hesitating over and over again, determined to write
these words: - "Madame, I implore you to grant me one moment's
conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not be
alarmed at this request, which contains nothing in any way
opposed to the profound respect with which I subscribe myself,
etc., etc."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had signed
and folded this singular love-letter, when he suddenly observed
several ladies leaving the ch&acirc;teau, and afterwards several
courtiers too; in fact, almost every one that formed the queen's
circle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He saw La
Valli&egrave;re herself, then Montalais talking with Malicorne;
he watched the departure of the very last of the numerous guests
that had a short time before thronged the queen-mother's
cabinet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame herself had not
yet passed; she would be obliged, however, to cross the courtyard
in order to enter her own apartments; and, from the terrace where
he was standing, De Guiche could see all that was going on in the
courtyard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At last he saw
Madame leave, attended by a couple of pages, who were carrying
torches before her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She
was walking very quickly; as soon as she reached the door, she
said:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let some one go and
look for De Guiche: he has to render an account of a mission he
had to discharge for me; if he should be disengaged, request him
to be good enough to come to my apartment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Guiche remained
silent, hidden in the shade; but as soon as Madame had withdrawn,
he darted from the terrace down the steps and assumed a most
indifferent air, so that the pages who were hurrying towards his
rooms might meet him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! it is Madame, then,
who is seeking me!" he said to himself, quite overcome; and he
crushed in his hand the now worse than useless letter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. le comte," said one
of the pages, approaching him, "we are indeed most fortunate in
meeting you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so, messieurs?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A command from
Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "From Madame!" said De
Guiche, looking surprised.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, M. le comte, her
royal highness has been asking for you; she expects to hear, she
told us, the result of a commission you had to execute for
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you at
liberty?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am quite at her royal
highness's orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will you have the
goodness to follow us, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> When De Guiche entered
the princess's apartments, he found her pale and agitated.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais was standing at the
door, evidently uneasy about what was passing in her mistress's
mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche
appeared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! is that you,
Monsieur de Guiche?" said Madame; "come in, I beg.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mademoiselle de Montalais, I do not
require your attendance any longer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais, more puzzled
than ever, courtesied and withdrew.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche and the princess were left
alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The come had every
advantage in his favor; it was Madame who had summoned him to a
rendezvous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But how was
it possible for the comte to make use of this advantage?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame was so whimsical, and
her disposition so changeable.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She soon allowed this to be
perceived, for, suddenly, opening the conversation, she said:
"Well! have you nothing to say to me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He imagined she must
have guessed his thoughts; he fancied (for those who are in love
are thus constituted, being as credulous and blind as poets or
prophets), he fancied she knew how ardent was his desire to see
her, and also the subject uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, Madame," he said,
"and I think it very singular."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The affair of the
bracelets," she exclaimed, eagerly, "you mean that, I
suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you think the king
is in love; do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Guiche looked at her for
some time; her eyes sank under his gaze, which seemed to read her
very heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I think," he said,
"that the king may possibly have had an idea of annoying some
one; were it not for that, the king would hardly show himself so
earnest in his attentions as he is; he would not run the risk of
compromising, from mere thoughtlessness of disposition, a young
girl against whom no one has been hitherto able to say a
word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Indeed! the bold,
shameless girl," said the princess, haughtily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I can positively assure
your royal highness," said De Guiche, with a firmness marked by
great respect, "that Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re is
beloved by a man who merits every respect, for he is a brave and
honorable gentleman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Bragelonne?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

your friend, what does that matter to the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king knows that
Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re;
and as Raoul has served the king most valiantly, the king will
not inflict an irreparable injury upon him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame began to laugh in
a manner that produced a sinister impression upon De Guiche.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I repeat, Madame, I do
not believe the king is in love with Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re; and the proof that I do not believe it is, that
I was about to ask you whose <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>amour propre</i> it is likely the
king is desirous of wounding?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You, who are well acquainted with
the whole court, can perhaps assist me in ascertaining that; and
assuredly, with greater certainty, since it is everywhere said
that your royal highness is on very friendly terms with the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame bit her lips,
and, unable to assign any good and sufficient reasons, changed
the conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Prove
to me," she said, fixing on him one of those looks in which the
whole soul seems to pass into the eyes, "prove to me, I say, that
you intended to interrogate me at the very moment I sent for
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Guiche gravely drew
from his pocket the now crumpled note that he had written, and
showed it to her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sympathy," she
said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said the comte,
with an indescribable tenderness of tone, "sympathy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have explained to you how and why
I sought you; you, however, have yet to tell me, Madame, why you
sent for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True," replied the
princess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She hesitated,
and then suddenly exclaimed, "Those bracelets will drive me
mad."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You expected the king
would offer them to you," replied De Guiche.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But before you, Madame,
before you, his sister-in-law, was there not the queen herself to
whom the king should have offered them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Before La
Valli&egrave;re," cried the princess, wounded to the quick,
"could he not have presented them to me?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was there not the whole court,
indeed, to choose from?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I assure you, Madame,"
said the comte, respectfully, "that if any one heard you speak in
this manner, if any one were to see how red your eyes are, and,
Heaven forgive me, to see, too, that tear trembling on your
eyelids, it would be said that your royal highness was
jealous."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Jealous!" said the
princess, haughtily, "jealous of La Valli&egrave;re!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She expected to see De
Guiche yield beneath her scornful gesture and her proud tone; but
he simply and boldly replied, "Jealous of La Valli&egrave;re;
yes, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Am I to suppose,
monsieur," she stammered out, "that your object is to insult
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is not possible,
Madame," replied the comte, slightly agitated, but resolved to
master that fiery nature.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Leave the room!" said
the princess, thoroughly exasperated, De Guiche's coolness and
silent respect having made her completely lose her temper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Guiche fell back a
step, bowed slowly, but with great respect, drew himself up,
looking as white as his lace cuffs, and, in a voice slightly
trembling, said, "It was hardly worth while to have hurried here
to be subjected to this unmerited disgrace."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he turned away with hasty
steps.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He had scarcely gone
half a dozen paces when Madame darted like a tigress after him,
seized him by the cuff, and making him turn round again, said,
trembling with passion as she did so, "The respect you pretend to
have is more insulting than the insult itself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Insult me, if you please, but at
least speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame," said the
comte, gently, as he drew his sword, "thrust this blade into my
heart, rather than kill me by degrees."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At the look he fixed
upon her, - a look full of love, resolution, and despair, even, -
she knew how readily the comte, so outwardly calm in appearance,
would pass his sword through his own breast if she added another
word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She tore the blade
from his hands, and, pressing his arm with a<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> feverish impatience, which might
pass for tenderness, said, "Do not be too hard upon me,
comte.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You see how I am
suffering, and yet you have no pity for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Tears, the cries of this
strange attack, stifled her voice.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as De Guiche saw her weep,
he took her in his arms and carried her to an armchair; in
another moment she would have been suffocated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, why," he murmured,
as he knelt by her side, "why do you conceal your troubles from
me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you love any one -
tell me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It would kill
me, I know, but not until I should have comforted, consoled, and
served you even."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And do you love me to
that extent?" she replied, completely conquered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do indeed love you to
that extent, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She placed both her
hands in his.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My heart
is indeed another's," she murmured in so low a tone that her
voice could hardly be heard; but he heard it, and said, "Is it
the king you love?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She gently shook her
head, and her smile was like a clear bright streak in the clouds,
through which after the tempest has passed one almost fancies
Paradise is opening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"But," she added, "there are other passions in a high-born
heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Love is poetry;
but the real life of the heart is pride.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Comte, I was born on a throne, I am
proud and jealous of my rank.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why does the king gather such
unworthy objects round him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Once more, I repeat,"
said the comte, "you are acting unjustly towards that poor girl,
who will one day be my friend's wife."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you simple enough
to believe that, comte?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If I did not believe
it," he said, turning very pale, "Bragelonne should be informed
of it to-morrow; indeed he should, if I thought that poor La
Valli&egrave;re had forgotten the vows she had exchanged with
Raoul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But no, it would
be cowardly to betray a woman's secret; it would be criminal to
disturb a friend's peace of mind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You think, then," said
the princess, with a wild burst of laughter, "that ignorance is
happiness?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I believe it," he
replied.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Prove it to me, then,"
she said, hurriedly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is easily done,
Madame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is reported
through the whole court that the king loves you, and that you
return his affection."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?" she said,
breathing with difficulty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well; admit for a
moment that Raoul, my friend, had come and said to me, 'Yes, the
king loves Madame, and has made an impression upon her heart,' I
possibly should have slain Raoul."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It would have been
necessary," said the princess, with the obstinacy of a woman who
feels herself not easily overcome, "for M. de Bragelonne to have
had proofs before he ventured to speak to you in that
manner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Such, however, is the
case," replied De Guiche, with a deep sigh, "that, not having
been warned, I have never examined into the matter seriously; and
I now find that my ignorance has saved my life."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So, then, you drive
selfishness and coldness to that extent," said Madame, "that you
would let this unhappy young man continue to love La
Valli&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I would, until La
Valli&egrave;re's guilt were revealed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the bracelets?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, Madame, since you
yourself expected to receive them from the king, what can I
possibly say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The argument was a
telling one, and the princess was overwhelmed by it, and from
that moment her defeat was assured.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But as her heart and mind were
instinct with noble and generous feelings, she understood De
Guiche's extreme delicacy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She saw that in his heart he really
suspected that the king was in love with La Valli&egrave;re, and
that he did not wish to resort to the common expedient of ruining
a rival in the mind of a woman, by giving the latter the
assurance and certainty that this rival's affections were
transferred to another woman.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She guessed that his suspicions of
La Valli&egrave;re were aroused, and that, in order to leave
himself time for his convictions to undergo a change, so as not
to ruin Louise utterly, he was determined to pursue a certain
straightforward line of conduct.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She could read so much real
greatness of character, and such true generosity of disposition
in her lover, that her heart really warmed with affection towards
him, whose passion for her was so pure and delicate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Despite his fear of incurring her
displeasure, De Guiche, by retaining his position as a man of
proud independence of feeling and deep devotion, became almost a
hero in her estimation, and reduced her to the state of a jealous
and little-minded woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
She loved him for this so tenderly, that she could not refuse to
give him a proof of her affection.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "See how many words we
have wasted," she said, taking his hand, "suspicions, anxieties,
mistrust, sufferings - I think we have enumerated all those
words."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame, yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Efface them from your
heart as I drive them from mine.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whether La Valli&egrave;re does or
does not love the king, and whether the king does or does not
love La Valli&egrave;re - from this moment you and I will draw a
distinction in the two characters I have to perform.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You open your eyes so wide that I am
sure you hardly understand me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are so impetuous,
Madame, that I always tremble at the fear of displeasing
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And see how he trembles
now, poor fellow," she said, with the most charming playfulness
of manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes,
monsieur, I have two characters to perform.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am the sister of the king, the
sister-in-law of the king's wife.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this character ought I not to
take an interest in these domestic intrigues?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, tell me what you think?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As little as possible,
Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Agreed, monsieur; but
it is a question of dignity; and then, you know, I am the wife of
the king's brother."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De
Guiche sighed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A
circumstance," she added, with an expression of great tenderness,
"which will remind you that I am always to be treated with the
profoundest respect."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De
Guiche fell at her feet, which he kissed, with the religious
fervor of a worshipper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"And I begin to think that, really and truly, I have another
character to perform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
was almost forgetting it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Name it, oh! name it,"
said De Guiche.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am a woman," she
said, in a voice lower than ever, "and I love."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He rose, she opened her arms, and
their lips met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A
footstep was heard behind the tapestry, and Mademoiselle de
Montalais appeared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you want?" said
Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. de Guiche is
wanted," replied Montalais, who was just in time to see the
agitation of the actors of these four characters; for De Guiche
had consistently carried out his part with heroism.</p>

M</span>ontalais was right.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de Guiche, thus summoned in every
direction, was very much exposed, from such a multiplication of
business, to the risk of not attending to any.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It so happened that, considering the
awkwardness of the interruption, Madame, notwithstanding her
wounded pride, and secret anger, could not, for the moment at
least, reproach Montalais for having violated, in so bold a
manner, the semi-royal order with which she had been dismissed on
De Guiche's entrance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De
Guiche, also, lost his presence of mind, or, it would be more
correct to say, had already lost it, before Montalais's arrival,
for, scarcely had he heard the young girl's voice, than, without
taking leave of Madame, as the most ordinary politeness required,
even between persons equal in rank and station, he fled from her
presence, his heart tumultuously throbbing, and his brain on
fire, leaving the princess with one hand raised, as though to bid
him adieu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais was
at no loss, therefore, to perceive the agitation of the two
lovers - the one who fled was agitated, and the one who remained
was equally so.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," murmured the
young girl, as she glanced inquisitively round her, "this time,
at least, I think I know as much as the most curious woman could
possibly wish to know."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Madame felt so embarrassed by this inquisitorial look, that, as
if she heard Montalais's muttered side remark, she did not speak
a word to her maid of honor, but, casting down her eyes, retired
at once to her bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Montalais, observing this, stood listening for a moment, and then
heard Madame lock and bolt her door.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By this she knew that the rest of
the evening was at her own disposal; and making, behind the door
which had just been closed, a gesture which indicated but little
real respect for the princess, she went down the staircase in
search of Malicorne, who was very busily engaged at that moment
in watching a courier, who, covered with dust, had just left the
Comte de Guiche's apartments.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais knew that Malicorne was
engaged in a matter of some importance; she therefore allowed him
to look and stretch out his neck as much as he pleased; and it
was only when Malicorne had resumed his natural position, that
she touched him on the shoulder.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well," said Montalais, "what is the
latest intelligence you have?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. de Guiche is in love
with Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

know?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

with M. de Guiche."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

consequence of the other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

for me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Malicorne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well, and in
the other direction, what is stirring?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king wished, this
evening, after the lottery, to see Mademoiselle de la

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

locked."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So that - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So that the king was
obliged to go back again, looking very sheepish, like a thief who
has forgotten his crowbar."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And in the third
place?" inquired Montalais.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The courier who has
just arrived for De Guiche came from M. de Bragelonne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Montalais, clapping her hands together.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because we have work to
do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If we get weary now,
something unlucky will be sure to happen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We must divide the
work, then," said Malicorne, "in order to avoid confusion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing easier,"
replied Montalais.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Three
intrigues, carefully nursed, and carefully encouraged, will
produce, one with another, and taking a low average, three love
letters a day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" exclaimed
Malicorne, shrugging his shoulders, "you cannot mean what you
say, darling; three letters a day, that may do for sentimental
common people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A
musketeer on duty, a young girl in a convent, may exchange
letters with their lovers once a day, perhaps, from the top of a
ladder, or through a hole in the wall.<span style=

found M. de Wardes at Calais; he has been seriously wounded in an
affair with the Duke of Buckingham.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes is, as you know,
unquestionably brave, but full of malevolent and wicked
feelings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He conversed
with me about yourself, for whom, he says, he has a warm regard,
also about Madame, whom he considers a beautiful and amiable
woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He has guessed
your affection for a certain person.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He also talked to me about the lady
for whom I have so ardent a regard, and showed the greatest
interest on my behalf in expressing a deep pity for me,
accompanied, however, by dark hints which alarmed me at first,
but which I at last looked upon as the result of his usual love
of mystery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These are the
facts: he had received news of the court; you will understand,
however, that it was only through M. de Lorraine.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The report goes, so says the news,
that a change has taken place in the king's affections.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know whom that
concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Afterwards, the
news continues, people are talking about one of the maids of
honor, respecting whom various slanderous reports are being
circulated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These vague
phrases have not allowed me to sleep.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have been deploring, ever since
yesterday, that my diffidence and vacillation of purpose,
notwithstanding a certain obstinacy of character I may possess,
have left me unable to reply to these insinuations.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In a word, M. de Wardes was setting
off for Paris, and I did not delay his departure with
explanations; for it seemed rather hard, I confess, to
cross-examine a man whose wounds are hardly yet closed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In short, he travelled by
short stages, as he was anxious to leave, he said, in order to be
present at a curious spectacle the court cannot fail to offer
within a short time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
added a few congratulatory words accompanied by vague
sympathizing expressions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I could not understand the one any more than the other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was bewildered by my own
thoughts, and tormented by a mistrust of this man, - a mistrust
which, you know better than any one else, I have never been able
to overcome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as
he left, my perceptions seemed to become clearer.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is hardly possible that a man of
De Wardes's character should not have communicated something of
his own malicious nature to the statements he made to me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is not unlikely, therefore,
that in the strange hints De Wardes threw out in my presence,
there may be a mysterious signification, which I might have some
difficulty in applying either to myself or to some one with whom
you are acquainted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Being
compelled to leave as soon as possible, in obedience to the
king's commands, the idea did not occur to me of running after De
Wardes in order to ask him to explain his reserve; but I have
dispatched a courier to you with this letter, which will explain
in detail my various doubts.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I regard you as myself; you have
reflected and observed; it will be for you to act.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de Wardes will arrive very
shortly; endeavor to learn what he meant, if you do not already
know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de Wardes,
moreover, pretended that the Duke of Buckingham left Paris on the
very best of terms with Madame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was an affair which would have
unhesitatingly made me draw my sword, had I not felt that I was
under the necessity of dispatching the king's mission before
undertaking any quarrel whatsoever.<span style=

folded up the letter a third time, and, instead of burning it, as

De Guiche begged Malicorne to come immediately to his apartments,

acknowledged the invitation with an activity which was the first
result of his conversation with Montalais.<span style=

that his motive was undiscovered, cross-examined Malicorne, the
latter, who appeared to be working in the dark, soon guessed his

consequence was, that, after a quarter of an hour's conversation,
during which De Guiche thought he had ascertained the whole truth
with regard to La Valli&egrave;re and the king, he had learned
absolutely nothing more than his own eyes had already acquainted
him with, while Malicorne learned, or guessed, that Raoul, who
was absent, was fast becoming suspicious, and that De Guiche
intended to watch over the treasure of the Hesperides.<span

the favorable notice Monsieur took of him.<span style=

feared this rival but a little, but who respected a character and

with the addition of a bull-dog courage he did not himself
possess, received De Wardes with a greater display of regard and
affection than even Monsieur had done.<span style=

personal enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two or
three of her ladies accompanied her.<span style=

graceful and respectful manner, and, as a commencement of
hostilities, announced, in the first place, that he could furnish
the Duke of Buckingham's friends with the latest news about
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was a direct
answer to the coldness with which Madame had received him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The attack was a vigorous one,
and Madame felt the blow, but without appearing to have even
noticed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He rapidly
cast a glance at Monsieur and at De Guiche, - the former colored,
and the latter turned very pale.<span style=

countenance; but, as she knew how many unpleasant thoughts and
feelings her enemy could awaken in the two persons who were
listening to him, she smilingly bent forward towards the
traveler, as if to listen to the news he had brought - but he was
speaking of other matters.<span style=

imprudence; if she were to retreat, it would be inviting an

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! you mean he was
more seriously wounded than you were; I was not aware of that,"
said the princess, with utter indifference.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, Madame, you are
mistaken, or rather you pretend to misunderstand my remark.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I did not say that he was a
greater sufferer in body than myself; but his heart was very
seriously affected."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Guiche comprehended
instinctively from what direction the struggle was approaching;
he ventured to make a sign to Madame, as if entreating her to
retire from the contest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But she, without acknowledging De Guiche's gesture, without
pretending to have noticed it even, and still smiling,
continued:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is it possible," she
said, "that the Duke of Buckingham's heart was touched?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had no idea, until now, that
a heart-wound could be cured."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame," replied De Wardes,
politely, "every woman believes that; and it is this belief that
gives them that superiority to man which confidence begets."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You misunderstand
altogether, dearest," said the prince, impatiently; "M. de Wardes
means that the Duke of Buckingham's heart had been touched, not
by the sword, but by something sharper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! very good, very
good!" exclaimed Madame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"It is a jest of M. de Wardes's.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Very good; but I should like to know
if the Duke of Buckingham would appreciate the jest.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is, indeed, a very great pity he
is not here, M. de Wardes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young man's eyes
seemed to flash fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Oh!" he said, as he clenched his teeth, "there is nothing I
should like better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Guiche did not
move.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame seemed to
expect that he would come to her assistance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur hesitated.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Chevalier de Lorraine advanced
and continued the conversation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame," he said, "De
Wardes knows perfectly well that for a Buckingham's heart to be
touched is nothing new, and what he has said has already taken
place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Instead of an ally, I
have two enemies," murmured Madame; "two determined enemies, and
in league with each other."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And she changed the
conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To change
the conversation is, as every one knows, a right possessed by
princes which etiquette requires all to respect.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The remainder of the conversation
was moderate enough in tone; the principal actors had rehearsed
their parts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame
withdrew easily, and Monsieur, who wished to question her on
several matters, offered her his hand on leaving.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The chevalier was seriously afraid
that an understanding might be established between the husband
and wife if he were to leave them quietly together.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He therefore made his way to
Monsieur's apartments, in order to surprise him on his return,
and to destroy with a few words all the good impressions Madame
might have been able to sow in his heart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche advanced towards De
Wardes, who was surrounded by a large number of persons, and
thereby indicated his wish to converse with him; De Wardes, at
the same time, showing by his looks and by a movement of his head
that he perfectly understood him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was nothing in these signs to
enable strangers to suppose they were otherwise than upon the
most friendly footing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De
Guiche could therefore turn away from him, and wait until he was
at liberty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had not
long to wait; for De Wardes, freed from his questioners,
approached De Guiche, and after a fresh salutation, they walked
side by side together.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have made a good
impression since your return, my dear De Wardes," said the
comte.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Excellent, as you
see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And your spirits are
just as lively as ever?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And a very great
happiness, too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why not?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Everything is so ridiculous in this
world, everything so absurd around us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are of my opinion,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should think so!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And what news do you bring us
from yonder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> None at all.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have come to look for news
here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, tell me, you
surely must have seen some people at Boulogne, one of our
friends, for instance; it is no great time ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Some people - one of
our friends - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your memory is
short."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! true; Bragelonne,
you mean."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Exactly so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who was on his way to
fulfil a mission, with which he was intrusted to King Charles
II."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, then, did he not tell you, or
did not you tell him - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not precisely know
what I told him, I must confess: but I do know what I did <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> tell him."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes was <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>finesse</i> itself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He perfectly well knew from De
Guiche's tone and manner, which was cold and dignified, that the
conversation was about to assume a disagreeable turn.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He resolved to let it take what
course it pleased, and to keep strictly on his guard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "May I ask you what you
did not tell him?" inquired De Guiche.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All about La
Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "La
Valli&egrave;re&hellip;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
What is it? and what was that strange circumstance you seem to
have known over yonder, which Bragelonne, who was here on the
spot, was not acquainted with?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you really ask me
that in a serious manner?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing more so."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! you,
a member of the court, living in Madame's household, a friend of
Monsieur's, a guest at their table, the favorite of our lovely
princess?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Guiche colored violently
from anger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What
princess are you alluding to?" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am only acquainted
with one, my dear fellow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I am speaking of Madame herself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you devoted to another princess,
then?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, tell me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Guiche was on the
point of launching out, but he saw the drift of the remark.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A quarrel was imminent between
the two young men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De
Wardes wished the quarrel to be only in Madame's name, while De
Guiche would not accept it except on La Valli&egrave;re's
account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From this
moment, it became a series of feigned attacks, which would have
continued until one of the two had been touched home.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche therefore resumed all the
self-possession he could command.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is not the
slightest question in the world of Madame in this matter, my dear
De Wardes." said Guiche, "but simply of what you were talking
about just now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What was I saying?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That you had concealed
certain things from Bragelonne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certain things which
you know as well as I do," replied De Wardes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, upon my honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nonsense."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If you tell me what
they are, I shall know, but not otherwise, I swear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I who have just arrived from a
distance of sixty leagues, and you who have not stirred from this
place, who have witnessed with your own eyes that which rumor
informed me of at Calais!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Do you now tell me seriously that you do not know what it is
about?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! comte, this is
hardly charitable of you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As you like, De Wardes;
but I again repeat, I know nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are truly discreet
- well! - perhaps it is very prudent of you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And so you will not
tell me anything, will not tell me any more than you told
Bragelonne?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are pretending to
be deaf, I see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am
convinced that Madame could not possibly have more command over
herself than <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>
have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Double hypocrite,"
murmured Guiche to himself, "you are again returning to the old
subject."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well, then,"
continued De Wardes, "since we find it so difficult to understand
each other about La Valli&egrave;re and Bragelonne let us speak
about your own affairs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nay," said De Guiche,
"I have no affairs of my own to talk about.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have not said anything about me,
I suppose, to Bragelonne, which you cannot repeat to my
face?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; but understand me,
Guiche, that however much I may be ignorant of certain matters, I
am quite as conversant with others.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If, for instance, we were conversing
about the intimacies of the Duke of Buckingham at Paris, as I did
during my journey with the duke, I could tell you a great many
interesting circumstances.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Would you like me to mention
them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Guiche passed his
hand across his forehead, which was covered in perspiration.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No, no," he said, "a hundred
times no!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have no
curiosity for matters which do not concern me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Duke of Buckingham is for me
nothing more than a simple acquaintance, whilst Raoul is an
intimate friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have
not the slightest curiosity to learn what happened to the duke,
while I have, on the contrary, the greatest interest in all that
happened to Raoul."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In Paris?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, in
Paris, or Boulogne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
understand I am on the spot; if anything should happen, I am here
to meet it; whilst Raoul is absent, and has only myself to
represent him; so, Raoul's affairs before my own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But he will
return?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not, however, until his
mission is completed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
the meantime, you understand, evil reports cannot be permitted to
circulate about him without my looking into them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And for a better reason
still, that he will remain some time in London," said De Wardes,
chuckling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You think so," said De
Guiche, simply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Think so, indeed! do
you suppose he was sent to London for no other purpose than to go
there and return again immediately?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, no; he was sent to London to
remain there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes," said De Guiche, grasping
De Wardes's hand, "that is a very serious suspicion concerning
Bragelonne, which completely confirms what he wrote to me from
Boulogne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Wardes resumed his
former coldness of manner: his love of raillery had led him too
far, and by his own imprudence, he had laid himself open to
attack.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, tell me, what did
he write to you about?" he inquired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He told me that you had
artfully insinuated some injurious remarks against La
Valli&egrave;re, and that you had seemed to laugh at his great
confidence in that young girl."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, it is perfectly
true I did so," said De Wardes, "and I was quite ready, at the
time, to hear from the Vicomte de Bragelonne that which every man
expects from another whenever anything may have been said to
displease him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the
same way, for instance, if I were seeking a quarrel with you, I
should tell you that Madame after having shown the greatest
preference for the Duke of Buckingham, is at this moment supposed
to have sent the handsome duke away for your benefit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! that would not
wound me in the slightest degree, my dear De Wardes," said De
Guiche, smiling, notwithstanding the shiver that ran through his
whole frame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Why, such a
favor would be too great a happiness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I admit that, but if I
absolutely wished to quarrel with you, I should try and invent a
falsehood, perhaps, and speak to you about a certain arbor, where
you and that illustrious princess were together - I should speak
also of certain gratifications, of certain kissings of the hand;
and you who are so secret on all occasions, so hasty, so
punctilious - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said De Guiche,
interrupting him, with a smile upon his lips, although he almost
felt as if he were going to die; "I swear I should not care for
that, nor should I in any way contradict you; for you must know,
my dear marquis, that for all matters which concern myself I am a
block of ice; but it is a very different thing when an absent
friend is concerned, a friend, who, on leaving, confided his
interests to my safe-keeping; for such a friend, De Wardes,
believe me, I am like fire itself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I understand you,
Monsieur de Guiche.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
spite of what you say, there cannot be any question between us,
just now, either of Bragelonne or of this insignificant girl,
whose name is La Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment some of
the younger courtiers were crossing the apartment, and having
already heard the few words which had just been pronounced, were
able also to hear those which were about to follow.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes observed this, and
continued aloud: - "Oh! if La Valli&egrave;re were a coquette
like Madame, whose innocent flirtations, I am sure, were, first
of all, the cause of the Duke of Buckingham being sent back to
England, and afterwards were the reason of<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> your being sent into exile; for you
will not deny, I suppose, that Madame's pretty ways really had a
certain influence over you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The courtiers drew
nearer to the speakers, Saint-Aignan at their head, and then
Manicamp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, my dear fellow,
whose fault was that?" said De Guiche, laughing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I am a vain, conceited fellow, I
know, and everybody else knows it too.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I took seriously that which was only
intended as a jest, and got myself exiled for my pains.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I saw my error.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I overcame my vanity, and I
obtained my recall, by making the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>amende honorable</i>, and by
promising myself to overcome this defect; and the consequence is,
that I am so thoroughly cured, that I now laugh at the very thing
which, three or four days ago, would have almost broken my
heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Raoul is in
love, and is loved in return; he cannot laugh at the reports
which disturb his happiness - reports which you seem to have
undertaken to interpret, when you know, marquis, as I do, as
these gentlemen do, as every one does in fact, that all such
reports are pure calumny."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Calumny!" exclaimed De
Wardes, furious at seeing himself caught in the snare by De
Guiche's coolness of temper.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certainly -
calumny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look at this
letter from him, in which he tell me you have spoken ill of
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re; and where he asks me, if what
you reported about this young girl is true or not.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you wish me to appeal to these
gentlemen, De Wardes, to decide?"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And with admirable coolness, De
Guiche read aloud the paragraph of the letter which referred to
La Valli&egrave;re.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And
now," continued De Guiche, "there is no doubt in the world, as
far as I am concerned, that you wished to disturb Bragelonne's
peace of mind, and that your remarks were maliciously
intended."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Wardes looked round
him, to see if he could find support from any one; but, at the
idea that De Wardes had insulted, either directly or indirectly,
the idol of the day, every one shook his head; and De Wardes saw
that he was in the wrong.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Messieurs," said De
Guiche, intuitively divining the general feeling, "my discussion
with Monsieur de Wardes refers to a subject so delicate in its
nature, that it is most important no one should hear more than
you have already heard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Close the doors, then, I beg you, and let us finish our
conversation in the manner which becomes two gentlemen, one of
whom has given the other the lie."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Messieurs, messieurs!"
exclaimed those who were present.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

then, that I was wrong in defending Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re?" said De Guiche.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "In that case, I pass judgment upon
myself, and am ready to withdraw the offensive words I may have
used to Monsieur de Wardes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The deuce! certainly
not!" said Saint-Aignan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re is an angel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Virtue and purity

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You see, Monsieur de
Wardes," said De Guiche, "I am not the only one who undertakes
the defense of that poor girl.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I entreat you, therefore, messieurs,
a second time, to leave us.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You see, it is impossible we could
be more calm and composed than we are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was the very thing
the courtiers wished; some went out at one door, and the rest at
the other, and the two young men were left alone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well played," said De
Wardes, to the comte.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How can it be wondered
at, my dear fellow; I have got quite rusty in the country, while
the command you have acquired over yourself, comte, confounds me;
a man always gains something in women's society; so, pray accept
my congratulations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do accept them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

a present of them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Monsieur de Wardes, let us speak as loud as you please."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do not defy
me."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do defy
you, for you are known to be an evil-minded man; if you do that,
you will be looked upon as a coward, too; and Monsieur would have
you hanged, this evening, at his window-casement.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Speak, my dear De Wardes,
speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have fought
already."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But not
quite enough, yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I see, you would not be
sorry to fight with me while my wounds are still open."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; better
still."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The deuce!
you are unfortunate in the moment you have chosen; a duel, after
the one I have just fought, would hardly suit me; I have lost too
much blood at Boulogne; at the slightest effort my wounds would
open again, and you would really have too good a bargain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True," said De Guiche;
"and yet, on your arrival here, your looks and your arms showed
there was nothing the matter with you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my arms are all
right, but my legs are weak; and then, I have not had a foil in
my hand since that devil of a duel; and you, I am sure, have been
fencing every day, in order to carry your little conspiracy
against me to a successful issue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Upon my honor,
monsieur," replied De Guiche, "it is six months since I last
practiced."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

reflection, I will not fight, at least, with you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will await Bragelonne's return,
since you say it is Bragelonne who finds fault with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh no, indeed!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You shall not wait until
Bragelonne's return," exclaimed the comte, losing all command
over himself, "for you have said that Bragelonne might, possibly,
be some time before he returns; and, in the meanwhile, your
wicked insinuations would have had their effect."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yet, I shall have my
excuse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So take
care."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to finish your recovery."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is better.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We will wait a week."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes, I understand;
a week will give time to my adversary to make his escape.<span

one day, even."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are mad, monsieur,"
said De Wardes, retreating a step.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you are a coward,
if you do not fight willingly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nay, what is more, I will denounce
you to the king, as having refused to fight, after having
insulted La Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said De Wardes,
"you are dangerously treacherous, though you pass for a man of
honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is nothing more
dangerous than the treachery, as you term it, of the man whose
conduct is always loyal and upright."</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Restore me the use of
my legs, then, or get yourself bled, till you are as white as I
am, so as to equalize our chances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no; I have
something better than that to propose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We will fight on
horseback, and will exchange three pistol-shots each.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are a first rate marksman.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have seen you bring down
swallows with single balls, and at full gallop.<span style=

myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I believe you are
right," said De Wardes; "and as that is the case, it is not
unlikely I might kill you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

me a very great service, if you did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is it agreed?<span

it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

condition, however."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Name it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

be said about it to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not a word, I
swear."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will go

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And both of them, on
their way to the stables, passed beneath Madame's windows, which
were faintly lighted; a shadow could be seen behind the lace
curtains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "There is a

are going to fight - to die, perhaps, on her account."</p>

D</span>e Wardes and De Guiche selected their horses, and saddled
them with their own hands, with holster saddles.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche, having two pairs of
pistols, went to his apartments to get them; and after having
loaded them, gave the choice to De Wardes, who selected the pair
he had made use of twenty times before - the same, indeed, with
which De Guiche had seen him kill swallows flying.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You will not be surprised," he
said, "if I take every precaution.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know the weapons well, and,
consequently, I am only making the chances equal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your remark was quite
useless," replied De Guiche, "and you have done no more than you
are entitled to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Now," said De Wardes,
"I beg you to have the goodness to help me to mount; for I still
experience a little difficulty in doing so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, we had
better settle the matter on foot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; once in the saddle,
I shall be all right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good, then; we
will not speak of it again," said De Guiche, as he assisted De
Wardes to mount his horse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And now," continued the
young man, "in our eagerness to murder one another, we have
neglected one circumstance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That it is quite dark,
and we shall almost be obliged to grope about, in order to
kill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said De Guiche,
"you are as anxious as I am that everything should be done in
proper order."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but I do not wish
people to say that you have assassinated me, any more than,
supposing I were to kill you, I should myself like to be accused
of such a crime."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did any one make a
similar remark about your duel with the Duke of Buckingham?" said
De Guiche; "it took place precisely under the same conditions as
ours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very true; but there
was still light enough to see by; and we were up to our middles
almost, in the water; besides, there were a good number of
spectators on shore, looking at us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> De Guiche reflected for
a moment; and the thought which had already presented itself to
him became more confirmed - that De Wardes wished to have
witnesses present, in order to bring back the conversation about
Madame, and to give a new turn to the combat.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He avoided saying a word in reply,
therefore; and, as De Wardes once more looked at him
interrogatively, he replied, by a movement of the head, that it
would be best to let things remain as they were.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two adversaries consequently set
off, and left the ch&acirc;teau by the same gate, close to which
we may remember to have seen Montalais and Malicorne
together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The night, as
if to counteract the extreme heat of the day, had gathered the
clouds together in masses which were moving slowly along from the
west to the east.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
vault above, without a clear spot anywhere visible, or without
the faintest indication of thunder, seemed to hang heavily over
the earth, and soon began, by the force of the wind, to split
into streamers, like a huge sheet torn to shreds.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Large and warm drops of rain began
to fall heavily, and gathered the dust into globules, which
rolled along the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
At the same time, the hedges, which seemed conscious of the
approaching storm, the thirsty plants, the drooping branches of
the trees, exhaled a thousand aromatic odors, which revived in
the mind tender recollections, thoughts of youth, endless life,
happiness, and love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "How
fresh the earth smells," said De Wardes; "it is a piece of
coquetry to draw us to her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "By the by," replied De
Guiche, "several ideas have just occurred to me; and I wish to
have your opinion upon them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Relative to - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Relative to our
engagement."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"It is quite some
time, in fact, that we should begin to arrange matters."<br>
"Is it to be an ordinary combat, and conducted according to
established custom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let me first know
what your established custom is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That we dismount
in any particular open space that may suit us, fasten our horses
to the nearest object, meet, each without our pistols in our
hands, and afterwards retire for a hundred and fifty paces, in
order to advance on each other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good; that is
precisely the way in which I killed poor Follivent, three weeks
ago, at Saint-Denis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I beg your pardon,
but you forgot one circumstance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is that?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That in
your duel with Follivent you advanced towards each other on foot,
your swords between your teeth, and your pistols in your
hands."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"True."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"While now, on the
contrary, as you cannot walk, you yourself admit that we shall
have to mount our horses again, and charge; and the first who
wishes to fire will do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is the best
course, no doubt; but it is quite dark; we must make allowances
for more missed shots than would be the case in the daytime."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well; each
will fire three times; the pair of pistols already loaded, and
one reload."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Excellent!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where shall our engagement
take place?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you any
preference?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You see that small
wood which lies before us?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The wood which is
called Rochin?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You know it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Perfectly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You know that
there is an open glade in the center?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, this glade
is admirably adapted for such a purpose, with a variety of roads,
by-places, paths, ditches, windings, and avenues.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We could not find a better
spot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am perfectly
satisfied, if you are so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
We are at our destination, if I am not mistaken."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look at the beautiful open space in
the center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The faint
light which the stars afford seems concentrated in this spot; the
woods which surround it seem, with their barriers, to form its
natural limits."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do as you say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let us first
settle the conditions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"These are mine; if
you have any objection to make you will state it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am
listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If the horse be
killed, its rider will be obliged to fight on foot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is a matter
of course, since we have no change of horses here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But that does not
oblige his adversary to dismount."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"His adversary
will, in fact, be free to act as he likes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The adversaries,
having once met in close contact, cannot quit each other under
any circumstances, and may, consequently, fire muzzle to
muzzle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Agreed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Three shots and no
more will do, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quite sufficient,
I think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here are powder
and balls for your pistols; measure out three charges, take three
balls, I will do the same; then we will throw the rest of the
powder and balls away."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And we will
solemnly swear," said De Wardes, "that we have neither balls nor
powder about us?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Agreed; and I
swear it," said De Guiche, holding his hand towards heaven, a
gesture which De Wardes imitated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And now, my dear
comte," said De Wardes, "allow me to tell you that I am in no way
your dupe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You already
are, or soon will be, the accepted lover of Madame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have detected your secret, and you
are afraid I shall tell others of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You wish to kill me, to insure my
silence; that is very clear; and in your place, I should do the
same."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche hung
down his head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Only,"
continued De Wardes, triumphantly, "was it really worth while,
tell me, to throw this affair of Bragelonne's on my
shoulders?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, take
care, my dear fellow; in bringing the wild boar to bay, you
enrage him to madness; in running down the fox, you endow him
with the ferocity of the jaguar.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The consequence is, that brought to
bay by you, I shall defend myself to the very last."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will be quite
right to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; but take
care; I shall work more harm than you think.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the first place, as a beginning,
you will readily suppose that I have not been absurd enough to
lock up my secret, or your secret rather, in my own breast.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is a friend of mine, who
resembles me in every way, a man whom you know very well, who
shares my secret with me; so, pray understand, that if you kill
me, my death will not have been of much service to you; whilst,
on the contrary, if I kill you - and everything is possible, you
know - you understand?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
De Guiche shuddered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "If
I kill you," continued De Wardes, "you will have secured two
mortal enemies to Madame, who will do their very utmost to ruin
her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! monsieur,"
exclaimed De Guiche, furiously, "do not reckon upon my death so
easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of the two
enemies you speak of, I trust most heartily to dispose of one
immediately, and the other at the earliest opportunity."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The only reply De
Wardes made was a burst of laughter, so diabolical in its sound,
that a superstitious man would have been terrified.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But De Guiche was not so
impressionable as that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"I think," he said, "that everything is now settled, Monsieur de
Wardes; so have the goodness to take your place first, unless you
would prefer me to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"By no means," said
De Wardes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I shall be
delighted to save you the slightest trouble."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And spurring his horse to a gallop,
he crossed the wide open space, and took his stand at that point
of the circumference of the cross-road immediately opposite to
where De Guiche was stationed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche remained motionless.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this distance of a hundred
paces, the two adversaries were absolutely invisible to each
other, being completely concealed by the thick shade of elms and
chestnuts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A minute
elapsed amidst the profoundest silence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the end of the minute, each of
them, in the deep shade in which he was concealed, heard the
double click of the trigger, as they put the pistols on full
cock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche, adopting
the usual tactics, put his horse to a gallop, persuaded that he
should render his safety doubly sure by the movement, as well as
by the speed of the animal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He directed his course in a straight
line towards the point where, in his opinion, De Wardes would be
stationed; and he expected to meet De Wardes about half-way; but
in this he was mistaken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He continued his course, presuming that his adversary was
impatiently awaiting his approach.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When, however, he had gone about
two-thirds of the distance, he beheld the trees suddenly
illuminated and a ball flew by, cutting the plume of his hat in
two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nearly at the same
moment, and as if the flash of the first shot had served to
indicate the direction of the other, a second report was heard,
and a second ball passed through the head of De Guiche's horse, a
little below the ear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
animal fell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These two
reports, proceeding from the very opposite direction in which he
expected to find De Wardes, surprised him a great deal; but as he
was a man of amazing self-possession, he prepared himself for his
horse falling, but not so completely, however, that the toe of
his boot escaped being caught under the animal as it fell.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Very fortunately the horse in
its dying agonies moved so as to enable him to release the leg
which was less entangled than the other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche rose, felt himself all
over, and found that he was not wounded.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the very moment he had felt the
horse tottering under him, he placed his pistols in the holsters,
afraid that the force of the fall might explode one at least, if
not both of them, by which he would have been disarmed, and left
utterly without defense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Once on his feet, he took the pistols out of the holsters, and
advanced towards the spot where, by the light of the flash, he
had seen De Wardes appear.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes had, at the first shot,
accounted for the maneuver, than which nothing could have been
simpler.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Instead of
advancing to meet De Guiche, or remaining in his place to await
his approach, De Wardes had, for about fifteen paces, followed
the circle of the shadow which hid him from his adversary's
observation, and at the very moment when the latter presented his
flank in his career, he had fired from the place where he stood,
carefully taking aim, and assisted instead of being
inconvenienced by the horse's gallop.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It has been seen that,
notwithstanding the darkness, the first ball passed hardly more
than an inch above De Guiche's head.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes had so confidently relied
upon his aim, that he thought he had seen De Guiche fall; his
astonishment was extreme when he saw he still remained erect in
his saddle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He hastened
to fire his second shot, but his hand trembled, and he killed the
horse instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It would
be a most fortunate chance for him if De Guiche were to remain
held fast under the animal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Before he could have freed himself,
De Wardes would have loaded his pistol and had De Guiche at his
mercy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But De Guiche, on
the contrary, was up, and had three shots to fire.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche immediately understood the
position of affairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
would be necessary to exceed De Wardes in rapidity of
execution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He advanced,
therefore, so as to reach him before he should have had time to
reload his pistol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De
Wardes saw him approaching like a tempest.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The ball was rather tight, and
offered some resistance to the ramrod.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To load carelessly would be simply
to lose his last chance; to take the proper care in loading meant
fatal loss of time, or rather, throwing away his life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He made his horse bound on one
side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche turned
round also, and, at the moment the horse was quiet again, fired,
and the ball carried off De Wardes's hat from his head.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes now knew that he had
a moment's time at his own disposal; he availed himself of it in
order to finish loading his pistol.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche, noticing that his
adversary did not fall, threw the pistol he had just discharged
aside, and walked straight towards De Wardes, elevating the
second pistol as he did so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had hardly proceeded more than
two or three paces, when De Wardes took aim at him as he was
walking, and fired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An
exclamation of anger was De Guiche's answer; the comte's arm
contracted and dropped motionless by his side, and the pistol
fell from his grasp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His
anxiety was excessive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I
am lost," murmured De Wardes, "he is not mortally wounded."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the very moment, however,
De Guiche was about to raise his pistol against De Wardes, the
head, shoulders, and limbs of the comte seemed to collapse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He heaved a deep-drawn sigh,
tottered, and fell at the feet of De Wardes's horse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is all
right," said De Wardes, and gathering up the reins, he struck his
spurs into the horse's sides.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The horse cleared the comte's
motionless body, and bore De Wardes rapidly back to the
ch&acirc;teau.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When he
arrived there, he remained a quarter of an hour deliberating
within himself as to the proper course to be adopted.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In his impatience to leave the field
of battle, he had omitted to ascertain whether De Guiche were
dead or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A double
hypothesis presented itself to De Wardes's agitated mind; either
De Guiche was killed, or De Guiche was wounded only.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he were killed, why should he
leave his body in that manner to the tender mercies of the
wolves; it was a perfectly useless piece of cruelty, for if De
Guiche were dead, he certainly could not breathe a syllable of
what had passed; if he were not killed, why should he, De Wardes,
in leaving him there uncared for, allow himself to be regarded as
a savage, incapable of one generous feeling?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This last consideration determined
his line of conduct.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>De Wardes
immediately instituted inquires after Manicamp.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was told that Manicamp had been
looking after De Guiche, and, not knowing where to find him, had
retired to bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes
went and awoke the sleeper, without any delay, and related the
whole affair to him, which Manicamp listened to in perfect
silence, but with an expression of momentarily increasing energy,
of which his face could hardly have been supposed capable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was only when De Wardes had
finished, that Manicamp uttered the words, "Let us go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>As they proceeded,
Manicamp became more and more excited, and in proportion as De
Wardes related the details of the affair to him, his countenance
assumed every moment a darker expression.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And so," he said, when De Wardes
had finished, "you think he is dead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Alas, I do."<br>
"And you fought in that manner, without witnesses?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"He insisted upon
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"It is very
singular."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"What do you mean
by saying it is singular?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"That it is very
unlike Monsieur de Guiche's disposition."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"You do not doubt
my word, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Hum! hum!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"You do doubt it,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"A little.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I shall doubt it more than
ever, I warn you, if I find the poor fellow is really dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Monsieur
Manicamp!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Monsieur de
Wardes!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"It seems you
intend to insult me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Just as you
please.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fact is, I
never did like people who come and say, 'I have killed such and
such a gentleman in a corner; it is a great pity, but I killed
him in a perfectly honorable manner.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It has an ugly appearance, M. de
Wardes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Silence! we have
arrived."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>In fact, the glade
could now be seen, and in the open space lay the motionless body
of the dead horse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To the
right of the horse, upon the dark grass, with his face against
the ground, the poor comte lay, bathed in his blood.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had remained in the same spot,
and did not even seem to have made the slightest movement.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Manicamp threw himself on his
knees, lifted the comte in his arms, and found him quite cold,
and steeped in blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
let him gently fall again.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, stretching out his hand and
feeling all over the ground close to where the comte lay, he
sought until he found De Guiche's pistol.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"By Heaven!" he
said, rising to his feet, pale as death and with the pistol in
his hand, "you are not mistaken, he is quite dead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Dead!" repeated De
Wardes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; and his
pistol is still loaded," added Manicamp, looking into the
pan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But I told you
that I took aim as he was walking towards me, and fired at him at
the very moment he was going to fire at me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Are you quite sure
that you fought with him, Monsieur de Wardes?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I confess that I am very much afraid
it has been a foul assassination.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nay, nay, no exclamations!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have had your three shots,
and his pistol is still loaded.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have killed his horse, and he,
De Guiche, one of the best marksmen in France, has not touched
even either your horse or yourself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, Monsieur de Wardes, you have
been very unlucky in bringing me here; all the blood in my body
seems to have mounted to my head; and I verily believe that since
so good an opportunity presents itself, I shall blow your brains
out on the spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So,
Monsieur de Wardes, recommend yourself to Heaven."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur Manicamp,
you cannot think of such a thing!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"On the contrary, I
am thinking of it very strongly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Would you
assassinate me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Without the
slightest remorse, at least for the present."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Are you a
gentleman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have given a
great many proofs of that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let me defend my
life, then, at least."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very likely; in
order, I suppose, that you may do to me what you have done to
poor De Guiche."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And Manicamp slowly
raised his pistol to the height of De Wardes's breast, and with
arm stretched out, and a fixed, determined look on his face, took
a careful aim.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>De Wardes did not
attempt a flight; he was completely terrified.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the midst, however, of this
horrible silence, which lasted about a second, but which seemed
an age to De Wardes, a faint sigh was heard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh," exclaimed De
Wardes, "he still lives!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Help, De Guiche, I am about to be assassinated!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Manicamp fell back
a step or two, and the two young men saw the comte raise himself
slowly and painfully upon one hand.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Manicamp threw the pistol away a
dozen paces, and ran to his friend, uttering a cry of
delight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Wardes wiped
his forehead, which was covered with a cold perspiration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It was just in
time," he murmured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where are you
hurt?" inquired Manicamp of De Guiche, "and whereabouts are you
wounded?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>De Guiche showed
him his mutilated hand and his chest covered with blood.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Comte," exclaimed
De Wardes, "I am accused of having assassinated you; speak, I
implore you, and say that I fought loyally."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Perfectly so,"
said the wounded man; "Monsieur de Wardes fought quite loyally,
and whoever says the contrary will make an enemy of me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Then, sir," said
Manicamp, "assist me, in the first place, to carry this gentleman
home, and I will afterwards give you every satisfaction you
please; or, if you are in a hurry, we can do better still; let us
stanch the blood from the comte's wounds here, with your
pocket-handkerchief and mine, and then, as there are two shots
left, we can have them between us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Thank you," said
De Wardes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Twice
already, in one hour, I have seen death too close at hand to be
agreeable; I don't like his look at all, and I prefer your
apologies."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Manicamp burst out
laughing, and Guiche, too, in spite of his sufferings.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two young men wished to
carry him, but he declared he felt quite strong enough to walk
alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The ball had
broken his ring-finger and his little finger, and then had
glanced along his side, but without penetrating deeply into his
chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was the pain
rather than the seriousness of the wound, therefore, which had
overcome De Guiche.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Manicamp passed his arm under one of the count's shoulders, and
De Wardes did the same with the other, and in this way they
brought him back to Fontainebleau, to the house of the same
doctor who had been present at the death of the Franciscan,
Aramis's predecessor.</p>

T</span>he king, while these matters were being arranged, was
sitting at the supper-table, and the not very large number of
guests for that day had taken their seats too, after the usual
gesture intimating the royal permission.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this period of Louis XIV.'s
reign, although etiquette was not governed by the strict
regulations subsequently adopted, the French court had entirely
thrown aside the traditions of good-fellowship and patriarchal
affability existing in the time of Henry IV., which the
suspicious mind of Louis XIII. had gradually replaced with
pompous state and ceremony, which he despaired of being able
fully to realize.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king, therefore, was
seated alone at a small separate table, which, like the desk of a
president, overlooked the adjoining tables.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although we say a small table, we
must not omit to add that this small table was the largest one
there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Moreover, it was
the one on which were placed the greatest number and quantity of
dishes, consisting of fish, game, meat, fruit, vegetables, and
preserves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king was
young and full of vigor and energy, very fond of hunting,
addicted to all violent exercises of the body, possessing,
besides, like all the members of the Bourbon family, a rapid
digestion and an appetite speedily renewed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis XIV. was a formidable
table-companion; he delighted in criticising his cooks; but when
he honored them by praise and commendation, the honor was
overwhelming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king
began by eating several kinds of soup, either mixed together or
taken separately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
intermixed, or rather separated, each of the soups by a glass of
old wine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He ate quickly
and somewhat greedily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Porthos, who from the beginning had, out of respect, been waiting
for a jog of D'Artagnan's arm, seeing the king make such rapid
progress, turned to the musketeer and said in a low voice:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It seems as if one
might go on now; his majesty is very encouraging, from the
example he sets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Look."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king eats," said
D'Artagnan, "but he talks at the same time; try and manage
matters in such a manner that, if he should happen to address a
remark to you, he will not find you with your mouth full - which
would be very disrespectful."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The best way, in that
case," said Porthos, "is to eat no supper at all; and yet I am
very hungry, I admit, and everything looks and smells most
invitingly, as if appealing to all my senses at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Don't think of not
eating for a moment," said D'Artagnan; "that would put his
majesty out terribly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king has a saying, 'that he who works well, eats well,' and he
does not like people to eat indifferently at his table."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How can I avoid having
my mouth full if I eat?" said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All you have to do,"
replied the captain of the musketeers, "is simply to swallow what
you have in it, whenever the king does you the honor to address a
remark to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good," said
Porthos; and from that moment he began to eat with a certain
well-bred enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king occasionally
looked at the different persons who were at table with him, and,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>en connoisseur</i>, could
appreciate the different dispositions of his guests.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

manner, made him start, and by a vigorous effort of his gullet he
absorbed the whole mouthful.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," replied Porthos,
in a stifled voice, but sufficiently intelligible,
nevertheless.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let those <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I like
everything," replied Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"Everything your majesty sends me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

apparently received with great satisfaction.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Porthos did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos
received the dish of lamb, and put a portion of it on his
plate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Porthos, calmly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I believe that
from my own province, as everywhere else, the best of everything

I do not eat lamb in the same way your majesty does."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sausages he procures from Strasburg, force-meat balls from
Troyes, and larks from Pithiviers; by some means or other, which
I am not acquainted with, he bones the lamb as he would do a
fowl, leaving the skin on, however, which forms a brown crust all
over the animal; when it is cut in beautiful slices, in the same
way as an enormous sausage, a rose-colored gravy pours forth,
which is as agreeable to the eye as it is exquisite to the
palate."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Porthos
finished by smacking his lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Absolutely an entire
lamb, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pass those pheasants to
M. du Vallon; I perceive he is an amateur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The order was
immediately obeyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then,
continuing the conversation, he said: "And you do not find the
lamb too fat?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire, the fat falls
down at the same time as the gravy does, and swims on the
surface; then the servant who carves removes the fat with a
spoon, which I have had expressly made for that purpose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where do you reside?"
inquired the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At Pierrefonds,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At Pierrefonds; where
is that, M. du Vallon - near Belle-Isle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no, sire!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Pierrefonds is in the
Soissonnais."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I thought you alluded
to the lamb on account of the salt marshes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire, I have
marshes which are not salt, it is true, but which are not the
less valuable on that account."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king had now arrived
at the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entrements</i>, but
without losing sight of Porthos, who continued to play his part
in the best manner.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have an excellent
appetite, M. du Vallon," said the king, "and you make an
admirable guest at table."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! sire, if your
majesty were ever to pay a visit to Pierrefonds, we would both of
us eat our lamb together; for your appetite is not an indifferent
one by any means."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan gave Porthos
a kick under the table, which made Porthos color up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At your majesty's
present happy age," said Porthos, in order to repair the mistake
he had made, "I was in the musketeers, and nothing could ever
satisfy me then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your
majesty has an excellent appetite, as I have already had the
honor of mentioning, but you select what you eat with quite too
much refinement to be called for one moment a great eater."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king seemed charmed
at his guest's politeness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will you try some of
these creams?" he said to Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, you majesty
treats me with far too much kindness to prevent me speaking the
whole truth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pray do so, M. du
Vallon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will, sire, with regard
to sweet dishes I only recognize pastry, and even that should be
rather solid; all these frothy substances swell the stomach, and
occupy a space which seems to me to be too precious to be so
badly tenanted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! gentlemen," said
the king, indicating Porthos by a gesture, "here is indeed a
model of gastronomy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
was in such a manner that our fathers, who so well knew what good
living was, used to <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>eat</i>, while we," added his
majesty, "do nothing but tantalize with our stomachs."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And as he spoke, he took the
breast of a chicken with ham, while Porthos attacked a dish of
partridges and quails.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The cup-bearer filled his majesty's glass.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Give M. du Vallon some of my wine,"
said the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was
one of the greatest honors of the royal table.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan pressed his friend's
knee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "If<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> you could only manage to swallow the
half of that boar's head I see yonder," said he to Porthos, "I
shall believe you will be a duke and peer within the next
twelvemonth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Presently," said
Porthos, phlegmatically; "I shall come to that by and by."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In fact it was not long
before it came to the boar's turn, for the king seemed to take
pleasure in urging on his guest; he did not pass any of the
dishes to Porthos until he had tasted them himself, and he
accordingly took some of the boar's head.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos showed that he could keep
pace with his sovereign; and, instead of eating the half, as
D'Artagnan had told him, he ate three-fourths of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It is impossible," said the king in
an undertone, "that a gentleman who eats so good a supper every
day, and who has such beautiful teeth, can be otherwise than the
most straightforward, upright man in my kingdom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you hear?" said
D'Artagnan in his friend's ear.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; I think I am
rather in favor," said Porthos, balancing himself on his
chair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! you are in luck's
way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king and Porthos
continued to eat in the same manner, to the great satisfaction of
the other guests, some of whom, from emulation, had attempted to
follow them, but were obliged to give up half-way.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king soon began to get flushed
and the reaction of the blood to his face announced that the
moment of repletion had arrived.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was then that Louis XIV., instead
of becoming gay and cheerful, as most good livers generally do,
became dull, melancholy, and taciturn.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos, on the contrary, was lively
and communicative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan's foot had more than once to remind him of this
peculiarity of the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The dessert now made its appearance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king had ceased to think
anything further of Porthos; he turned his eyes anxiously towards
the entrance-door, and he was heard occasionally to inquire how
it happened that Monsieur de Saint-Aignan was so long in
arriving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At last, at the
moment when his majesty was finishing a pot of preserved plums
with a deep sigh, Saint-Aignan appeared.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king's eyes, which had become
somewhat dull, immediately began to sparkle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The comte advanced towards the
king's table, and Louis rose at his approach.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Everybody got up at the same time,
including Porthos, who was just finishing an almond-cake capable
of making the jaws of a crocodile stick together.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire, your majesty

king in ecstasy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Give
them to me at once."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
Louis broke the seal of a little letter, inclosing the verses
which history has preserved entire for us, and which are more
meritorious in invention than in execution.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such as they were, however, the king
was enchanted with them, and exhibited his satisfaction by
unequivocal transports of delight; but the universal silence
which reigned in the rooms warned Louis, so sensitively
particular with regard to good breeding, that his delight must
give rise to various interpretations.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He turned aside and put the note in
his pocket, and then advancing a few steps, which brought him
again to the threshold of the door close to his guests, he said,
"M. du Vallon, I have seen you to-day with the greatest pleasure,
and my pleasure will be equally great to see you again."<span

of Rhodes would have done, and retired from the room with his

Gentlemen," addressing himself to the other guests, "I return to
Paris to-morrow on account of the departure of the Spanish and

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The apartment was

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire, he has

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! no!" returned
Saint-Aignan, "you are mistaken sire; every one is not precisely

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How do you know
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Does your majesty

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"When?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"This very evening,
before your majesty's supper was served."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That can hardly
be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have issued such
stringent and severe ordinances with respect to duelling, that no
one, I presume, would dare to disobey them."</p>

Heaven preserve me from excusing any one!" exclaimed
Saint-Aignan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Your

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"This evening?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"One of his hands
shattered, and a hole in his breast.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are concealing
something from me, Saint-Aignan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nothing, sire, I
assure you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Then, explain to
me how the accident happened; was it a musket that burst?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very likely,
sire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But yet, on
reflection, it could hardly have been that, for De Guiche's
pistol was found close by him still loaded."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"His pistol?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But a man does not go to a
boar-hunt with a pistol, I should think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire, it is also
said that De Guiche's horse was killed and that the horse is
still to be found in the wide open glade in the forest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"His horse? -
Guiche go on horseback to a boar-hunt? - Saint-Aignan, I do not
understand a syllable of what you have been telling me.<span

happen?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At the Rond-point,

little door of the private staircase."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will mount

twice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What!" exclaimed
the king, amazed at the reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Under the edicts,
sire, of Cardinal Richelieu," returned D'Artagnan, with his usual
impassability.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is very
different, monsieur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
will, therefore, go there, and will examine the locality very

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I prohibit your
speaking with any one, whoever it may be."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Except with the
person who must give me a lantern," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! that is a
matter of course," said the king, laughing at the liberty, which
he tolerated in no one but his captain of the musketeers.<span

staircase.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Now, let my

account of the state of the person you may see in the house you
will be taken to."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The

to obey Louis XIV., and left the room preceding Saint-Aignan.</p>

inspection, he returned silently to where he had left his horse,
and pursued his way in deep reflection and at a foot-pace to
Fontainebleau.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis was
waiting in his cabinet; he was alone, and with a pencil was
scribbling on paper certain lines which D'Artagnan at the first

the butt end of the pistol was covered with blood, and the trace

seriously wounded?"<br>

make his reverence to the king, who returned the salutation by a

sire."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But you

place?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the hunt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The very spot,
sire."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good; give
me all the details you are acquainted with, respecting this
unhappy affair, Monsieur de Manicamp."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp looked round
him; he saw only D'Artagnan leaning with his back against the
wainscot - D'Artagnan, calm, kind, and good-natured as usual -
and Saint-Aignan whom he had accompanied, and who still leaned
over the king's armchair with an expression of countenance
equally full of good feeling.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He determined, therefore, to speak
out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Your majesty is
perfectly aware," he said, "that accidents are very frequent in
hunting."</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In hunting, do you
say?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean,
sire, when an animal is brought to bay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, ah!" said the king,
"it was when the animal was brought to bay, then, that the
accident happened?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas! sire, unhappily
it was."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king paused for a
moment before he said: "What animal was being hunted?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A wild
boar, sire."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what
could possibly have possessed De Guiche to go to a wild boar-hunt
by himself; that is but a clownish idea of sport, only fit for
that class of people who, unlike the Mar&eacute;chal de Gramont,
have no dogs and huntsmen, to hunt as gentlemen should do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp shrugged his
shoulders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Youth is very
rash," he said, sententiously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, go on," said the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At all events,"
continued Manicamp, not venturing to be too precipitate and
hasty, and letting his words fall very slowly one by one, "at all
events, sire, poor De Guiche went hunting - all alone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Quite alone? indeed? -
What a sportsman!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And is
not M. de Guiche aware that the wild boar always stands at
bay?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that really happened, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

of the beast being there?"</p>

peasants had seen it among their potatoes."</p>

was it?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A short,
thick beast."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You may as
well tell me, monsieur, that De Guiche had some idea of
committing suicide; for I have seen him hunt, and he is an active
and vigorous hunter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Whenever he fires at an animal brought to bay and held in check
by the dogs, he takes every possible precaution, and yet he fires
with a carbine, and on this occasion he seems to have faced the
boar with pistols only."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp started.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A costly pair of
pistols, excellent weapons to fight a duel with a man and not a
wild boar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What an
absurdity!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There are some things,
sire, which are difficult of explanation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are quite right,
and the event which we are now discussing is certainly one of
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Go on."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> During the recital,
Saint-Aignan, who probably would have made a sign to Manicamp to
be careful what he was about, found that the king's glance was
constantly fixed upon himself, so that it was utterly impossible
to communicate with Manicamp in any way.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for D'Artagnan, the statue of
Silence at Athens was far more noisy and far more expressive than
he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Manicamp, therefore,
was obliged to continue in the same way he had begun, and so
contrived to get more and more entangled in his explanation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire," he said, "this is
probably how the affair happened.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Guiche was waiting to receive the
boar as it rushed towards him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On foot or on
horseback?" inquired the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On horseback.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He fired upon the brute and
missed his aim, and then it dashed upon him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the horse was
killed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! your majesty knows
that, then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have been told that a
horse has been found lying dead in the cross-roads of the
Bois-Rochin, and I presume it was De Guiche's horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Perfectly true, sire,
it was his."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, so
much for the horse, and now for De Guiche?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "De Guiche,
once down, was attacked and worried by the wild boar, and wounded
in the hand and in the chest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is a horrible
accident, but it must be admitted it was De Guiche's own
fault.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How could he
possibly have gone to hunt such an animal merely armed with
pistols; he must have forgotten the fable of Adonis?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp rubbed his ear
in seeming perplexity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Very true," he said, "it was very imprudent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Can you explain it,
Monsieur Manicamp?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, what
is written is written!"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! you are
a fatalist."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp looked very
uncomfortable and ill at ease.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am angry with you,
Monsieur Manicamp," continued the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "With me, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How was it that you, who are De
Guiche's intimate friend, and who know that he is subject to such
acts of folly, did not stop him in time?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp no
longer knew what to do; the tone in which the king spoke was
anything but that of a credulous man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the other hand, it did not
indicate any particular severity, nor did he seem to care very
much about the cross-examination.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was more of raillery in it
than menace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And you
say, then," continued the king, "that it was positively De
Guiche's horse that was found dead?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Quite positive,
sire."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did that
astonish you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire; for your
majesty will remember that, at the last hunt, M. de Saint-Maure
had a horse killed under him, and in the same way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, but that one was
ripped open."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of course, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Had Guiche's horse been
ripped open like M. de Saint-Maure's horse, I should not have
been astonished."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp opened his eyes
very wide.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Am I mistaken," resumed
the king, "was it not in the frontal bone that De Guiche's horse
was struck?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You must
admit, Monsieur de Manicamp, that that is a very singular place
for a wild boar to attack."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are aware, sire,
that the horse is a very intelligent animal, and he doubtless
endeavoured to defend himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But a horse defends
himself with his heels and not with his head."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, the
terrified horse may have slipped or fallen down," said Manicamp,
"and the boar, you understand sire, the boar - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I understand that perfectly, as far
as the horse is concerned; but how about his rider?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! that, too, is
simple enough; the boar left the horse and attacked the rider;
and, as I have already had the honor of informing your majesty,
shattered De Guiche's hand at the very moment he was about to
discharge his second pistol at him, and then, with a gouge of his
tusk, made that terrible hole in his chest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing is more likely;
really, Monsieur de Manicamp, you are wrong in placing so little
confidence in your own eloquence, and you can tell a story most
admirably."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty is
exceedingly kind," said Manicamp, saluting him in the most
embarrassed manner.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "From this day
henceforth, I will prohibit any gentleman attached to my court
going out to a similar encounter.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Really, one might just as well
permit duelling."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp started, and
moved as if he were about to withdraw.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Is your majesty satisfied?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Delighted; but do not
withdraw yet, Monsieur de Manicamp," said Louis, "I have
something to say to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, well!" thought
D'Artagnan, "there is another who is not up to the mark;" and he
uttered a sigh which might signify, "Oh! the men of <i style=

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>now?</i>"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment an usher
lifted up the curtain before the door, and announced the king's
physician.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" exclaimed Louis,
"here comes Monsieur Valot, who has just been to see M. de

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

uncomfortable than ever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In this way, at least,"
added the king, "our conscience will be quite clear."<span style=

turned pale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan

still increasing anger of the king attained certain limits.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

continued the king, "that it is useless to deny the thing any

D'Artagnan, "an excellent fellow, upon my word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

who is the most accomplished gentleman in France, knows quite as

Place de Gr&egrave;ve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

enemy - not to avoid meeting his executioner!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

may be so," said Louis XIV.; "I am desirous of suggesting a means

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

hand your sword to the captain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

between him and D'Artagnan.<span style=

permit me to say a word?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

delighted, perhaps, at the bottom of his heart, for some one to

far.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Manicamp, you are a

asks you for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp was keen-witted
enough, and perfectly understood that he had done quite
sufficient to produce a good opinion of his conduct; it was now
only a question of persevering in such a manner as to regain the
good graces of the king. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Speak, monsieur," he said to Saint-Aignan; "I have on my own
behalf done all that my conscience told me to do; and it must
have been very importunate," he added, turning towards the king,
"since its mandates led me to disobey your majesty's commands;
but your majesty will forgive me, I hope, when you learn that I
was anxious to preserve the honor of a lady."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

indeed."</p>

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, everything which

D'Artagnan, as he left the room, "I had an indifferent opinion of

esteem her very highly - but because a lady was the object of the
quarrel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And I intend

himself of too exalted a position to undertake her defense."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"I, sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You told me in the

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Manicamp opened the

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan glanced
at Valot and Saint-Aignan, as much as to say, "Well! did I not
tell you so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king led
Manicamp to the door, and then in a low tone of voice said: "See
that M. de Guiche takes good care of himself, and particularly
that he recovers as soon as possible; I am very desirous of
thanking him in the name of every lady, but let him take special
care that he does not begin again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Were he to die a
hundred times, sire, he would begin again if your majesty's honor
were in any way called in question."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>This remark was
direct enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But we
have already said that the incense of flattery was very pleasing
to the king, and, provided he received it, he was not very
particular as to its quality.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well, very
well," he said, as he dismissed Manicamp, "I will see De Guiche
myself, and make him listen to reason."<span style=

the king turned round towards the three spectators of this scene,

your sight is so imperfect? - you, whose eyes are generally so
very good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My sight bad,

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It must be the
case since your majesty says so; but in what respect, may I
ask?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, with regard

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly.<span

tracks of two horses, to have detected the footprints of two men;

assert took place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Nothing of the sort occurred; pure illusion on your part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! ah!" said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly the same
thing with the galloping to and fro of the horses, and the other
indications of a struggle.<span style=

against the wild boar, and absolutely nothing else; only the
struggle was a long and a terrible one, it seems."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! ah!" continued
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And when I think
that I almost believed it for a moment - but, then, you told it
with such confidence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I admit, sire,
that I must have been very short-sighted," said D'Artagnan, with
a readiness of humor which delighted the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You do admit it,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Admit it, sire,
most assuredly I do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So now that you
see the thing - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In quite a
different light from that in which I saw it half an hour
ago."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And to what, then,
do you attribute this difference in your opinion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! a very simple
thing, sire; half an hour ago I returned from Bois-Rochin, where
I had nothing to light me but a stupid stable lantern - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"While now?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"While now I have
all the wax-lights of your cabinet, and more than that, your
majesty's own eyes, which illuminate everything, like the blazing
sun at noonday."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king began to
laugh; and Saint-Aignan broke out into convulsions of
merriment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is precisely
like M. Valot," said D'Artagnan, resuming the conversation where
the king had left off; "he has been imagining all along, that not
only was M. de Guiche wounded by a bullet, but still more, that
he extracted it, even, from his chest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Upon my word,"
said Valot, "I assure you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Now, did you not
believe that?" continued D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," said Valot;
"not only did I believe it, but, at this very moment, I would
swear it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, my dear
doctor, you have dreamt it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have dreamt
it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"M. de Guiche's
wound - a mere dream; the bullet, a dream.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So, take my advice, and prate no
more about it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well said,"
returned the king, "M. d'Artagnan's advice is sound.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not speak of your dream to any
one, Monsieur Valot, and, upon the word of a gentleman, you will
have no occasion to repent it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Good evening, gentlemen; a very sad
affair, indeed, is a wild boar-hunt!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A very serious
thing, indeed," repeated D'Artagnan, in a loud voice, "is a wild
boar-hunt!" and he repeated it in every room through which he
passed; and left the ch&acirc;teau, taking Valot with him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And now we are
alone," said the king to Saint-Aignan, "what is the name of De
Guiche's adversary?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan looked
at the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! do not
hesitate," said the king; "you know that I am bound beforehand to
forgive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"De Wardes," said
Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good," said
Louis XIV.; and then, retiring to his own room, added to himself,
"To forgive is not to forget."</p>

M</span>anicamp quitted the king's apartment, delighted at having
succeeded so well, when, just as he reached the bottom of the
staircase and was passing a doorway, he felt that some one
suddenly pulled him by the sleeve.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He turned round and recognized
Montalais, who was waiting for him in the passage, and who, in a
very mysterious manner, with her body bent forward, and in a low
tone of voice, said to him, "Follow me, monsieur, and without any
delay, if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where to,
mademoiselle?" inquired Manicamp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

followed me without requiring any explanation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Manicamp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Lead on,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Montalais, who ran before him as light as Galatea.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Manicamp, as he followed his guide, "I do not think that stories

something else."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

on.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

thought Manicamp, "to have need of one's head and legs at the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At last, however, they
arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame had just
finished undressing, and was in a most elegant <i style=

be understood that she had changed her dress before she had any
idea of being subjected to the emotions now agitating her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was waiting with the most
restless impatience; and Montalais and Manicamp found her
standing near the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
At the sound of their approaching footsteps, Madame came forward
to meet them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" she said, "at
last!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

replied Montalais.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

greatest respect; Madame signed to Montalais to withdraw, and she
immediately obeyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Madame followed her with her eyes, in silence, until the door
closed behind her, and then, turning towards Manicamp, said,
"What is the matter? - and is it true, as I am told, Monsieur de

ch&acirc;teau?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

strongest antipathy to duels?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

but a duel with a wild beast is not answerable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

me by supposing that I credit the absurd fable, with what object
I cannot tell, respecting M. de Guiche having been wounded by a
wild boar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, no,
monsieur; the real truth is known, and, in addition to the
inconvenience of his wound, M. de Guiche runs the risk of losing
his liberty if not his life."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas!<span style=

what is to be done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What did you say to
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I told him how M. de

the Bois-Rochin; how M. de Guiche fired at it, and how, in fact,
the furious brute dashed at De Guiche, killed his horse, and
grievously wounded himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the king believed
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Monsieur de Manicamp; you surprise me very much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And Madame walked up and
down the room, casting a searching look from time to time at
Manicamp, who remained motionless and impassible in the same
place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At last she
stopped.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet," she said,
"every one here seems unanimous in giving another cause for this
wound."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What cause, Madame?"
said Manicamp; "may I be permitted, without indiscretion, to ask
your highness?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You ask such a
question!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You, M. de

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, Madame! his
intimate friend - yes; confidant - no.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche is a man who can keep his
own secrets, who has some of his own certainly, but who never
breathes a syllable about them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche is discretion itself,
Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well, then; those
secrets which M. de Guiche keeps so scrupulously, I shall have
the pleasure of informing you of," said the princess, almost
spitefully; "for the king may possibly question you a second
time, and if, on the second occasion, you were to repeat the same
story to him, he possibly might not be very well satisfied with
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, Madame, I think
your highness is mistaken with regard to the king.<span style=

with me, I assure you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, permit me
to assure you, Monsieur de Manicamp, it only proves one thing,
which is, that his majesty is very easily satisfied."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I think your highness
is mistaken in arriving at such an opinion; his majesty is well
known not to be contented except with very good reason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And do you suppose that
he will thank you for your officious falsehood, when he will
learn to-morrow that M. de Guiche had, on behalf of his friend M.
de Bragelonne, a quarrel which ended in a hostile meeting?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A quarrel on M. de

expression in the world; "what does your royal highness do me the
honor to tell me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is there
astonishing in that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M.
de Guiche is susceptible, irritable, and easily loses his
temper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On the contrary,
Madame, I know M. de Guiche to be very patient, and never
susceptible or irritable except upon very good grounds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But is not friendship a
just ground?" said the princess.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, certainly, Madame;
and particularly for a heart like his."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good; you will not
deny, I suppose, that M. de Bragelonne is M. de Guiche's good
friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A great friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, M. de
Guiche has taken M. de Bragelonne's part; and as M. de Bragelonne
was absent and could not fight, he fought for him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp began to smile,
and moved his head and shoulders very slightly, as much as to
say, "Oh, if you will positively have it so - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But speak, at all
events," said the princess, out of patience; "speak!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of course; it is quite

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp remained
silent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

understand, do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

excuse me, but I dare not - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame, exasperated; "very well, then, wait one moment, I will
dare."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

exclaimed Manicamp, as if in great dismay, "be careful of what

monsieur, that, if I happened to be a man, you would challenge

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of Mademoiselle de la

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What makes you start in

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because you detest
injustice, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And according to your
account, then, it would be an injustice to prevent the king
arranging his love affairs as he pleases."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will intercede,
however, in M. de Guiche's favor?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are mad, monsieur,"
said the princess, in a haughty tone of voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On the contrary, I am
in the most perfect possession of my senses; and I repeat, you
will defend M. de Guiche before the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why should I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because the cause of M.
de Guiche is your own, Madame," said Manicamp, with ardor
kindling in his eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you mean by
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean, Madame, that,
with respect to the defense which Monsieur de Guiche undertook in
M. de Bragelonne's absence, I am surprised that your highness has
not detected a pretext in La Valli&egrave;re's name having been
brought forward."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A pretext?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But a pretext for what?" repeated
the princess, hesitatingly, for Manicamp's steady look had just
revealed something of the truth to her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I trust, Madame," said
the young man, "I have said sufficient to induce your highness
not to overwhelm before his majesty my poor friend, De Guiche,
against whom all the malevolence of a party bitterly opposed to
your own will now be directed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You mean, on the
contrary, I suppose, that all those who have no great affection
for Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re, and even, perhaps, a few
of those who have some regard for her, will be angry with the
comte?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, Madame! why will
you push your obstinacy to such an extent, and refuse to open
your ears and listen to the counsel of one whose devotion to you
is unbounded?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Must I
expose myself to the risk of your displeasure, - am I really to
be called upon to name, contrary to my own wish, the person who
was the real cause of this quarrel?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The person?" said
Madame, blushing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Must I," continued
Manicamp, "tell you how poor De Guiche became irritated, furious,
exasperated beyond all control, at the different rumors now being
circulated about this person?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Must I, if you persist in this
willful blindness, and if respect should continue to prevent me
naming her, - must I, I repeat, recall to your recollection the
various scenes which Monsieur had with the Duke of Buckingham,
and the insinuations which were reported respecting the duke's
exile?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Must I remind you
of the anxious care the comte always took in his efforts to
please, to watch, to protect that person for whom alone he lives,
- for whom alone he breathes?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will do so; and when I shall have
made you recall all the particulars I refer to, you will perhaps
understand how it happened that the comte, having lost all
control over himself, and having been for some time past almost
harassed to death by De Wardes, became, at the first
disrespectful expression which the latter pronounced respecting
the person in question, inflamed with passion, and panted only
for an opportunity of avenging the affront."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The princess concealed
her face with her hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Monsieur, monsieur!" she exclaimed; "do you know what you are
saying, and to whom you are speaking?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And so, Madame,"
pursued Manicamp, as if he had not heard the exclamations of the
princess, "nothing will astonish you any longer, - neither the
comte's ardor in seeking the quarrel, nor his wonderful address
in transferring it to an quarter foreign to your own personal
interests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That latter
circumstance was, indeed, a marvelous instance of tact and
perfect coolness, and if the person in whose behalf the comte so
fought and shed his blood does, in reality, owe some gratitude to
the poor wounded sufferer, it is not on account of the blood he
has shed, or the agony he has suffered, but for the steps he has
taken to preserve from comment or reflection an honor which is
more precious to him than his own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" cried Madame, as
if she had been alone, "is it possible the quarrel was on my
account!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp felt he could
now breathe for a moment - and gallantly had he won the right to
do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame, on her
side, remained for some time plunged in a painful reverie.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her agitation could be seen by
her quick respiration, by her drooping eyelids, by the frequency
with which she pressed her hand upon her heart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, in her, coquetry was not so
much a passive quality, as, on the contrary, a fire which sought
for fuel to maintain itself, finding anywhere and everywhere what
it required.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If it be as you
assert," she said, "the comte will have obliged two persons at
the same time; for Monsieur de Bragelonne also owes a deep debt
of gratitude to M. de Guiche - and with far greater reason,
indeed, because everywhere, and on every occasion, Mademoiselle
de la Valli&egrave;re will be regarded as having been defended by
this generous champion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp perceived that
there still remained some lingering doubt in the princess's
heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A truly admirable
service, indeed," he said, "is the one he has rendered to
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A truly admirable service to M. de
Bragelonne!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The duel has
created a sensation which, in some respects, casts a dishonorable
suspicion upon that young girl; a sensation, indeed, which will
embroil her with the vicomte.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The consequence is that De Wardes's
pistol-bullet has had three results instead of one; it destroys
at the same time the honor of a woman, the happiness of a man,
and, perhaps, it has wounded to death one of the best gentlemen
in France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, Madame!
your logic is cold - even calculating; it always condemns - it
never absolves."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp's concluding
words scattered to the winds the last doubt which lingered, not
in Madame's heart, but in her mind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was no longer a princess full of
scruples, nor a woman with her ever-returning suspicions, but one
whose heart has just felt the mortal chill of a wound.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Wounded to death!" she
murmured, in a faltering voice, "oh, Monsieur de Manicamp! did
you not say, wounded to death?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp returned no
other answer than a deep sigh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And so you said that
the comte is dangerously wounded?" continued the princess.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, Madame; one of his
hands is shattered, and he has a bullet lodged in his
breast."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Gracious heavens!"
resumed the princess, with a feverish excitement, "this is
horrible!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur de
Manicamp! a hand shattered, do you say, and a bullet in his
breast?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And that coward!
that wretch! that assassin, De Wardes, did it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp seemed overcome
by a violent emotion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
had, in fact, displayed no little energy in the latter part of
his speech.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for
Madame, she entirely threw aside all regard for the formal
observances of propriety society imposes; for when, with her,
passion spoke in accents either of anger or sympathy, nothing
could restrain her impulses.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame approached Manicamp, who had
subsided in a chair, as if his grief were a sufficiently powerful
excuse for his infraction of the laws of etiquette.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur," she said, seizing him by
the hand, "be frank with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp looked up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is M. de Guiche in
danger of death?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Doubly so, Madame," he
replied; "in the first place on account of the hemorrhage which
has taken place, an artery having been injured in the hand; and
next, in consequence of the wound in his breast, which may, the
doctor is afraid, at least, have injured some vital part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He may die, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Die, yes, Madame; and
without even having had the consolation of knowing that you have
been told of his devotion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will tell him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; are you not his
friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I? oh, no, Madame; I
will only tell M. de Guiche - if, indeed, he is still in a
condition to hear me - I will only tell him what I have seen;
that is, your cruelty to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, monsieur, you will
not be guilty of such barbarity!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Indeed, Madame, I shall
speak the truth, for nature is very energetic in a man of his
age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The physicians are
clever men, and if, by chance, the poor comte should survive his
wound, I should not wish him to die of a wound of the heart,
after surviving one of the body."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Manicamp rose, and with an
expression of profoundest respect, seemed to be desirous of
taking leave.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At least, monsieur,"
said Madame, stopping him with almost a suppliant air, "you will
be kind enough to tell me in what state your wounded friend is,
and who is the physician who attends him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As regards the state he
is in, Madame, he is seriously ill; his physician is M. Valot,
his majesty's private medical attendant.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Valot is moreover assisted by a
professional friend, to whose house M. de Guiche has been
carried."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! he is not in the
ch&acirc;teau?" said Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas, Madame! the poor
fellow was so ill, that he could not even be conveyed
thither."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Give me the address,
monsieur," said the princess, hurriedly; "I will send to inquire
after him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Rue du Feurre; a
brick-built house, with white outside blinds.<span style=

door."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are returning to
your wounded friend, Monsieur de Manicamp?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes,
Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to do me a service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

orders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do what you intended to
do; return to M. de Guiche, send away all those whom you may find
there, and have the kindness yourself to go away too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us waste no time in
useless explanations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Accept the fact as I present it to you; see nothing in it beyond
what is really there, and ask nothing further than what I tell
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am going to send
one of my ladies, perhaps two, because it is now getting late; I
do not wish them to see you, or rather I do not wish you to see
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These are scruples
you can understand - you particularly, Monsieur de Manicamp, who
seem capable of divining so much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, Madame, perfectly;
I can even do better still, - I will precede, or rather walk, in
advance of your attendants; it will, at the same time, be the
means of showing them the way more accurately, and of protecting
them, if occasion arises, though there is no probability of their
needing protection."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And, by this means,
then, they would be sure of entering without difficulty, would
they not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certainly, Madame; for
as I should be the first to pass, I thus remove any difficulties
that might chance to be in the way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Go, go, Monsieur de Manicamp, and
wait at the bottom of the staircase."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I go at once,
Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp paused.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "When you hear the
footsteps of two women descending the stairs, go out, and,
without once turning round, take the road which leads to where
the poor count is lying."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But if, by any
mischance, two other persons were to descend, and I were to be
mistaken?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will
hear one of the two clap her hands together softly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Manicamp turned round,
bowed once more, and left the room, his heart overflowing with
joy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, he knew
very well that the presence of Madame herself would be the best
balm to apply to his friend's wounds.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A quarter of an hour had hardly
elapsed when he heard the sound of a door opened softly, and
closed with like precaution.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He listened to the light footfalls
gliding down the staircase, and then hard the signal agreed
upon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He immediately went
out, and, faithful to his promise, bent his way, without once
turning his head, through the streets of Fontainebleau, towards
the doctor's dwelling.</p>

T</span>wo women, their figures completely concealed by their
mantles, and whose masks effectually hid the upper portion of
their faces, timidly followed Manicamp's steps.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the first floor, behind curtains
of red damask, the soft light of a lamp placed upon a low table
faintly illumined the room, at the other extremity of which, on a
large bedstead supported by spiral columns, around which curtains
of the same color as those which deadened the rays of the lamp
had been closely drawn, lay De Guiche, his head supported by
pillows, his eyes looking as if the mists of death were
gathering; his long black hair, scattered over the pillow, set
off the young man's hollow temples.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was easy to see that fever was
the chief tenant of the chamber.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche was dreaming.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His wandering mind was pursuing,
through gloom and mystery, one of those wild creations delirium
engenders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two or three
drops of blood, still liquid, stained the floor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Manicamp hurriedly ran up the
stairs, but paused at the threshold of the door, looked into the
room, and seeing that everything was perfectly quiet, he advanced
towards the foot of the large leathern armchair, a specimen of
furniture of the reign of Henry IV., and seeing that the nurse,
as a matter of course, had dropped off to sleep, he awoke her,
and begged her to pass into the adjoining room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, standing by the
side of the bed, he remained for a moment deliberating whether it
would be better to awaken Guiche, in order to acquaint him with
the good news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, as he
began to hear behind the door the rustling of silk dresses and
the hurried breathing of his two companions, and as he already
saw that the curtain screening the doorway seemed on the point of
being impatiently drawn aside, he passed round the bed and
followed the nurse into the next room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as he had disappeared the
curtain was raised, and his two female companions entered the
room he had just left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The one who entered first made a gesture to her companion, which
riveted her to the spot where she stood, close to the door, and
then resolutely advanced towards the bed, drew back the curtains
along the iron rod, and threw them in thick folds behind the head
of the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She gazed
upon the comte's pallid face; remarked his right hand enveloped
in linen whose dazzling whiteness was emphasized by the
counterpane patterned with dark leaves thrown across the
couch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She shuddered as
she saw a stain of blood growing larger and larger upon the
bandages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young man's
breast was uncovered, as though for the cool night air to assist
his respiration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A narrow
bandage fastened the dressings of the wound, around which a
purplish circle of extravasated blood was gradually increasing in
size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A deep sigh broke
from her lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She leaned
against one of the columns of the bed, and gazed, through the
apertures in her mask, upon the harrowing spectacle before
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A hoarse harsh groan
passed like a death-rattle through the comte's clenched
teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The masked lady
seized his left hand, which scorched like burning coals.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But at the very moment she
placed her icy hand upon it, the action of the cold was such that
De Guiche opened his eyes, and by a look in which revived
intelligence was dawning, seemed as though struggling back again
into existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first
thing upon which he fixed his gaze was this phantom standing
erect by his bedside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
that sight, his eyes became dilated, but without any appearance
of consciousness in them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The lady thereupon made a sign to her companion, who had remained
at the door; and in all probability the latter had already
received her lesson, for in a clear tone of voice, and without
any hesitation whatever, she pronounced these words: - "Monsieur
le comte, her royal highness Madame is desirous of knowing how
you are able to bear your wound, and to express to you, by my
lips, her great regret at seeing you suffer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As she pronounced the
word Madame, Guiche started; he had not as yet remarked the
person to whom the voice belonged, and he naturally turned
towards the direction whence it preceded.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, as he felt the cold hand still
resting on his own, he again turned towards the motionless figure
beside him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Was it you
who spoke, madame?" he asked, in a weak voice, "or is there
another person in beside you in the room?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," replied the
figure, in an almost unintelligible voice, as she bent down her
head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said the wounded
man, with a great effort, "I thank you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tell Madame that I no longer regret
to die, since she has remembered me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At the words "to die,"
pronounced by one whose life seemed to hang on a thread, the
masked lady could not restrain her tears, which flowed under the
mask, and appeared upon her cheeks just where the mask left her
face bare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If De Guiche
had been in fuller possession of his senses, he would have seen
her tears roll like glistening pearls, and fall upon his
bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lady, forgetting
that she wore her mask, raised her hand as though to wipe her
eyes, and meeting the rough velvet, she tore away her mask in
anger, and threw it on the floor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the unexpected apparition before
him, which seemed to issue from a cloud, De Guiche uttered a cry
and stretched his arms towards her; but every word perished on
his lips, and his strength seemed utterly abandoning him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His right hand, which had
followed his first impulse, without calculating the amount of
strength he had left, fell back again upon the bed, and
immediately afterwards the white linen was stained with a larger
spot than before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the
meantime, the young man's eyes became dim, and closed, as if he
were already struggling with the messenger of death; and then,
after a few involuntary movements, his head fell back motionless
on his pillow; his face grew livid.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lady was frightened; but on this
occasion, contrary to what is usually the case, fear
attracted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She leaned
over the young man, gazed earnestly, fixedly at his pale, cold
face, which she almost touched, then imprinted a rapid kiss upon
De Guiche's left hand, who, trembling as if an electric shock had
passed through him, awoke a second time, opened his large eyes,
incapable of recognition, and again fell into a state of complete
insensibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come,"
she said to her companion, "we must not remain here any longer; I
shall be committing some folly or other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame, Madame, your
highness is forgetting your mask!" said her vigilant
companion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pick it up," replied
her mistress, as she tottered almost senseless towards the
staircase, and as the outer door had been left only half-closed,
the two women, light as birds, passed through it, and with
hurried steps returned to the palace.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One of the ascended towards Madame's
apartments, where she disappeared; the other entered the rooms
belonging to the maids of honor, namely, on the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>entresol</i>, and having reached
her own room, she sat down before a table, and without giving
herself time even to breathe, wrote the following letter:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This evening Madame has
been to see M. de Guiche.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Everything is going well on this side.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> See that your news is equally
exemplary, and do not forget to burn this paper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She folded the letter,
and leaving her room with every possible precaution, crossed a
corridor which led to the apartments appropriated to the
gentlemen attached to Monsieur's service.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She stopped before a door, under
which, having previously knocked twice in a short, quick manner,
she thrust the paper, and fled.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, returning to her own room, she
removed every trace of her having gone out, and also of having
written the letter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Amid
the investigations she was so diligently pursuing she perceived
on the table the mask which belonged to Madame, and which,
according to her mistress's directions, she had brought back but
had forgotten to restore to her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh, oh!" she said, "I must not
forget to do to-morrow what I have forgotten to-day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And she took hold of the
velvet mask by that part which covered the cheeks, and feeling
that her thumb was wet, looked at it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not only wet, but
reddened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The mask had
fallen upon one of the spots of blood which, we have already
said, stained the floor, and from that black velvet outside which
had accidentally come into contact with it, the blood had passed
through to the inside, and stained the white cambric lining.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh, oh!" said Montalais, for
doubtless our readers have already recognized her by these
various maneuvers, "I shall not give back this mask; it is far
too precious now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And rising from her
seat, she ran towards a box made of maple wood, which inclosed
different articles of toilette and perfumery.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No, not here," she said, "such a
treasure must not be abandoned to the slightest chance of
detection."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then, after a moment's
silence, and with a smile that was peculiarly her own, she added:
- "Beautiful mask, stained with the blood of that brave knight,
you shall go and join that collection of wonders, La
Valli&egrave;re's and Raoul's letters, that loving collection,
indeed, which will some day or other form part of the history of
France, of European royalty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You shall be placed under M.
Malicorne's care," said the laughing girl, as she began to
undress herself, "under the protection of that worthy M.
Malicorne," she said, blowing out the taper, "who thinks he was
born only to become the chief usher of Monsieur's apartments, and
whom I will make keeper of the records and historiographer of the
house of Bourbon, and of the first houses in the kingdom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let him grumble now, that
discontented Malicorne," she added, as she drew the curtains and
fell asleep.</p>

T</span>he next day being agreed upon for the departure, the
king, at eleven o'clock precisely, descended the grand staircase
with the two queens and Madame, in order to enter his carriage
drawn by six horses, that were pawing the ground in impatience at
the foot of the staircase.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The whole court awaited the royal
appearance in the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>Fer-&agrave;-cheval</i> crescent,
in their travelling costumes; the large number of saddled horses
and carriages of ladies and gentlemen of the court, surrounded by
their attendants, servants, and pages, formed a spectacle whose
brilliancy could scarcely be equalled.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king entered his carriage with
the two queens; Madame was in the same one with Monsieur.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The maids of honor followed
their example, and took their seats, two by two, in the carriages
destined for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
weather was exceedingly warm; a light breeze, which, early in the
morning, all had thought would have proved sufficient to cool the
air, soon became fiercely heated by the rays of the sun, although
it was hidden behind the clouds, and filtered through the heated
vapor which rose from the ground like a scorching wind, bearing
particles of fine dust against the faces of the travelers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame was the first to
complain of the heat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Monsieur's only reply was to throw himself back in the carriage
as though about to faint, and to inundate himself with scents and
perfumes, uttering the deepest sighs all the while; whereupon
Madame said to him, with her most amiable expression: - "Really,
Monsieur, I fancied that you would have been polite enough, on
account of the terrible heart, to have left me my carriage to
myself, and to have performed the journey yourself on
horseback."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ride on horseback!"
cried the prince, with an accent of dismay which showed how
little idea he had of adopting this unnatural advice; "you cannot
suppose such a thing, Madame!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My skin would peel off if I were to
expose myself to such a burning breeze as this."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame began to
laugh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You can take my
parasol," she said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the trouble of
holding it!" replied Monsieur, with the greatest coolness;
"besides, I have no horse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What, no horse?"
replied the princess, who, if she did not secure the solitude she
required, at least obtained the amusement of teasing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No horse!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are mistaken, Monsieur; for I
see your favorite bay out yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My bay horse!"
exclaimed the prince, attempting to lean forward to look out of
the door; but the movement he was obliged to make cost him so
much trouble that he soon hastened to resume his immobility.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said Madame;
"your horse, led by M. de Malicorne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Poor beast," replied
the prince; "how warm it must be!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And with these words he
closed his eyes, like a man on the point of death.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame, on her side, reclined
indolently in the other corner of the carriage, and closed her
eyes also, not, however, to sleep, but to think more at her
ease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime the
king, seated in the front seat of his carriage, the back of which
he had yielded up to the two queens, was a prey to that feverish
contrariety experienced by anxious lovers, who, without being
able to quench their ardent thirst, are ceaselessly desirous of
seeing the loved object, and then go away partially satisfied,
without perceiving they have acquired a more insatiable thirst
than ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king,
whose carriage headed the procession, could not from the place he
occupied perceive the carriages of the ladies and maids of honor,
which followed in a line behind it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, he was obliged to answer
the eternal questions of the young queen, who, happy to have with
her "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>her dear husband</i>,"
as she called him in utter forgetfulness of royal etiquette,
invested him with all her affection, stifled him with her
attentions, afraid that some one might come to take him from her,
or that he himself might suddenly take a fancy to quit her
society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of Austria,
whom nothing at that moment occupied except the occasional cruel
throbbings in her bosom, looked pleased and delighted, and
although she perfectly realized the king's impatience,
tantalizingly prolonged his sufferings by unexpectedly resuming
the conversation at the very moment the king, absorbed in his own
reflections, began to muse over his secret attachment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Everything seemed to combine -
not alone the little teasing attentions of the queen, but also
the queen-mother's interruptions - to make the king's position
almost insupportable; for he knew not how to control the restless
longings of his heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
first, he complained of the heat - a complaint merely preliminary
to others, but with sufficient tact to prevent Maria Theresa
guessing his real object.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Understanding the king's remark literally, she began to fan him
with her ostrich plumes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But the heat passed away, and the king then complained of cramps
and stiffness in his legs, and as the carriages at that moment
stopped to change horses, the queen said: - "Shall I get out with
you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I too feel tired of
sitting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We can walk on a
little distance; the carriage will overtake us, and we can resume
our places presently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king frowned; it is
a hard trial a jealous woman makes her husband submit to whose
fidelity she suspects, when, although herself a prey to jealousy,
she watches herself so narrowly that she avoids giving any
pretext for an angry feeling.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, therefore, in the present
case, could not refuse; he accepted the offer, alighted from the
carriage, gave his arm to the queen, and walked up and down with
her while the horses were being changed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As he walked along, he cast an
envious glance upon the courtiers, who were fortunate enough to
be on horseback.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
queen soon found out that the promenade she had suggested
afforded the king as little pleasure as he had experienced from
driving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She accordingly
expressed a wish to return to her carriage, and the king
conducted her to the door, but did not get in with her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He stepped back a few paces,
and looked along the file of carriages for the purpose of
recognizing the one in which he took so strong an interest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the door of the sixth
carriage he saw La Valli&egrave;re's fair countenance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As the king thus stood
motionless, wrapt in thought, without perceiving that everything
was ready, and that he alone was causing the delay, he heard a
voice close beside him, addressing him in the most respectful
manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was M.
Malicorne, in a complete costume of an equerry, holding over his
left arm the bridles of a couple of horses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty asked for
a horse, I believe," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A horse?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have you one of my horses here?"
inquired the king, trying to remember the person who addressed
him, and whose face was not as yet familiar to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," replied
Malicorne, "at all events I have a horse here which is at your
majesty's service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And Malicorne pointed at
Monsieur's bay horse, which Madame had observed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was a beautiful creature royally
caparisoned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is not one of my
horses, monsieur," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, it is a horse out
of his royal highness's stables; but he does not ride when the
weather is as hot as it is now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis did not reply, but
approached the horse, which stood pawing the ground with its
foot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne hastened
to hold the stirrup for him, but the king was already in the
saddle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Restored to
good-humor by this lucky accident, the king hastened towards the
queen's carriage, where he was anxiously expected; and
notwithstanding Maria Theresa's thoughtful and preoccupied air,
he said: "I have been fortunate enough to find this horse, and I
intend to avail myself of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I felt stifled in the carriage.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Adieu, ladies."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Then bending gracefully
over the arched neck of his beautiful steed, he disappeared in a
second.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Anne of Austria
leaned forward, in order to look after him as he rode away; he
did not get very far, for when he reached the sixth carriage, he
reined in his horse suddenly and took off his hat.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He saluted La Valli&egrave;re, who
uttered a cry of surprise as she saw him, blushing at the same
time with pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Montalais, who occupied the other seat in the carriage, made the
king a most respectful bow.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then, with all the tact of a
woman, she pretended to be exceedingly interested in the
landscape, and withdrew herself into the left-hand corner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The conversation between the
king and La Valli&egrave;re began, as all lovers' conversations
generally do, namely, by eloquent looks and by a few words
utterly devoid of common sense.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king explained how warm he had
felt in his carriage, so much so indeed that he could almost
regard the horse he then rode as a blessing thrown in his
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And," he added, "my
benefactor is an exceedingly intelligent man, for he seemed to
guess my thoughts intuitively.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have now only one wish, that of
learning the name of the gentleman who so cleverly assisted his
king out of his dilemma, and extricated him from his cruel
position."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais, during this
colloquy, the first words of which had awakened her attention,
had slightly altered her position, and contrived so as to meet
the king's look as he finished his remark.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It followed very naturally that the
king looked inquiringly as much at her as at La Valli&egrave;re;
she had every reason to suppose that it was herself who was
appealed to, and consequently might be permitted to answer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She therefore said: "Sire, the
horse which your majesty is riding belongs to Monsieur, and was
being led by one of his royal highness's gentlemen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what is that
gentleman's name, may I ask, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. de Malicorne,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The name produced its
usual effect, for the king repeated it smilingly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire," replied
Aure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Stay, it is the
gentleman who is galloping on my left hand;" and she pointed out
Malicorne, who, with a very sanctified expression, was galloping
by the side of the carriage, knowing perfectly well that they
were talking of him at that very moment, but sitting in his
saddle as if he were deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," said the king,
"that is the gentleman; I remember his face, and will not forget
his name;" and the king looked tenderly at La
Valli&egrave;re.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aure had now nothing
further to do; she had let Malicorne's name fall; the soil was
good; all that was now left to be done was to let the name take
root, and the event would bear fruit in due season.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She consequently threw herself back
in her corner, feeling perfectly justified in making as many
agreeable signs of recognition as she liked to Malicorne, since
the latter had had the happiness of pleasing the king.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As will readily be believed,
Montalais was not mistaken; and Malicorne, with his quick ear and
his sly look, seemed to interpret her remark as "All goes on
well," the whole being accompanied by a pantomimic action, which
he fancied conveyed something resembling a kiss.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas! mademoiselle,"
said the king, after a moment's pause, "the liberty and freedom
of the country is soon about to cease; your attendance on Madame
will be more strictly enforced, and we shall see each other no
more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty is too
much attached to Madame," replied Louise, "not to come and see
her very frequently; and whenever your majesty may chance to pass
across the apartments - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said the king, in
a tender voice, which was gradually lowered in its tone, "to
perceive is not to see, and yet it seems that it would be quite
sufficient for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louise did not answer a
syllable; a sigh filled her heart almost to bursting, but she
stifled it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You exercise a great
control over yourself," said the king to Louise, who smiled upon
him with a melancholy expression.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Exert the strength you have in
loving fondly," he continued, "and I will bless Heaven for having
bestowed it on you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re still
remained silent, but raised her eyes, brimful of affection,
toward the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis,
as if overcome by this burning glance, passed his hand across his
forehead, and pressing the sides of his horse with his knees,
made him bound several paces forward.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re, leaning back in
her carriage, with her eyes half closed, gazed fixedly upon the
king, whose plumes were floating in the air; she could not but
admire his graceful carriage, his delicate and nervous limbs
which pressed his horse's sides, and the regular outline of his
features, which his beautiful curling hair set off to great
advantage, revealing occasionally his small and well-formed
ear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact the poor
girl was in love, and she reveled in her innocent affection.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In a few moments the king was
again by her side.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you not perceive,"
he said, "how terribly your silence affects me?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! mademoiselle, how pitilessly
inexorable you would become if you were ever to resolve to break
off all acquaintance with any one; and then, too, I think you
changeable; in fact - in fact, I dread this deep affection which
fills my whole being."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire, you are
mistaken," said La Valli&egrave;re; "if ever I love, it will be
for all my life."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If you love, you say,"
exclaimed the king; "you do <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>not</i> love now, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She hid her face in her
hands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You see," said the
king, "that I am right in accusing you; you must admit you are
changeable, capricious, a coquette, perhaps."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no! sire, be
perfectly satisfied as to that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, I say again; no, no!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Promise me, then, that
to me you will always be the same."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! always, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That you will never
show any of that severity which would break my heart, none of
that fickleness of manner which would be worse than death to
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! no, no."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well, then! but
listen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I like promises,
I like to place under the guarantee of an oath, under the
protection of Heaven, in fact, everything which interests my
heart and my affections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Promise me, or rather swear to me, that if in the life we are
about to commence, a life which will be full of sacrifice,
mystery, anxiety, disappointment, and misunderstanding; swear to
me that if we should in any way deceive, or misunderstand each
other, or should judge each other unjustly, for that indeed would
be criminal in love such as ours; swear to me, Louise - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She trembled with
agitation to the very depths of her heart; it was the first time
she had heard her name pronounced in that manner by her royal
lover.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for the king,
taking off his glove, and placing his hand within the carriage,
he continued: - "Swear, that never in all our quarrels will we
allow one night even to pass by, if any misunderstanding should
arise between us, without a visit, or at least a message, from

Austria, in a severe tone; for, in her ears, the word "duel,"

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the duel?" inquired the young queen, animated by a secret

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame, triumphantly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"The gentlemen in question were conversing about the virtue of a
particular lady belonging to the court.<span style=

a very second-rate person compared to her; the other pretended
that the lady in question was an imitation of Venus alluring
Mars; and thereupon the two gentlemen fought as fiercely as
Hector and Achilles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

inquired Anne of Austria abruptly.<span style=

plain-looking creature."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the devoted servant he is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

allowing her jealous feeling to escape.</p>

defended except at the expense of Venus," replied Madame.<span

perfect innocence of Mars, and no doubt affirmed that it was all
a mere boast."</p>

Anne of Austria, quietly, "spread the report that Venus was
within her rights, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame, "you shall pay dearly for the wound you have given that
noblest - best of men!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And she began to attack De Wardes with the greatest bitterness;
thus discharging her own and De Guiche's debt, with the assurance
that she was working the future ruin of her enemy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She said so much, in fact, that had
Manicamp been there, he would have regretted he had shown such
firm regard for his friend, inasmuch as it resulted in the ruin

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I see nothing in the
whole affair but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one</i>

the queen-mother.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

her work with perfect indifference of manner, while Madame
listened eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

understand what you said just now about the danger of coquetry,"
resumed Anne of Austria.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame hastened to say, "that if the girl had not been a
coquette, Mars would not have thought at all about her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The repetition of this
word Mars brought a passing color to the queen's face; but she
still continued her work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

in my court, gentlemen should be set against each other in this
manner," said Anne of Austria, calmly.<span style=

perhaps, in days when the divided nobility had no other
rallying-point than mere gallantry.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At that time women, whose sway was
absolute and undivided, were privileged to encourage men's valor
by frequent trials of their courage.<span style=

one master in France, and to him every instinct of the mind,

fixed smiles only to be observed on royal lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame was herself a
princess great in every respect, great in intelligence, great by

"She is one of my maids of honor," she replied, with a bow.</p>

Maria Theresa, in the same tone, "it is your affair, my sister,

Anne of Austria, "no disturbance, I beg.<span style=

never had the queen-mother been unkind to her when such was the

grace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She therefore
advanced towards the queen-mother with that soft and gentle smile

approach sufficiently close, Anne of Austria signed to her to

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re sank
at the queen's feet, who turned her back upon her.<span style=

Madame, who laughed in her face.<span style=

fine sentiments; she is an inexhaustible well of tenderness and
heroic expressions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One
can easily see, young lady, that you have cultivated your mind in
the society of crowned heads."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re felt
struck to the heart; she became, not whiter, but as white as a
lily, and all her strength forsook her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I wished to inform
you," interrupted the queen, disdainfully, "that if you continue
to nourish such feelings, you will humiliate us to such a degree
that we shall be ashamed of appearing before you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Be simple in your manners.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
pressed her hand over her heart, which was wrung with a fresh

in store for you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

not reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Where is the

Madame, "where the report of this young lady's success will not
fail to reach him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

La Valli&egrave;re in despair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

opinion - for girls have strange views and fancies at times -

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
ceased to hear the queen, who pitilessly added: "I will send you
somewhere, by yourself, where you will be able to indulge in a
little serious reflection.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Reflection calms the ardor of the
blood, and swallows up the illusions of youth.<span style=

been saying?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

everything your majesty supposes.<span style=

despair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I love, I
respect your majesty so much."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It would be far better
not to respect me at all," said the queen, with a chilling irony
of manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It would be
far better if you were not innocent.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you presume to suppose that I
should be satisfied simply to leave you unpunished if you had
committed the fault?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, madame! you are
killing me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No acting, if you
please, or I will precipitate the <i style=

return to your own apartment, and I trust my lesson may be of
service to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame!" said La
Valli&egrave;re to the Duchess d'Orl&eacute;ans, whose hands she
seized in her own, "do you, who are so good, intercede for
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I!" replied the latter,
with an insulting joy, "I - good! - Ah, mademoiselle, you think
nothing of the kind;" and with a rude, hasty gesture she repulsed
the young girl's grasp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re,
instead of giving way, as from her extreme pallor and her tears
the two princesses possibly expected, suddenly resumed her calm
and dignified air; she bowed profoundly, and left the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well!" said Anne of
Austria to Madame, "do you think she will begin again?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I always suspect those
gentle, patient characters," replied Madame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Nothing is more full of courage
than a patient heart, nothing more self-reliant than a gentle
spirit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I feel I may almost
venture to assure you she will think twice before she looks at
the god Mars again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So long as she does not
obtain the protection of his buckler I do not care," retorted
Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A proud, defiant look of
the queen-mother was the reply to this objection, which was by no
means deficient in <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>finesse</i>; and both of them,
almost sure of their victory, went to look for Maria Theresa, who
had been waiting for them with impatience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was about half-past
six in the evening, and the king had just partaken of
refreshment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He lost no
time; but the repast finished, and business matters settled, he
took Saint-Aignan by the arm, and desired him to lead the way to
La Valli&egrave;re's apartments.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The courtier uttered an
exclamation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, what is that
for?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is a habit you
will have to adopt, and in order to adopt a habit, one must make
a beginning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, sire!" said
Saint-Aignan, "it is hardly possible: for every one can be seen
entering or leaving those apartments.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If, however, some pretext or other
were made use of - if your majesty, for instance, would wait
until Madame were in her own apartments - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No pretext; no
delays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have had enough
of these impediments and mysteries; I cannot perceive in what
respect the king of France dishonors himself by conversing with
an amiable and clever girl.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Evil be to him who evil thinks."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will your majesty
forgive an excess of zeal on my part?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak freely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How about the
queen?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True, true; I always
wish the most entire respect to be shown to her majesty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, then, this evening only
will I pay Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re a visit, and after
to-day I will make use of any pretext you like.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To-morrow we will devise all sorts
of means; to-night I have no time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Saint-Aignan made no
reply; he descended the steps, preceding the king, and crossed
the different courtyards with a feeling of shame, which the
distinguished honor of accompanying the king did not remove.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The reason was that
Saint-Aignan wished to stand well with Madame, as well as with
the queens, and also, that he did not, on the other hand, want to
displease Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re: and in order to
carry out so many promising affairs, it was difficult to avoid
jostling against some obstacle or other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, the windows of the young
queen's rooms, those of the queen-mother's, and of Madame
herself, looked out upon the courtyard of the maids of
honor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To be seen,
therefore, accompanying the king, would be effectually to quarrel
with three great and influential princesses - whose authority was
unbounded - for the purpose of supporting the ephemeral credit of
a mistress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The unhappy
Saint-Aignan, who had not displayed a very great amount of
courage in taking La Valli&egrave;re's part in the park of
Fontainebleau, did not feel any braver in the broad day-light,
and found a thousand defects in the poor girl which he was most
eager to communicate to the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But his trial soon finished, - the
courtyards were crossed; not a curtain was drawn aside, nor a
window opened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king
walked hastily, because of his impatience, and the long legs of
Saint-Aignan, who preceded him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the door, however, Saint-Aignan
wished to retire, but the king desired him to remain; a delicate
consideration, on the king's part, which the courtier could very
well have dispensed with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He had to follow Louis into La Valli&egrave;re's apartment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as the king arrived
the young girl dried her tears, but so precipitately that the
king perceived it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
questioned her most anxiously and tenderly, and pressed her to
tell him the cause of her emotion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing is the matter,
sire," she said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet you were
weeping?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no,
indeed, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Look, Saint-Aignan, and
tell me if I am mistaken."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Saint-Aignan ought to
have answered, but he was too much embarrassed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At all events your eyes
are red, mademoiselle," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The dust of the road
merely, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no; you no longer
possess the air of supreme contentment which renders you so
beautiful and so attractive.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You do not look at me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why avoid my gaze?" he said, as she
turned aside her head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"In Heaven's name, what is the matter?" he inquired, beginning to
lose command over himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing at all, sire;
and I am perfectly ready to assure your majesty that my mind is
as free form anxiety as you could possibly wish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your mind at ease, when
I see you are embarrassed at the slightest thing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Has any one annoyed you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I insist upon knowing
if such really be the case," said the prince, his eyes
sparkling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No one, sire, no one
has in any way offended me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, pray
resume your gentle air of gayety, or that sweet melancholy look
which I so loved in you this morning; for pity's sake, do
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire, yes."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king
tapped the floor impatiently with his foot, saying, "Such a
change is positively inexplicable."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he looked at Saint-Aignan, who
had also remarked La Valli&egrave;re's peculiar lethargy, as well
as the king's impatience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was futile for the
king to entreat, and as useless for him to try to overcome her
depression: the poor girl was completely overwhelmed, - the
appearance of an angel would hardly have awakened her from her
torpor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king saw in her
repeated negative replies a mystery full of unkindness; he began
to look round the apartment with a suspicious air.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There happened to be in La
Valli&egrave;re's room a miniature of Athos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king remarked that this portrait
bore a strong resemblance to Bragelonne, for it had been taken
when the count was quite a young man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He looked at it with a threatening
air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re,
in her misery far indeed from thinking of this portrait, could
not conjecture the cause of the king's preoccupation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet the king's mind was occupied
with a terrible remembrance, which had more than once taken
possession of his mind, but which he had always driven away.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He recalled the intimacy
existing between the two young people from their birth, their
engagement, and that Athos himself had come to solicit La
Valli&egrave;re's hand for Raoul.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He therefore could not but suppose
that on her return to Paris, La Valli&egrave;re had found news
from London awaiting her, and that this news had counterbalanced
the influence he had been enabled to exert over her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He immediately felt himself stung,
as it were, by feelings of the wildest jealousy; and again
questioned her, with increased bitterness.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re could not reply,
unless she were to acknowledge everything, which would be to
accuse the queen, and Madame also; and the consequence would be,
that she would have to enter into an open warfare with these two
great and powerful princesses.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She thought within herself that as
she made no attempt to conceal from the king what was passing in
her own mind, the king ought to be able to read in her heart, in
spite of her silence; and that, had he really loved her, he would
have understood and guessed everything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What was sympathy, then, if not that
divine flame which possesses the property of enlightening the
heart, and of saving lovers the necessity of an expression of
their thoughts and feelings?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She maintained her silence,
therefore, sighing, and concealing her face in her hands.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These sighs and tears, which
had at first distressed, then terrified Louis XIV., now irritated
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He could not bear
opposition, - the opposition which tears and sighs exhibited, any
more than opposition of any other kind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His remarks, therefore, became
bitter, urgent, and openly aggressive in their nature.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was a fresh cause of
distress for the poor girl.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From that very circumstance,
therefore, which she regarded as an injustice on her lover's
part, she drew sufficient courage to bear, not only her other
troubles, but this one also.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king next began to
accuse her in direct terms.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re did not even
attempt to defend herself; she endured all his accusations
without according any other reply than that of shaking her head;
without any other remark than that which escapes the heart in
deep distress - a prayerful appeal to Heaven for help.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But this ejaculation, instead
of calming the king's displeasure, rather increased it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He, moreover, saw himself
seconded by Saint-Aignan, for Saint-Aignan, as we have observed,
having seen the storm increasing, and not knowing the extent of
the regard of which Louis XIV. was capable, felt, by
anticipation, all the collected wrath of the three princesses,
and the near approach of poor La Valli&egrave;re's downfall, and
he was not true knight enough to resist the fear that he himself
might be dragged down in the impending ruin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan did not reply to the
king's questions except by short, dry remarks, pronounced
half-aloud; and by abrupt gestures, whose object was to make
things worse, and bring about a misunderstanding, the result of
which would be to free him from the annoyance of having to cross
the courtyards in open day, in order to follow his illustrious
companion to La Valli&egrave;re's apartments.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime the king's anger
momentarily increased; he made two or three steps towards the
door as if to leave the room, but returned.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young girl did not, however,
raise her head, although the sound of his footsteps might have
warned her that her lover was leaving her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He drew himself up, for a moment,
before her, with his arms crossed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For the last time,
mademoiselle," he said, "will you speak?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will you assign a reason for this
change, this fickleness, for this caprice?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What can I say?"
murmured La Valli&egrave;re.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do you not see, sire, that I am
completely overwhelmed at this moment; that I have no power of
will, or thought, or speech?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is it so difficult,
then, to speak the truth?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You could have told me the whole truth in fewer words than those
in which you have expressed yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the truth about
what, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "About everything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re was
just on the point of revealing the truth to the king, her arms
made a sudden movement as if they were about to open, but her
lips remained silent, and her hands again fell listlessly by her
side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The poor girl had
not yet endured sufficient unhappiness to risk the necessary
revelation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I know
nothing," she stammered out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" exclaimed the
king, "this is no longer mere coquetry, or caprice, it is
treason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And this time nothing
could restrain him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
impulse of his heart was not sufficient to induce him to turn
back, and he darted out of the room with a gesture full of
despair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan
followed him, wishing for nothing better than to quit the

A</span>s soon as the king was gone La Valli&egrave;re raised
herself from the ground, and stretched out her arms, as if to
follow and detain him, but when, having violently closed the
door, the sound of his retreating footsteps could be heard in the
distance, she had hardly sufficient strength left to totter
towards and fall at the foot of her crucifix.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There she remained, broken-hearted,
absorbed, and overwhelmed by her grief, forgetful and indifferent
to everything but her profound sorrow; - a grief she only vaguely
realized - as though by instinct.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the midst of this wild tumult of
thoughts, La Valli&egrave;re heard her door open again; she
started, and turned round, thinking it was the king who had
returned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was
deceived, however, for it was Madame who appeared at the
door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What did she now
care for Madame!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Again
she sank down, her head supported by her <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>prie-Dieu</i> chair.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was Madame, agitated, angry, and
threatening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But what was
that to her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Mademoiselle," said the princess, standing before La
Valli&egrave;re, "this is very fine, I admit, to kneel and pray,
and make a pretense of being religious; but however submissive
you may be in your address to Heaven, it is desirable that you
should pay some little attention to the wishes of those who reign
and rule here below."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
raised her head painfully in token of respect.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

continued Madame, "a certain recommendation was addressed to you,
I believe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re's
fixed and wild gaze showed how complete her forgetfulness or
ignorance was.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The queen recommended
you," continued Madame, "to conduct yourself in such a manner
that no one could be justified in spreading any reports about
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
darted an inquiring look towards her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will not," continued
Madame, "allow my household, which is that of the first princess
of the blood, to set an evil example to the court; you would be
the cause of such an example.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I beg you to understand, therefore,
in the absence of any witness of your shame - for I do not wish
to humiliate you - that you are from this moment at perfect
liberty to leave, and that you can return to<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> your mother at Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re could
not sink lower, nor could she suffer more than she had already
suffered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her countenance
did not even change, but she remained kneeling with her hands
clasped, like the figure of the Magdalen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did you hear me?" said
Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A shiver, which passed
through her whole frame, was La Valli&egrave;re's only
reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And as the victim
gave no other signs of life, Madame left the room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then, her very respiration
suspended, and her blood almost congealed, as it were, in her
veins, La Valli&egrave;re by degrees felt that the pulsation of
her wrists, her neck, and temples, began to throb more and more
painfully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These
pulsations, as they gradually increased, soon changed into a
species of brain fever, and in her temporary delirium she saw the
figures of her friends contending with her enemies, floating
before her vision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She
heard, too, mingled together in her deafened ears, words of
menace and words of fond affection; she seemed raised out of her
existence as though it were upon the wings of a mighty tempest,
and in the dim horizon of the path along which her delirium
hurried her, she saw the stone which covered her tomb upraised,
and the grim, appalling texture of eternal night revealed to her
distracted gaze.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the
horror of the dream which possessed her senses faded away, and
she was again restored to the habitual resignation of her
character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A ray of hope
penetrated her heart, as a ray of sunlight streams into the
dungeon of some unhappy captive.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her mind reverted to the journey
from Fontainebleau, she saw the king riding beside her carriage,
telling her that he loved her, asking for her love in return,
requiring her to swear, and himself to swear too, that never
should an evening pass by, if ever a misunderstanding were to
arise between them, without a visit, a letter, a sign of some
kind, being sent, to replace the troubled anxiety of the evening
with the calm repose of the night.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was the king who had suggested
that, who had imposed a promise on her, and who had sworn to it
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was
impossible, therefore, she reasoned, that the king should fail in
keeping the promise which he had himself exacted from her,
unless, indeed, Louis was a despot who enforced love as he
enforced obedience; unless, too, the king were so indifferent
that the first obstacle in his way was sufficient to arrest his
further progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king, that kind protector, who by a word, a single word, could
relieve her distress of mind, the king even joined her
persecutors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! his
anger could not possibly last.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now that he was alone, he would be
suffering all that she herself was a prey to.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But he was not tied hand and foot as
she was; he could act, could move about, could come to her, while
she could do nothing but wait.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the poor girl waited and waited,
with breathless anxiety - for she could not believe it possible
that the king would not come.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was now about
half-past ten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He would
either come to her, or write to her, or send some kind word by M.
de Saint-Aignan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he
were to come, oh! how she would fly to meet him; how she would
thrust aside that excess of delicacy which she now discovered was
misunderstood; how eagerly she would explain: "It is not I who do
not love you - it is the fault of others who will not allow me to
love you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then it
must be confessed that she reflected upon it, and also the more
she reflected, Louis appeared to her to be less guilty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, he was ignorant of
everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What must he
have thought of the obstinacy with which she remained
silent?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Impatient and
irritable as the king was known to be, it was extraordinary that
he had been able to preserve his temper so long.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet, had it been her own case,
she undoubtedly would not have acted in such a manner; she would
have understood - have guessed everything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, but she was nothing but a poor
simple-minded girl, and not a great and powerful monarch.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! if he would but come, if
he would but come! - how eagerly she would forgive him for all he
had just made her suffer! how much more tenderly she would love
him because she had so cruelly suffered!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so she sat, with her head bent
forward in eager expectation towards the door, her lips slightly
parted, as if - and Heaven forgive her for the mental
exclamation! - they were awaiting the kiss which the king's lips
had in the morning so sweetly indicated, when he pronounced the
word <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>love!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the king did not come, at least
he would write; it was a second chance; a chance less delightful
certainly than the other, but which would show an affection just
as strong, only more timid in its nature.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! how she would devour his letter,
how eager she would be to answer it! and when the messenger who
had brought it had left her, how she would kiss it, read it over
and over again, press to her heart the lucky paper which would
have brought her ease of mind, tranquillity, and perfect
happiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At all events,
if the king did not come, if the king did not write, he could not
do otherwise than send Saint-Aignan, or Saint-Aignan could not do
otherwise than come of his own accord.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Even if it were a third person, how
openly she would speak to him; the royal presence would not be
there to freeze her words upon her tongue, and then no suspicious
feeling would remain a moment longer in the king's heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Everything with La
Valli&egrave;re, heart and look, body and mind, was concentrated
in eager expectation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She
said to herself that there was an hour left in which to indulge
hope; that until midnight struck, the king might come, or write
or send; that at midnight only would every expectation vanish,
every hope be lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Whenever she heard any stir in the palace, the poor girl fancied
she was the cause of it; whenever she heard any one pass in the
courtyard below she imagined they were messengers of the king
coming to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Eleven
o'clock struck, then a quarter-past eleven; then half-past.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The minutes dragged slowly on
in this anxiety, and yet they seemed to pass too quickly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And now, it struck a quarter
to twelve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Midnight -
midnight was near, the last, the final hope that remained.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With the last stroke of the
clock, the last ray of light seemed to fade away; and with the
last ray faded her final hope.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so, the king himself had
deceived her; it was he who had been the first to fail in keeping
the oath which he had sworn that very day; twelve hours only
between his oath and his perjured vow; it as not long, alas! to
have preserved the illusion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so, not only did the king not
love her, but he despised her whom every one ill-treated, he
despised her to the extent even of abandoning her to the shame of
an expulsion which was equivalent to having an ignominious
sentence passed on her; and yet, it was he, the king himself, who
was the first cause of this ignominy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A bitter smile, the only symptom of
anger which during this long conflict had passed across the
angelic face, appeared upon her lips.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What, in fact, now remained on earth
for her, after the king was lost to her?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Heaven still remained, and her
thoughts flew thither.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
She prayed that the proper course for her to follow might be
suggested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It is from
Heaven," she thought, "that I expect everything; it is from
Heaven I ought to expect everything."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And she looked at her crucifix with
a devotion full of tender love.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "There," she said, "hangs before me
a Master who never forgets and never abandons those who neither
forget nor abandon Him; it is to Him alone that we must sacrifice
ourselves."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And,
thereupon, could any one have gazed into the recesses of that
chamber, they would have seen the poor despairing girl adopt a
final resolution, and determine upon one last plan in her
mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, as her knees
were no longer able to support her, she gradually sank down upon
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>prie-Dieu</i>, and with
her head pressed against the wooden cross, her eyes fixed, and
her respiration short and quick, she watched for the earliest
rays of approaching daylight.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At two o'clock in the morning she
was still in the same bewilderment of mind, or rather the same
ecstasy of feeling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her
thoughts had almost ceased to hold communion with things of the
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And when she saw
the pale violet tints of early dawn visible over the roofs of the
palace, and vaguely revealing the outlines of the ivory crucifix
which she held embraced, she rose from the ground with a new-born
strength, kissed the feet of the divine martyr, descended the
staircase leading from the room, and wrapped herself from head to
foot in a mantle as she went along.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She reached the wicket at the very
moment the guard of the musketeers opened the gate to admit the
first relief-guard belonging to one of the Swiss regiments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then, gliding behind the
soldiers, she reached the street before the officer in command of
the patrol had even thought of asking who the young girl was who
was making her escape from the palace at so early an hour.</p>

L</span>a Valli&egrave;re followed the patrol as it left the
courtyard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The patrol
bent its steps towards the right, by the Rue St. Honor&eacute;,
and mechanically La Valli&egrave;re turned to the left.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her resolution was taken - her
determination fixed; she wished to betake herself to the convent
of the Carmelites at Chaillot, the superior of which enjoyed a
reputation for severity which made the worldly-minded people of
the court tremble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La
Valli&egrave;re had never seen Paris, she had never gone out on
foot, and so would have been unable to find her way even had she
been in a calmer frame of mind than was then the case; and this
may explain why she ascended, instead of descending, the Rue St.
Honor&eacute;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her only
thought was to get away from the Palais Royal, and this she was
doing; she had heard it said that Chaillot looked out upon the
Seine, and she accordingly directed her steps towards the
Seine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She took the Rue
de Coq, and not being able to cross the Louvre, bore towards the
church of Saint Germain l'Auxerrois, proceeding along the site of
the colonnade which was subsequently built there by
Perrault.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In a very short
time she reached the quays.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her steps were rapid and agitated;
she scarcely felt the weakness which reminded her of having
sprained her foot when very young, and which obliged her to limp
slightly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At any other
hour in the day her countenance would have awakened the
suspicions of the least clear-sighted, attracted the attention of
the most indifferent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
at half-past two in the morning, the streets of Paris are almost,
if not quite, deserted, and scarcely is any one to be seen but
the hard-working artisan on his way to earn his daily bread or
the roistering idlers of the streets, who are returning to their
homes after a night of riot and debauchery; for the former the
day was beginning, and for the latter it was just closing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re was afraid
of both faces, in which her ignorance of Parisian types did not
permit her to distinguish the type of probity from that of
dishonesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
appearance of misery alarmed her, and all she met seemed either
vile or miserable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her
dress, which was the same she had worn during the previous
evening, was elegant even in its careless disorder; for it was
the one in which she had presented herself to the queen-mother;
and, moreover, when she drew aside the mantle which covered her
face, in order to enable her to see the way she was going, her
pallor and her beautiful eyes spoke an unknown language to the
men she met, and, unconsciously, the poor fugitive seemed to
invite the brutal remarks of the one class, or to appeal to the
compassion of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
La Valli&egrave;re still walked on in the same way, breathless
and hurried, until she reached the top of the Place de
Gr&egrave;ve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She stopped
from time to time, placed her hand upon her heart, leaned against
a wall until she could breathe freely again, and then continued
on her course more rapidly than before.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On reaching the Place de
Gr&egrave;ve La Valli&egrave;re suddenly came upon a group of
three drunken men, reeling and staggering along, who were just
leaving a boat which they had made fast to the quay; the boat was
freighted with wines, and it was apparent that they had done
ample justice to the merchandise.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were celebrating their
convivial exploits in three different keys, when suddenly, as
they reached the end of the railing leading down to the quay,
they found an obstacle in their path, in the shape of this young
girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re
stopped; while they, on their part, at the appearance of the
young girl dressed in court costume, also halted, and seizing
each other by the hand, they surrounded La Valli&egrave;re,
singing, -</p>

her, and wished to prevent her passing; she tried to do so
several times, but her efforts were useless.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Her limbs failed her; she felt she
was on the point of falling, and uttered a cry of terror.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the same moment the circle
which surrounded her was suddenly broken through in a most
violent manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One of
her insulters was knocked to the left, another fell rolling over
and over to the right, close to the water's edge, while the third
could hardly keep his feet.<span style=

face to face with the young girl, with threatening brow and hand
raised to carry out his threat.<span style=

uniform, made their escape with what speed their staggering limbs

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan did not
reply; he could tell, merely by the tone of a voice, when a
resolution was real or not.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He rather bore along rather than
accompanied La Valli&egrave;re, until they perceived the elevated
ground of Chaillot.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What house are you
going to, mademoiselle?" inquired D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To the Carmelites?"
repeated D'Artagnan, in amazement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; and since Heaven
has directed you towards me to give me your support on my road,
accept both my thanks and my adieux."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To the Carmelites!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your adieux!<span style=

exclaimed D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What, you!!!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was in this "you," which
we have marked by three notes of exclamation in order to render
it as expressive as possible, - there was, we repeat, in this
"you" a complete poem; it recalled to La Valli&egrave;re her old
recollections of Blois, and her new recollections of
Fontainebleau; it said to her, "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>You</i>, who might be happy with
Raoul; <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>, who might
be powerful with Louis; <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur," she
said, "I am going to devote myself to the service of Heaven; and
to renounce the world entirely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But are you not
mistaken with regard to your vocation, - are you not mistaken in
supposing it to be the will of Heaven?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, since Heaven has
been pleased to throw you in my way.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Had it not been for you, I should
certainly have sunk from fatigue on the road, and since Heaven, I
repeat, has thrown you in my way, it is because it has willed
that I should carry out my intention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said D'Artagnan,
doubtingly, "that is a rather subtle distinction, I think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whatever it may be,"
returned the young girl, "I have acquainted you with the steps I
have taken, and with my fixed resolution.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, now, I have one last favor to
ask of you, even while I return you my thanks.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king is entirely ignorant of my
flight from the Palais Royal, and is ignorant also of what I am
about to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king ignorant, you
say!" exclaimed D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Take care, mademoiselle; you are
not aware of what you are doing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No one ought to do anything with
which the king is unacquainted, especially those who belong to
the court."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I no longer belong to
the court, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan looked at the
young girl with increasing astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do not be uneasy,
monsieur," she continued: "I have well calculated everything; and
were it not so, it would now be too late to reconsider my
resolution, - all is decided."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, mademoiselle,
what do you wish me to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In the name of that
sympathy which misfortune inspires, by your generous feeling, and
by your honor as a gentleman, I entreat you to promise me one
thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Name it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Swear to me, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, that you will not tell the king that you have seen
me, and that I am at the Carmelites."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will not swear that,"
said D'Artagnan, shaking his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because I know the
king, I know you, I know myself even, nay, the whole human race,
too well; no, no, I will not swear that!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case," cried La
Valli&egrave;re, with an energy of which one would hardly have
thought her capable, "instead of the blessing which I should have
implored for you until my dying day, I will invoke a curse, for
you are rendering me the most miserable creature that ever
lived."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> We have already observed
that D'Artagnan could easily recognize the accents of truth and
sincerity, and he could not resist this last appeal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He saw by her face how bitterly she
suffered from a feeling of degradation, he remarked her trembling
limbs, how her whole slight and delicate frame was violently
agitated by some internal struggle, and clearly perceived that
resistance might be fatal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I will do as you wish, then," he
said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Be satisfied,
mademoiselle, I will say nothing to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! thanks, thanks,"
exclaimed La Valli&egrave;re, "you are the most generous man
breathing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And in her extreme
delight she seized hold of D'Artagnan's hands and pressed them
between her own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan, who felt himself quite overcome, said: "This is
touching, upon my word; she begins where others leave off."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And La Valli&egrave;re,
who, in the bitterness of her distress, had sunk upon the ground,
rose and walked towards the convent of the Carmelites, which
could now, in the dawning light, be perceived just before
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan followed
her at a distance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
entrance-door was half-open; she glided in like a shadow, and
thanking D'Artagnan by a parting gesture, disappeared from his
sight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When D'Artagnan
found himself quite alone, he reflected very profoundly upon what
had just taken place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Upon my word," he said, "this looks very much like what is
called a false position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
To keep such a secret as that, is to keep a burning coal in one's
breeches-pocket, and trust that it may not burn the stuff.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet, not to keep it when I
have sworn to do so is dishonorable.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It generally happens that some
bright idea or other occurs to me as I am going along; but I am
very much mistaken if I shall not, now, have to go a long way in
order to find the solution of this affair.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, but which way to go?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! towards Paris, of course;
that is the best way, after all.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only one must make haste, and in
order to make haste four legs are better than two, and I,
unhappily, only have two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
'A horse, a horse,' as I heard them say at the theatre in London,
'my kingdom for a horse!'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And now I think of it, it need not cost me so much as that, for
at the Barri&egrave;re de la Conf&eacute;rence there is a guard
of musketeers, and instead of the one horse I need, I shall find
ten there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> So, in pursuance of this
resolution, which he adopted with his usual rapidity, D'Artagnan
immediately turned his back upon the heights of Chaillot, reached
the guard-house, took the fastest horse he could find there, and
was at the palace in less than ten minutes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was striking five as he reached
the Palais Royal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king, he was told, had gone to bed at his usual hour, having been
long engaged with M. Colbert, and, in all probability, was still
sound asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come,"
said D'Artagnan, "she spoke the truth; the king is ignorant of
everything; if he only knew one-half of what has happened, the
Palais Royal by this time would be turned upside down."</p>

W</span>hen the king left the apartments of the maids of honor,
he found Colbert awaiting him to take directions for the next
day's ceremony, as the king was then to receive the Dutch and
Spanish ambassadors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Louis XIV. had serious causes of dissatisfaction with the Dutch;
the States had already been guilty of many mean shifts and
evasions with France, and without perceiving or without caring
about the chances of a rupture, they again abandoned the alliance
with his Most Christian Majesty, for the purpose of entering into
all kinds of plots with Spain.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis XIV. at his accession, that is
to say, at the death of Cardinal Mazarin, had found this
political question roughly sketched out; the solution was
difficult for a young man, but as, at that time, the king
represented the whole nation, anything that the head resolved
upon, the body would be found ready to carry out.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Any sudden impulse of anger, the
reaction of young hot blood upon the brain, would be quite
sufficient to change an old form of policy and create another
system altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
part that diplomatists had to play in those days was that of
arranging among themselves the different <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coups-d'&eacute;tat</i> which their
sovereign masters might wish to effect.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis was not in that calm frame of
mind which was necessary to enable him to determine on a wise
course of policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Still
much agitated from the quarrel he had just had with La
Valli&egrave;re, he walked hastily into his cabinet, dimly
desirous of finding an opportunity of producing an explosion
after he had controlled himself for so long a time.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert, as he saw the king enter,
knew the position of affairs at a glance, understood the king's
intentions, and resolved therefore to maneuver a little.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When Louis requested to be
informed what it would be necessary to say on the morrow, Colbert
began by expressing his surprise that his majesty had not been
properly informed by M. Fouquet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "M. Fouquet," he said, "is perfectly
acquainted with the whole of this Dutch affair - he received the
dispatches himself direct."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king, who was
accustomed to hear M. Colbert speak in not over-scrupulous terms
of M. Fouquet, allowed this remark to pass unanswered, and merely
listened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert noticed
the effect it had produced, and hastened to back out, saying that
M. Fouquet was not on all occasions as blamable as at the first
glance might seem to be the case, inasmuch as at that moment he
was greatly occupied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king looked up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What do
you allude to?" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, men are but men,
and M. Fouquet has his defects as well as his great
qualities."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! defects, who is
without them, M. Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty, hardly,"
said Colbert, boldly; for he knew how to convey a good deal of
flattery in a light amount of blame, like the arrow which cleaves
the air notwithstanding its weight, thanks to the light feathers
which bear it up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king smiled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What defect has M. Fouquet,
then?" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Still the same, sire;
it is said he is in love."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In love! with
whom?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am not

gallantry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

since you speak of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

mentioned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I cannot now remember
whose, but I think it is one of Madame's maids of honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king started.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You know more than you like
to say, M. Colbert," he murmured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I assure you, no,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At all events, Madame's
maids of honor are all known, and in mentioning their names to
you, you will perhaps recollect the one you allude to."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whenever the name

my memory is like a coffer of bronze, the key of which I have
lost."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A dark cloud seemed to
pass over the mind as well as across the face of the king; then,
wishing to appear as if he were perfect master of himself and his
feelings, he said, "And now for the affair concerning
Holland."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Allied with

step, and that by the way of the Scheldt and the Meuse.<span

could with your cavalry sweep the earth from your dominions to
Brussels in a couple of days.<span style=

their own affairs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It would be far more
simple, I should imagine," replied the king, "to form a solid

the natural ally of your majesty is England, who has ships while
we have none; England, who can counteract Dutch influence in

better than myself, to exaggerate a little in order to obtain a
concession in your own favor.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

you speak of?" inquired Louis; "for if I allude to them, I ought
to know what to say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

cannot very well tell you - some overweeningly conceited device -
that is the sense of it; the words have little to do with the
thing itself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True," returned the
king; and he began to meditate; he had not thought of the list in
the least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The clock
struck half-past eleven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The king's face revealed a violent conflict between pride and
love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The political
conversation had dispelled a good deal of the irritation which
Louis had felt, and La Valli&egrave;re's pale, worn features, in
his imagination, spoke a very different language from that of the
Dutch medals, or the Batavian pamphlets.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He sat for ten minutes debating
within himself whether he should or should not return to La
Valli&egrave;re; but Colbert having with some urgency
respectfully requested that the list might be furnished him, the
king was ashamed to be thinking of mere matters of affection
where important state affairs required his attention.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He therefore dictated: the
queen-mother, the queen, Madame, Madame de Motteville, Madame de
Ch&acirc;tillon, Madame de Navailles; and, for the men, M. le
Prince, M. de Gramont, M. de Manicamp, M. de Saint-Aignan, and
the officers on duty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The ministers?" asked
Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I will leave at
once in order to get everything prepared; the orders will be at
the different residences to-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Say rather to-day,"
replied Louis mournfully, as the clock struck twelve.<span style=

Valli&egrave;re was almost dying from anguish and bitter
suffering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king's
attendants entered, it being the hour of his retirement to his
chamber; the queen, indeed, had been waiting for more than an
hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis accordingly
retreated to his bedroom with a sigh; but, as he sighed, he
congratulated himself on his courage, and applauded himself for
having been as firm in love as in affairs of state.</p>

D</span>'Artagnan had, with very few exceptions, learned almost
all of the particulars of what we have just been relating; for
among his friends he reckoned all the useful, serviceable people
in the royal household, - officious attendants who were proud of
being recognized by the captain of the musketeers, for the
captain's influence was very great; and then, in addition to any
ambitious vies they may have imagined he could promote, they were
proud of being regarded as worth being spoken to by a man as
brave as D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
this manner D'Artagnan learned every morning what he had not been
able either to see or to ascertain the night before, from the
simple fact of his not being ubiquitous; so that, with the
information he had been able by his own means to pick up during
the day, and with what he had gathered from others, he succeeded
in making up a bundle of weapons, which he was in the prudent
habit of using only when occasion required.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this way, D'Artagnan's two eyes
rendered him the same service as the hundred eyes of Argus.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Political secrets, bedside
revelations, hints or scraps of conversation dropped by the
courtiers on the threshold of the royal ante-chamber, in this way
D'Artagnan managed to ascertain, and to store away everything in
the vast and impenetrable mausoleum of his memory, by the side of
those royal secrets so dearly bought and faithfully
preserved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He therefore
knew of the king's interview with Colbert, and of the appointment
made for the ambassadors in the morning, and, consequently, that
the question of the medals would be brought up for debate; and,
while he was arranging and constructing the conversation upon a
few chance words which had reached his ears, he returned to his
post in the royal apartments, so as to be there at the very
moment the king awoke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
happened that the king rose very early, - proving thereby that
he, too, on his side, had slept but indifferently.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Towards seven o'clock, he
half-opened his door very gently.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan was at his post.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His majesty was pale, and
seemed wearied; he had not, moreover, quite finished
dressing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Send for M. de
Saint-Aignan," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Saint-Aignan was
probably awaiting a summons, for the messenger, when he reached
his apartment, found him already dressed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan hastened to the king in
obedience to the summons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
A moment afterwards the king and Saint-Aignan passed by together
- the king walking first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan went to the window which looked out upon the
courtyard; he had no need to put himself to the trouble of
watching in what direction the king went, for he had no
difficulty in guessing beforehand where his majesty was
going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, in fact,
bent his steps towards the apartments of the maids of honor, - a
circumstance which in no way astonished D'Artagnan, for he more
than suspected, although La Valli&egrave;re had not breathed a
syllable on the subject, that the king had some kind of
reparation to make.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Saint-Aignan followed him as he had done the previous evening,
rather less uneasy in his mind, though still slightly agitated,
for he fervently trusted that at seven o'clock in the morning
there might be only himself and the king awake amongst the august
guests at the palace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan stood at the window, careless and perfectly calm in
his manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One could
almost have sworn that he noticed nothing, and was utterly
ignorant who were these two hunters after adventures, passing
like shadows across the courtyard, wrapped up in their
cloaks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet, all the
while that D'Artagnan appeared not to be looking at them at all,
he did not for one moment lose sight of them, and while he
whistled that old march of the musketeers, which he rarely
recalled except under great emergencies, he conjectured and
prophesied how terrible would be the storm which would be raised
on the king's return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
fact, when the king entered La Valli&egrave;re's apartment and
found the room empty and the bed untouched, he began to be
alarmed, and called out to Montalais, who immediately answered
the summons; but her astonishment was equal to the king's.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All that she could tell his
majesty was, that she had fancied she had heard La
Valli&egrave;re's weeping during a portion of the night, but,
knowing that his majesty had paid her a visit, she had not dared
to inquire what was the matter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," inquired the
king, "where do you suppose she is gone?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," replied
Montalais, "Louise is of a very sentimental disposition, and as I
have often seen her rise at daybreak in order to go out into the
garden, she may, perhaps, be there now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This appeared probable,
and the king immediately ran down the staircase in search of the
fugitive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan saw
him grow very pale, and talking in an excited manner with his
companion, as he went towards the gardens; Saint-Aignan following
him, out of breath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan did not stir from the window, but went on whistling,
looking as if he saw nothing, yet seeing everything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come, come," he murmured, when the
king disappeared, "his majesty's passion is stronger than I
thought; he is now doing, I think, what he never did for
Mademoiselle de Mancini."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Transcriber's note: Marie de Mancini was a
former love of the king's.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had to abandon her for the
political advantages which the marriage to the Spanish Infanta,
Maria Theresa, afforded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
See <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>, Chapter XIII. - JB</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In a quarter of an hour
the king again appeared: he had looked everywhere, was completely
out of breath, and, as a matter of course, had not discovered
anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan,
who still followed him, was fanning himself with his hat, and in
a gasping voice, asking for information about La Valli&egrave;re
from such of the servants as were about, in fact from every one
he met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Among others he
came across Manicamp, who had arrived from Fontainebleau by easy
stages; for whilst others had performed the journey in six hours,
he had taken four and twenty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have you seen
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re?" Saint-Aignan asked him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Whereupon Manicamp,
dreamy and absent as usual, answered, thinking that some one was
asking him about De Guiche, "Thank you, the comte is a little
better."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And he continued on his
way until he reached the ante-chamber where D'Artagnan was, whom
he asked to explain how it was that the king looked, as he
thought, so bewildered; to which D'Artagnan replied that he was
quite mistaken, that the king, on the contrary, was as lively and
merry as he could possibly be.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In the midst of all
this, eight o'clock struck.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was usual for the king to take
his breakfast at this hour, for the code of etiquette prescribed
that the king should always be hungry at eight o'clock.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His breakfast was laid upon a
small table in his bedroom, and he ate very fast.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan, of whom he would not
lose sight, waited on the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then disposed of several military
audiences, during which he dispatched Saint-Aignan to see what he
could find out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then,
still occupied, full of anxiety, still watching Saint-Aignan's
return, who had sent out the servants in every direction, to make
inquires, and who had also gone himself, the hour of nine struck,
and the king forthwith passed into his large cabinet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As the clock was
striking nine the ambassadors entered, and as it finished, the
two queens and Madame made their appearance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There were three ambassadors from
Holland, and two from Spain.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king glanced at them, and then
bowed; and, at the same moment, Saint-Aignan entered, - an
entrance which the king regarded as far more important, in a
different sense, however, than that of ambassadors, however
numerous they might be, and from whatever country they came; and
so, setting everything aside, the king made a sign of
interrogation to Saint-Aignan, which the latter answered by a
most decisive negative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The king almost entirely lost his courage; but as the queens, the
members of the nobility who were present, and the ambassadors,
had their eyes fixed upon him, he overcame his emotion by a
violent effort, and invited the latter to speak.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whereupon one of the Spanish
deputies made a long oration, in which he boasted the advantages
which the Spanish alliance would offer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king interrupted
him, saying, "Monsieur, I trust that whatever is best for France
must be exceedingly advantageous for Spain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This remark, and
particularly the peremptory tone in which it was pronounced, made
the ambassadors pale, and brought the color into the cheeks of
the two queens, who, being Spanish, felt wounded in their pride
of relationship and nationality by this reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The Dutch ambassador
then began to address himself to the king, and complained of the
injurious suspicions which the king exhibited against the
government of his country.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king interrupted
him, saying, "It is very singular, monsieur, that you should come
with any complaint, when it is I rather who have reason to be
dissatisfied; and yet, you see, I do not complain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Complain, sire, and in
what respect?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king smiled
bitterly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Will you blame
me, monsieur," he said, "if I should happen to entertain
suspicions against a government which authorizes and protects
international impertinence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I tell you," resumed
the king, exciting himself by a recollection of his own personal
annoyance, rather than from political grounds, "that Holland is a
land of refuge for all who hate me, and especially for all who
malign me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You wish for proofs,
perhaps?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Very good; they
can be had easily enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Whence proceed all those vile and insolent pamphlets which
represent me as a monarch without glory and without authority?
your printing-presses groan under their number.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If my secretaries were here, I would
mention the titles of the works as well as the names of the
printers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," replied the
ambassador, "a pamphlet can hardly be regarded as the work of a
whole nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it just,
is it reasonable, that a great and powerful monarch like your
majesty should render a whole nation responsible for the crime of
a few madmen, who are, perhaps, only scribbling in a garret for a
few sous to buy bread for their family?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That may be the case, I
admit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But when the mint
itself, at Amsterdam, strikes off medals which reflect disgrace
upon me, is that also the crime of a few madmen?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Medals!" stammered out
the ambassador.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Medals," repeated the
king, looking at Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty," the
ambassador ventured, "should be quite sure - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king still looked at
Colbert; but Colbert appeared not to understand him, and
maintained an unbroken silence, notwithstanding the king's
repeated hints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan then approached the king, and taking a piece of money
out of his pocket, he placed it in the king's hands, saying, "<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>This</i> is the medal your
majesty alludes to."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king looked at it,
and with a look which, ever since he had become his own master,
was ever piercing as the eagle's, observed an insulting device
representing Holland arresting the progress of the sun, with this
inscription: "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>In conspectu
meo stetit sol</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In my presence the sun
stands still," exclaimed the king, furiously.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! you will hardly deny it now, I
suppose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the sun," said
D'Artagnan, "is this," as he pointed to the panels of the
cabinet, where the sun was brilliantly represented in every
direction, with this motto, "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nec pluribus impar</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Transcriber's note: "[A sun] not eclipsed by

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis's anger, increased
by the bitterness of his own personal sufferings, hardly required
this additional circumstance to foment it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every one saw, from the kindling
passion in the king's eyes, that an explosion was imminent.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A look from Colbert kept
postponed the bursting of the storm.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The ambassador ventured to frame
excuses by saying that the vanity of nations was a matter of
little consequence; that Holland was proud that, with such
limited resources, she had maintained her rank as a great nation,
even against powerful monarchs, and that if a little smoke had
intoxicated his countrymen, the king would be kindly disposed,
and would even excuse this intoxication.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king seemed as if he would be
glad of some suggestion; he looked at Colbert, who remained
impassible; then at D'Artagnan, who simply shrugged his
shoulders, a movement which was like the opening of the
flood-gates, whereby the king's anger, which he had restrained
for so long a period, now burst forth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As no one knew what direction his
anger might take, all preserved a dead silence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The second ambassador took advantage
of it to begin his excuses also.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While he was speaking, and while the
king, who had again gradually returned to his own personal
reflections, was automatically listening to the voice, full of
nervous anxiety, with the air of an absent man listening to the
murmuring of a cascade, D'Artagnan, on whose left hand
Saint-Aignan was standing, approached the latter, and, in a voice
which was loud enough to reach the king's ears, said: "Have you
heard the news?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What news?" said
Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king started, and
advanced his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What has happened to La
Valli&egrave;re?" inquired Saint-Aignan, in a tone which can
easily be imagined.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

going to take the veil."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The veil!" cried the
king, in the midst of the ambassador's discourse; but then,
mindful of the rules of etiquette, he mastered himself, still
listening, however, with rapt attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What order?" inquired
Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

her to the Carmelites."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

of her flight?" inquired Saint-Aignan.</p>

he exclaimed:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

itself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

hands, and turned pale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have something
further to add, M. d'Artagnan?" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You added that
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re had been driven away from the
court."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

also?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

like a man who is declining to say anything further.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king almost bounded
from his seat, regardless of ambassadors, ministers, courtiers,
queens, and politics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
queen-mother rose; she had heard everything, or, if she had not
heard everything, she had guessed it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame, almost fainting from anger
and fear, endeavored to rise as the queen-mother had done; but
she sank down again upon her chair, which by an instinctive
movement she made roll back a few paces.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Gentlemen," said the
king, "the audience is over; I will communicate my answer, or
rather my will, to Spain and to Holland;" and with a proud,
imperious gesture, he dismissed the ambassadors.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Take care, my son,"
said the queen-mother, indignantly, "you are hardly master of
yourself, I think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! madame," returned
the young lion, with a terrible gesture, "if I am not mater of
myself, I will be, I promise you, of those who do me a deadly
injury; come with me, M. d'Artagnan, come."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he quitted the room in the midst
of general stupefaction and dismay.<span style=

staircase, and was about to cross the courtyard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said D'Artagnan,
"your majesty mistakes the way."</p>

stables."</p>

for I have horses ready for your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

was a look, but this look promised more than the ambition of
three D'Artagnans could have dared to hope.</p>

A</span>lthough they had not been summoned, Manicamp and
Malicorne had followed the king and D'Artagnan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were both exceedingly
intelligent men; except that Malicorne was too precipitate, owing
to ambition, while Manicamp was frequently too tardy, owing to
indolence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On this
occasion, however, they arrived at precisely the proper
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Five horses were
in readiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two were
seized upon by the king and D'Artagnan, two others by Manicamp
and Malicorne, while a groom belonging to the stables mounted the
fifth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cavalcade set
off at a gallop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan had been very careful in his selection of the horses;
they were the very animals for distressed lovers - horses which
did not simply run, but flew.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Within ten minutes after their
departure, the cavalcade, amidst a cloud of dust, arrived at
Chaillot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king
literally threw himself off his horse; but notwithstanding the
rapidity with which he accomplished this maneuver, he found
D'Artagnan already holding his stirrup.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With a sign of acknowledgement to
the musketeer, he threw the bridle to the groom, and darted into
the vestibule, violently pushed open the door, and entered the
reception-room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Manicamp,
Malicorne, and the groom remained outside, D'Artagnan alone
following him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When he
entered the reception-room, the first object which met his gaze
was Louise herself, not simply on her knees, but lying at the
foot of a large stone crucifix.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young girl was stretched upon
the damp flag-stones, scarcely visible in the gloom of the
apartment, which was lighted only by means of a narrow window,
protected by bars and completely shaded by creeping plants.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the king saw her in this
state, he thought she was dead, and uttered a loud cry, which
made D'Artagnan hurry into the room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king had already passed one of
his arms round her body, and D'Artagnan assisted him in raising
the poor girl, whom the torpor of death seemed already to have
taken possession of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
D'Artagnan seized hold of the alarm-bell and rang with all his
might.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Carmelite
sisters immediately hastened at the summons, and uttered loud
exclamations of alarm and indignation at the sight of the two men
holding a woman in their arms.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The superior also hurried to the
scene of action, but far more a creature of the world than any of
the female members of the court, notwithstanding her austerity of
manners, she recognized the king at the first glance, by the
respect which those present exhibited for him, as well as by the
imperious and authoritative way in which he had thrown the whole
establishment into confusion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as she saw the king, she
retired to her own apartments, in order to avoid compromising her
dignity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But by one of
the nuns she sent various cordials, Hungary water, etc., etc.,
and ordered that all the doors should immediately be closed, a
command which was just in time, for the king's distress was fast
becoming of a most clamorous and despairing character.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had almost decided to send
for his own physician, when La Valli&egrave;re exhibited signs of
returning animation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
first object which met her gaze, as she opened her eyes, was the
king at her feet; in all probability she did not recognize him,
for she uttered a deep sigh full of anguish and distress.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis fixed his eyes
devouringly upon her face; and when, in the course of a few
moments, she recognized Louis, she endeavored to tear herself
from his embrace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, heavens!" she
murmured, "is not the sacrifice yet made?"</p>

king, "and it shall <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Notwithstanding her
weakness and utter despair, she rose from the ground, saying, "It
must be made, however; it must be; so do not stay me in my
purpose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I leave you to
sacrifice yourself!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I!

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, "I may as well go now.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as they begin to speak, we
may as well prevent there being any listeners."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he quitted the room, leaving the
lovers alone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Valli&egrave;re, "not another word, I implore you.<span style=

hope for - my salvation; do not destroy the glory and brightness
of your own future for a mere caprice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

only, that I can see clearly into your heart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "An inexplicable
impulse, foolish and unreasonable in its nature, may ephemerally
appear to offer a sufficient excuse for your conduct; but there
are duties imposed upon you which are incompatible with your
regard for a poor girl such as I am.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So, forget me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I forget you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You cannot love one

abandoned, last night, to the bitterness of death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Explain yourself, Louise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

yesterday morning?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To

Never to let midnight pass without offering me an opportunity of
reconciliation, if, by any chance, your anger should be roused
against me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! forgive me, Louise,
forgive me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was mad

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Be merciful, then, and leave me now to die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

needless."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Give me the names of
those you have cause to complain of."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire, to prefer against any one; no one but myself to

you are compromising yourself in speaking to me in such a
manner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! be careful, Louise,
in what you say; for you are reducing me to the darkness of
despair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire, sire, leave
me at least the protection of Heaven, I implore you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

shall not tear you from me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Save me, then," cried
the poor girl, "from those determined and pitiless enemies who
are thirsting to annihilate my life and honor too.<span style=

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the gentle-hearted girl,
forced, by her own bitter distress to accuse others, wrung her
hands in an uncontrollable agony of tears.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Louise; those - be they men or women - who yesterday drove you
away, shall to-morrow tremble before you - to-morrow, do I say?
nay, this very day I have already shown my displeasure - have
already threatened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is
in my power, even now, to hurl the thunderbolt I have hitherto
withheld.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louise, Louise,
you shall be bitterly revenged; tears of blood shall repay you
for the tears you have shed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Give me only the names of your

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

anger, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, those upon whom
your anger would be prepared to fall, would force you to draw
back your hand upraised to punish."</p>

themselves the enemies of the gentlest and best of
creatures."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, as he
said these words, Louis struck his fist violently against the
oaken wainscoting with a force which alarmed La Valli&egrave;re;
for his anger, owing to his unbounded power, had something
imposing and threatening in it, like the lightning, which may at
any time prove deadly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
She, who thought that her own sufferings could not be surpassed,
was overwhelmed by a suffering which revealed itself by menace
and by violence.</p>

the last time I implore you to leave me; already do I feel

meanness of this world are forgotten beneath the Divine

then, sire, and for the last time, I again implore you to leave
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Confess, rather," cried
Louis, "that you have never loved me; admit that my humility and
my repentance are flattering to your pride, but that my distress
affects you not; that the king of this wide realm is no longer
regarded as a lover whose tenderness of devotion is capable of
working out your happiness, but as a despot whose caprice has
crushed your very heart beneath his iron heel.<span style=

say rather you are fleeing from the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

made the fever of hope course once more through her every

sister?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

leaving the room, she tore herself from the king's grasp, and
returned to the stone crucifix, which she kissed, saying, "Oh,
Heaven! it was thou who drewest me hither! thou, who has rejected
me; but thy grace is infinite.<span style=

F</span>rom the manner in which the king had dismissed the
ambassadors, even the least clear-sighted persons belonging to
the court imagined war would ensue.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The ambassadors themselves, but
slightly acquainted with the king's domestic disturbances, had
interpreted as directed against themselves the celebrated
sentence: &ldquo;If I be not master of myself, I, at least, will
be so of those who insult me.&rdquo;<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Happily for the destinies of France
and Holland, Colbert had followed them out of the king's presence
for the purpose of explaining matters to them; but the two queens
and Madame, who were perfectly aware of every particular that had
taken place in their several households, having heard the king's
remark, so full of dark meaning, retired to their own apartments
in no little fear and chagrin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame, especially, felt that the
royal anger might fall upon her, and, as she was brave and
exceedingly proud, instead of seeking support and encouragement
from the queen-mother, she had returned to her own apartments, if
not without some uneasiness, at least without any intention of
avoiding an encounter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Anne of Austria, from time to time at frequent intervals, sent
messages to learn if the king had returned.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The silence which the whole palace
preserved upon the matter, and upon Louise's disappearance, was
indicative of a long train of misfortunes to all those who knew
the haughty and irritable humor of the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Madame, unmoved in spite of all
the flying rumors, shut herself up in her apartments, sent for
Montalais, and, with a voice as calm as she could possibly
command, desired her to relate all she knew about the event
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the moment
that the eloquent Montalais was concluding, with all kinds of
oratorical precautions, and was recommending, if not in actual
language, at least in spirit, that she should show forbearance
towards La Valli&egrave;re, M. Malicorne made his appearance to
beg an audience of Madame, on behalf of the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais's worthy friend bore upon
his countenance all the signs of the very liveliest emotion.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was impossible to be
mistaken; the interview which the king requested would be one of
the most interesting chapters in the history of the hearts of
kings and of men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame
was disturbed by her brother-in-law's arrival; she did not expect
it so soon, nor had she, indeed, expected any direct step on
Louis's part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides,
all women who wage war successfully by indirect means, are
invariably neither very skillful nor very strong when it becomes
a question of accepting a pitched battle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame, however, was not one who
ever drew back; she had the very opposite defect or
qualification, in whichever light it may be considered; she took
an exaggerated view of what constituted real courage; and
therefore the king's message, of which Malicorne had been the
bearer, was regarded by her as the bugle-note proclaiming the
commencement of hostilities.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She, therefore, boldly accepted the
gage of battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Five
minutes afterwards the king ascended the staircase.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His color was heightened from having
ridden hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His dusty
and disordered clothes formed a singular contrast with the fresh
and perfectly arranged toilette of Madame, who, notwithstanding
the rouge on her cheeks, turned pale as Louis entered the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis lost no time
in approaching the object of his visit; he sat down, and
Montalais disappeared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear sister," said
the king, "you are aware that Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re
fled from her own room this morning, and that she has retired to
a cloister, overwhelmed by grief and despair."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As he pronounced these words, the
king's voice was singularly moved.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty is the
first to inform me of it," replied Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

that you might have learned it this morning, during the reception
of the ambassadors," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire, I imagined that something extraordinary had happened, but
without knowing what."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king, with his usual
frankness, went straight to the point.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Why did you send Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re away?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because I had reason to
be dissatisfied with her conduct," she replied, dryly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king became crimson,
and his eyes kindled with a fire which it required all Madame's
courage to support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
mastered his anger, however, and continued: "A stronger reason
than that is surely requisite, for one so good and kind as you
are, to turn away and dishonor, not only the young girl herself,
but every member of her family as well.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know that the whole city has its
eyes fixed upon the conduct of the female portion of the
court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To dismiss a maid
of honor is to attribute a crime to her - at the very least a
fault.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What crime, what
fault has Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re been guilty of?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Since you constitute
yourself the protector of Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re,"
replied Madame, coldly, "I will give you those explanations which
I should have a perfect right to withhold from every one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Even from the king!"
exclaimed Louis, as, with a sudden gesture, he covered his head
with his hat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have called me your
sister," said Madame, "and I am in my own apartments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It matters not," said
the youthful monarch, ashamed at having been hurried away by his
anger; "neither you, nor any one else in this kingdom, can assert
a right to withhold an explanation in my presence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Since that is the way
you regard it," said Madame, in a hoarse, angry tone of voice,
"all that remains for me to do is bow submission to your majesty,
and to be silent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not so.<span style=

us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

repeat; you are perfectly aware that, as the head of the nobility

"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame shrugged her
shoulders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Or whoever
else it may be, I repeat," continued the king; "and as, acting in
that manner, you cast a dishonorable reflection upon that person,
I ask you for an explanation, in order that I may confirm or
annul the sentence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Annul my sentence!"
exclaimed Madame, haughtily.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What! when I have discharged one of
my attendants, do you order me to take her back again?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king remained silent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

abuse of power, sire; it would be indecorous and unseemly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As a woman, I should
revolt against an abuse so insulting to me; I should no longer be
able to regard myself as a princess of your blood, a daughter of
a monarch; I should be the meanest of creatures, more humbled and
disgraced than the servant I had sent away."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

seat with anger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It
cannot be a heart," he cried, "you have beating in your bosom; if
you act in such a way with me, I may have reason to act with
corresponding severity."</p>

have reason to dread reprisals.<span style=

indignant at the mere sound of her name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

M</span>adame was not bad-hearted - she was only hasty and
impetuous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king was
not imprudent - he was simply in love.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hardly had they entered into this
compact, which terminated in La Valli&egrave;re's recall, when
they both sought to make as much as they could by their
bargain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king wished
to see La Valli&egrave;re every moment of the day, while Madame,
who was sensible of the king's annoyance ever since he had so
entreated her, would not relinquish her revenge on La
Valli&egrave;re without a contest.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She planted every conceivable
difficulty in the king's path; he was, in fact, obliged, in order
to get a glimpse of La Valli&egrave;re, to be exceedingly devoted
in his attentions to his sister-in-law, and this, indeed, was
Madame's plan of policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
As she had chosen some one to second her efforts, and as this
person was our old friend Montalais, the king found himself
completely hemmed in every time he paid Madame a visit; he was
surrounded, and was never left a moment alone.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame displayed in her conversation
a charm of manner and brilliancy of wit which dazzled
everybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais
followed her, and soon rendered herself perfectly insupportable
to the king, which was, in fact, the very thing she expected
would happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She then
set Malicorne at the king, who found means of informing his
majesty that there was a young person belonging to the court who
was exceedingly miserable; and on the king inquiring who this
person was, Malicorne replied that it was Mademoiselle de
Montalais.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To this the
king answered that it was perfectly just that a person should be
unhappy when she rendered others so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whereupon Malicorne explained how
matters stood; for he had received his directions from
Montalais.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king began
to open his eyes; he remarked that, as soon as he made his
appearance, Madame made hers too; that she remained in the
corridors until after he had left; that she accompanied him back
to his own apartments, fearing that he might speak in the
ante-chambers to one of her maids of honor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One evening she went further
still.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king was
seated, surrounded by the ladies who were present, and holding in
his hand, concealed by his lace ruffle, a small note which he
wished to slip into La Valli&egrave;re's hand.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame guessed both his intention
and the letter too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
was difficult to prevent the king going wherever he pleased, and
yet it was necessary to prevent his going near La
Valli&egrave;re, or speaking to her, as by so doing he could let
the note fall into her lap behind her fan, or into her
pocket-handkerchief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king, who was also on the watch, suspected that a snare was being
laid for him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He rose and
pushed his chair, without affectation, near Mademoiselle de
Ch&acirc;tillon, with whom he began to talk in a light tone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were amusing themselves
making rhymes; from Mademoiselle de Ch&acirc;tillon he went to
Montalais, and then to Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And thus, by this skillful
maneuver, he found himself seated opposite to La Valli&egrave;re,
whom he completely concealed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame pretended to be greatly
occupied, altering a group of flowers that she was working in
tapestry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king showed
the corner of his letter to La Valli&egrave;re, and the latter
held out her handkerchief with a look that signified, "Put the
letter inside."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, as
the king had placed his own handkerchief upon his chair, he was
adroit enough to let it fall on the ground, so that La
Valli&egrave;re slipped her handkerchief on the chair.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king took it up quietly,
without any one observing what he did, placed the letter within
it, and returned the handkerchief to the place he had taken it
from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was only just
time for La Valli&egrave;re to stretch out her hand to take hold
of the handkerchief with its valuable contents.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But Madame, who had
observed everything that had passed, said to Mademoiselle de
Ch&acirc;tillon, "Ch&acirc;tillon, be good enough to pick up the
king's handkerchief, if you please; it has fallen on the
carpet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young girl obeyed
with the utmost precipitation, the king having moved from his
seat, and La Valli&egrave;re being in no little degree nervous
and confused.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I beg your majesty's pardon," said
Mademoiselle de Ch&acirc;tillon; "you have two handkerchiefs, I
perceive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And the king was
accordingly obliged to put into his pocket La Valli&egrave;re's
handkerchief as well as his own.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He certainly gained that souvenir of
Louise, who lost, however, a copy of verses which had cost the
king ten hours' hard labor, and which, as far as he was
concerned, was perhaps as good as a long poem.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It would be impossible to describe
the king's anger and La Valli&egrave;re's despair; but shortly
afterwards a circumstance occurred which was more than
remarkable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the king
left, in order to retire to his own apartments, Malicorne,
informed of what had passed, one can hardly tell how, was waiting
in the ante-chamber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
ante-chambers of the Palais Royal are naturally very dark, and,
in the evening, they were but indifferently lighted.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing pleased the king more than
this dim light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As a
general rule, love, whose mind and heart are constantly in a
blaze, contemns all light, except the sunshine of the soul.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so the ante-chamber was
dark; a page carried a torch before the king, who walked on
slowly, greatly annoyed at what had recently occurred.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne passed close to the
king, almost stumbled against him in fact, and begged his
forgiveness with the profoundest humility; but the king, who was
in an exceedingly ill-temper, was very sharp in his reproof to
Malicorne, who disappeared as soon and as quietly as he possibly
could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis retired to
rest, having had a misunderstanding with the queen; and the next
day, as soon as he entered the cabinet, he wished to have La
Valli&egrave;re's handkerchief in order to press his lips to
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He called his
valet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Fetch me," he said,
"the coat I wore yesterday evening, but be very sure you do not
touch anything it may contain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The order being obeyed,
the king himself searched the pocket of the coat; he found only
one handkerchief, and that his own; La Valli&egrave;re's had
disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whilst
busied with all kinds of conjectures and suspicions, a letter was
brought to him from La Valli&egrave;re; it ran thus:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How good and kind of
you to have sent me those beautiful verses; how full of ingenuity
and perseverance your affection is; how is it possible to help
loving you so dearly!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What does this mean?"
thought the king; "there must be some mistake.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Look well about," said he to the
valet, "for a pocket-handkerchief must be in one of my pockets;
and if you do not find it, or if you have touched it - "<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He reflected for a
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To make a state
matter of the loss of the handkerchief would be to act absurdly,
and he therefore added, "There was a letter of some importance
inside the handkerchief, which had somehow got among the folds of
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire," said the valet,
"your majesty had only one handkerchief, and that is it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True, true," replied
the king, setting his teeth hard together.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh, poverty, how I envy you!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Happy is the man who can empty
his own pockets of letters and handkerchiefs!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He read La
Valli&egrave;re's letter over again, endeavoring to imagine in
what conceivable way his verses could have reached their
destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was a
postscript to the letter:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I send you back by your
messenger this reply, so unworthy of what you sent me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So far so good; I shall
find out something now," he said delightedly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Who is waiting, and who brought me
this letter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. Malicorne," replied
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valet de chambre</i>,
timidly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Desire him to come
in."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Malicorne entered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You come from
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re?" said the king, with a
sigh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you took
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re something from me?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle de la

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

de la Valli&egrave;re is mistaken."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king frowned.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What jest is this?" he said;
"explain yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why
does Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re call you my
messenger?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What did you
take to that lady?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Speak,
monsieur, and quickly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I merely took
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re a pocket-handkerchief, that
was all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A handkerchief, - what
handkerchief?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, at the very
moment when I had the misfortune to stumble against your majesty
yesterday - a misfortune which I shall deplore to the last day of
my life, especially after the dissatisfaction which you exhibited
- I remained, sire, motionless with despair, your majesty being
at too great a distance to hear my excuses, when I saw something
white lying on the ground."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I stooped down, - it
was a pocket-handkerchief.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For a moment I had an idea that when
I stumbled against your majesty I must have been the cause of the
handkerchief falling from your pocket; but as I felt it all over
very respectfully, I perceived a cipher at one of the corners,
and, on looking at it closely, I found that it was Mademoiselle
de la Valli&egrave;re's cipher.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I presumed that on her way to
Madame's apartment in the earlier part of the evening she had let
her handkerchief fall, and I accordingly hastened to restore it
to her as she was leaving; and that is all I gave to Mademoiselle
de la Valli&egrave;re, I entreat your majesty to believe."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne's manner was so
simple, so full of contrition, and marked with such extreme
humility, that the king was greatly amused in listening to
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was as pleased
with him for what he had done as if he had rendered him the
greatest service.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is the second
fortunate meeting I have had with you, monsieur," he said; "you
may count upon my good intentions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The plain and sober
truth was, that Malicorne had picked the king's pocket of the
handkerchief as dexterously as any of the pickpockets of the good
city of Paris could have done.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame never knew of this little
incident, but Montalais gave La Valli&egrave;re some idea of the
manner in which it had really happened, and La Valli&egrave;re
afterwards told the king, who laughed exceedingly at it and
pronounced Malicorne to be a first rate politician.<span style=

M</span>iracles, unfortunately, could not be always happening,
whilst Madame's ill-humor still continued.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In a week's time, matters had
reached such a point, that the king could no longer look at La
Valli&egrave;re without a look full of suspicion crossing his
own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whenever a promenade
was proposed, Madame, in order to avoid the recurrence of similar
scenes to that of the thunder-storm, or the royal oak, had a
variety of indispositions ready prepared; and, thanks to them,
she was unable to go out, and her maids of honor were obliged to
remain indoors also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
There was not the slightest chance of means of paying a nocturnal
visit; for in this respect the king had, on the very first
occasion, experienced a severe check, which happened in the
following manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As at
Fontainebleau, he had taken Saint-Aignan with him one evening
when he wished to pay La Valli&egrave;re a visit; but he had
found no one but Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, who had begun
to call out "Fire!" and "Thieves!" in such a manner that a
perfect legion of chamber-maids, attendants, and pages, ran to
her assistance; so that Saint-Aignan, who had remained behind in
order to save the honor of his royal master, who had fled
precipitately, was obliged to submit to a severe scolding from
the queen-mother, as well as from Madame herself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In addition, he had, the next
morning, received two challenges from the De Mortemart family,
and the king had been obliged to interfere.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This mistake had been owing to the
circumstance of Madame having suddenly ordered a change in the
apartments of her maids of honor, and directed La Valli&egrave;re
and Montalais to sleep in her own cabinet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No gateway, therefore, was any
longer open - not even communication by letter; to write under
the eyes of so ferocious an Argus as Madame, whose temper and
disposition were so uncertain, was to run the risk of exposure to
the greatest danger; and it can well be conceived into what a
state of continuous irritation, and ever increasing anger, all
these petty annoyances threw the young lion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king almost tormented himself to
death endeavoring to discover a means of communication; and, as
he did not think proper to call in the aid of Malicorne or
D'Artagnan, the means were not discovered at all.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne had, indeed, occasional
brilliant flashes of imagination, with which he tried to inspire
the king with confidence; but, whether from shame or suspicion,
the king, who had at first begun to nibble at the bait, soon
abandoned the hook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
this way, for instance, one evening, while the king was crossing
the garden, and looking up at Madame's windows, Malicorne
stumbled over a ladder lying beside a border of box, and said to
Manicamp, then walking with him behind the king, "Did you not see
that I just now stumbled against a ladder, and was nearly thrown
down?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," said Manicamp, as
usual very absent-minded, "but it appears you did not fall."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That doesn't matter;
but it is not on that account the less dangerous to leave ladders
lying about in that manner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True, one might hurt
one's self, especially when troubled with fits of absence of
mind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I don't mean that; what
I did mean, was that it is dangerous to allow ladders to lie
about so near the windows of the maids of honor."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis started imperceptibly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so?" inquired
Manicamp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak louder,"
whispered Malicorne, as he touched him with his arm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so?" said Manicamp,
louder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king
listened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because, for instance,"
said Malicorne, "a ladder nineteen feet high is just the height
of the cornice of those windows."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Manicamp, instead of answering, was
dreaming of something else.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ask me, can't you, what
windows I mean," whispered Malicorne.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But what windows are
you referring to?" said Manicamp, aloud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The windows of Madame's
apartments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I don't say that any one would ever
venture to go up a ladder into Madame's room; but in Madame's
cabinet, merely separated by a partition, sleep two exceedingly
pretty girls, Mesdemoiselles de la Valli&egrave;re and de
Montalais."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "By a partition?" said
Manicamp.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Look; you see how
brilliantly lighted Madame's apartments are - well, do you see
those two windows?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And that window close
to the others, but more dimly lighted?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, that is the room
of the maids of honor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Look, there is Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re opening the
window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! how many soft
things could an enterprising lover say to her, if he only
suspected that there was lying here a ladder nineteen feet long,
which would just reach the cornice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But she is not alone;
you said Mademoiselle de Montalais is with her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle de
Montalais counts for nothing; she is her oldest friend, and
exceedingly devoted to her - a positive well, into which can be
thrown all sorts of secrets one might wish to get rid of."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king did not lose a
single syllable of this conversation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne even remarked that his
majesty slackened his pace, in order to give him time to
finish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So, when they
arrived at the door, Louis dismissed every one, with the
exception of Malicorne - a circumstance which excited no
surprise, for it was known that the king was in love; and they
suspected he was going to compose some verses by moonlight; and,
although there was no moon that evening, the king might,
nevertheless, have some verses to compose.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every one, therefore, took his
leave; and, immediately afterwards, the king turned towards
Malicorne, who respectfully waited until his majesty should
address him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What were
you saying, just now, about a ladder, Monsieur Malicorne?" he
asked.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did I say anything
about ladders, sire?" said Malicorne, looking up, as if in search
of words which had flown away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, of a ladder
nineteen feet long."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, yes, sire, I
remember; but I spoke to M. Manicamp, and I should not have said
a word had I known your majesty was near enough to hear us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And why would you not
have said a word?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because I should not
have liked to get the gardener into a scrape who left it there -
poor fellow!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Don't make yourself
uneasy on that account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
What is this ladder like?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If your majesty wishes
to see it, nothing is easier, for there it is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that box hedge?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span>
"Exactly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Show it to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Malicorne turned back,
and led the king up to the ladder, saying, "This is it,
sire."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pull it
this way a little."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> When
Malicorne had brought the ladder on to the gravel walk, the king
began to step its whole length.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Hum!" he said; "you say it is
nineteen feet long?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nineteen feet - that is
rather long; I hardly believe it can be so long as that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You cannot judge very
correctly with the ladder in that position, sire.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If it were upright, against a tree
or a wall, for instance, you would be better able to judge,
because the comparison would assist you a good deal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! it does not matter,
M. Malicorne; but I can hardly believe that the ladder is
nineteen feet high."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know how accurate
your majesty's glance is, and yet I would wager."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king shook his
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "There is one
unanswerable means of verifying it," said Malicorne.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Every one knows, sire,
that the ground-floor of the palace is eighteen feet high."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True, that is very well
known."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, sire, if I place
the ladder against the wall, we shall be able to ascertain."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "True."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Malicorne took up the
ladder, like a feather, and placed it upright against the
wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, in order to
try the experiment, he chose, or chance, perhaps, directed him to
choose, the very window of the cabinet where La Valli&egrave;re
was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The ladder just
reached the edge of the cornice, that is to say, the sill of the
window; so that, by standing upon the last round but one of the
ladder, a man of about the middle height, as the king was, for
instance, could easily talk with those who might be in the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hardly had the
ladder been properly placed, when the king, dropping the assumed
part he had been playing in the comedy, began to ascend the
rounds of the ladder, which Malicorne held at the bottom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But hardly had he completed
half the distance when a patrol of Swiss guards appeared in the
garden, and advanced straight towards them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king descended with the utmost
precipitation, and concealed himself among the trees.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne at once perceived that he
must offer himself as a sacrifice; for if he, too, were to
conceal himself, the guard would search everywhere until they had
found either himself or the king, perhaps both.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It would be far better, therefore,
that he alone should be discovered.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, consequently, Malicorne hid
himself so clumsily that he was the only one arrested.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as he was arrested,
Malicorne was taken to the guard-house, and there he declared who
he was, and was immediately recognized.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime, by concealing
himself first behind one clump of trees and then behind another,
the king reached the side door of his apartment, very much
humiliated, and still more disappointed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> More than that, the noise made in
arresting Malicorne had drawn La Valli&egrave;re and Montalais to
their window; and even Madame herself had appeared at her own,
with a pair of wax candles, one in each hand, clamorously asking
what was the matter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In the meantime,
Malicorne sent for D'Artagnan, who did not lose a moment in
hurrying to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it
was in vain he attempted to make him understand his reasons, and
in vain also that D'Artagnan did understand them; and, further,
it was equally in vain that both their sharp and intuitive minds
endeavored to give another turn to the adventure; there was no
other resource left for Malicorne but to let it be supposed that
he had wished to enter Mademoiselle de Montalais's apartment, as
Saint-Aignan had passed for having wished to force Mademoiselle
de Tonnay-Charente's door.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame was inflexible; in the first
place, because, if Malicorne had, in fact, wished to enter her
apartment at night through the window, and by means of the
ladder, in order to see Montalais, it was a punishable offense on
Malicorne's part, and he must be punished accordingly; and, in
the second place, if Malicorne, instead of acting in his own
name, had acted as an intermediary between La Valli&egrave;re and
a person whose name it was superfluous to mention, his crime was
in that case even greater, since love, which is an excuse for
everything, did not exist in the case as an excuse.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame therefore made the greatest
possible disturbance about the matter, and obtained his dismissal
from Monsieur's household, without reflecting, poor blind
creature, that both Malicorne and Montalais held her fast in
their clutches in consequence of her visit to De Guiche, and in a
variety of other ways equally delicate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais, who was perfectly
furious, wished to revenge herself immediately, but Malicorne
pointed out to her that the king's countenance would repay them
for all the disgraces in the world, and that it was a great thing
to have to suffer on his majesty's account.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Malicorne was perfectly
right, and, therefore, although Montalais had the spirit of ten
women in her, he succeeded in bringing her round to his own
opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And we must not
omit to state that the king helped them to console themselves,
for, in the first place, he presented Malicorne with fifty
thousand francs as a compensation for the post he had lost, and,
in the next place, he gave him an appointment in his own
household, delighted to have an opportunity of revenging himself
in such a manner upon Madame for all she had made him and La
Valli&egrave;re suffer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But as Malicorne could no longer carry significant handkerchiefs
for him or plant convenient ladders, the royal lover was in a
terrible state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There
seemed to be no hope, therefore, of ever getting near La
Valli&egrave;re again, so long as she should remain at the Palais
Royal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All the dignities
and all the money in the world could not remedy that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fortunately, however, Malicorne was
on the lookout, and this so successfully that he met Montalais,
who, to do her justice, it must be admitted, was doing her best
to meet Malicorne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What
do you do during the night in Madame's apartment?" he asked the
young girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, I go to sleep, of
course," she replied.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But it is very wrong to
sleep; it can hardly be possible that, with the pain you are
suffering, you can manage to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what am I suffering
from, may I ask?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you not in despair
at my absence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of course not, since
you have received fifty thousand francs and an appointment in the
king's household."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is a matter of no
moment; you are exceedingly afflicted at not seeing me as you
used to see me formerly, and more than all, you are in despair at
my having lost Madame's confidence; come now, is not that
true?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Perfectly true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good; your
distress of mind prevents you sleeping at night, and so you sob,
and sigh, and blow your nose ten times every minute as loud as
possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, my dear Malicorne,
Madame cannot endure the slightest noise near her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know that perfectly
well; of course she can't endure anything; and so, I tell you,
when she hears your deep distress, she will turn you out of her
rooms without a moment's delay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I understand."</p>

happen next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The next thing that
will happen will be, that La Valli&egrave;re, finding herself
alone without you, will groan and utter such loud lamentations,
that she will exhibit despair enough for two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case she will
be put into <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>another</i>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, but which?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Which?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, that will puzzle
you to say, Mr. Inventor-General."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

T</span>he advice which had been given to Montalais was
communicated by her to La Valli&egrave;re, who could not but
acknowledge that it was by no means deficient in judgment, and
who, after a certain amount of resistance, rising rather from
timidity than indifference to the project, resolved to put it
into execution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
story of the two girls weeping, and filling Madame's bedroom with
the noisiest lamentations, was Malicorne's <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As nothing is so probable as
improbability, so natural as romance, this kind of Arabian Nights
story succeeded perfectly with Madame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first thing she did was to send
Montalais away, and then, three days, or rather three nights
afterwards, she had La Valli&egrave;re removed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She gave the latter one of the small
rooms on the top story, situated immediately over the apartments
allotted to the gentlemen of Monsieur's suite.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One story only, that is to say, a
mere flooring separated the maids of honor from the officers and
gentlemen of her husband's household.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A private staircase, which was
placed under Madame de Navailles's surveillance, was the only
means of communication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
For greater safety, Madame de Navailles, who had heard of his
majesty's previous attempts, had the windows of the rooms and the
openings of the chimneys carefully barred.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was, therefore, every possible
security provided for Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re, whose
room now bore more resemblance to a cage than to anything
else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When Mademoiselle
de la Valli&egrave;re was in her own room, and she was there very
frequently, for Madame scarcely ever had any occasion for her
services, since she once knew she was safe under Madame de
Navailles's inspection, Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re had no
better means of amusing herself than looking through the bars of
her windows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It happened,
therefore, that one morning, as she was looking out as usual, she
perceived Malicorne at one of the windows exactly opposite to her
own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He held a
carpenter's rule in his hand, was surveying the buildings, and
seemed to be adding up some figures on paper.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re recognized
Malicorne and nodded to him; Malicorne, in his turn, replied by a
formal bow, and disappeared from the window.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was surprised at this marked
coolness, so different from his usual unfailing good-humor, but
she remembered that he had lost his appointment on her account,
and that he could hardly be very amiably disposed towards her,
since, in all probability, she would never be in a position to
make him any recompense for what he had lost.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She knew how to forgive offenses,
and with still more readiness could she sympathize with
misfortune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La
Valli&egrave;re would have asked Montalais her opinion, if she
had been within hearing, but she was absent, it being the hour
she commonly devoted to her own correspondence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suddenly La Valli&egrave;re observed
something thrown from the window where Malicorne had been
standing, pass across the open space which separated the iron
bars, and roll upon the floor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She advanced with no little
curiosity towards this object, and picked it up; it was a wooden
reel for silk, only, in this instance, instead of silk, a piece
of paper was rolled round it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re unrolled it and

exceedingly anxious to learn two things: the first is, to know if
the flooring of your apartment is wood or brick; the second, to
ascertain at what distance your bed is placed from the
window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Forgive my
importunity, and will you be good enough to send me an answer by
the same way you receive this letter - that is to say, by means
of the silk winder; only, instead of throwing into my room, as I
have thrown it into yours, which will be too difficult for you to
attempt, have the goodness merely to let it fall.<span style=

humble, most respectful servant,</p>

"MALICORNE.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

please, upon the letter itself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! poor fellow,"
exclaimed La Valli&egrave;re, "he must have gone out of his
mind;" and she directed towards her correspondent - of whom she
caught but a faint glimpse, in consequence of the darkness of the
room - a look full of compassionate consideration.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne understood her, and shook
his head, as if he meant to say, "No, no, I am not out of my
mind; be quite satisfied."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She smiled, as if still
in doubt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no," he signified
by a gesture, "my head is right," and pointed to his head, then,
after moving his hand like a man who writes very rapidly, he put
his hands together as if entreating her to write.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re, even
if he were mad, saw no impropriety in doing what Malicorne
requested her; she took a pencil and wrote "Wood," and then
walked slowly from her window to her bed, and wrote, "Six paces,"
and having done this, she looked out again at Malicorne, who
bowed to her, signifying that he was about to descend.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re understood
that it was to pick up the silk winder.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She approached the window, and, in
accordance with Malicorne's instructions, let it fall.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The winder was still rolling
along the flag-stones as Malicorne started after it, overtook and
picked it up, and beginning to peel it as a monkey would do with
a nut, he ran straight towards M. de Saint-Aignan's
apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan
had chosen, or rather solicited, that his rooms might be as near
the king as possible, as certain plants seek the sun's rays in
order to develop themselves more luxuriantly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His apartment consisted of two
rooms, in that portion of the palace occupied by Louis XIV.
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de
Saint-Aignan was very proud of this proximity, which afforded
easy access to his majesty, and, more than that, the favor of
occasional unexpected meetings.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the moment we are now referring
to, he was engaged in having both his rooms magnificently
carpeted, with expectation of receiving the honor of frequent
visits from the king; for his majesty, since his passion for La
Valli&egrave;re, had chosen Saint-Aignan as his confidant, and
could not, in fact, do without him, either night or day.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne introduced himself
to the comte, and met with no difficulties, because he had been
favorably noticed by the king; and also, because the credit which
one man may happen to enjoy is always a bait for others.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan asked his visitor
if he brought any news with him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; great news,"
replied the latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! ah!" said
Saint-Aignan, "what is it?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span>
"Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re has changed her
quarters."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you mean?" said
Saint-Aignan, opening his eyes very wide.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "She was living in the same
apartments as Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely so; but
Madame got tired of her proximity, and has installed her in a
room which is situated exactly above your future apartment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! up there,"
exclaimed Saint-Aignan, with surprise, and pointing at the floor
above him with his finger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," said Malicorne,
"yonder," indicating the building opposite.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you mean, then,
by saying that her room is above my apartment?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because I am sure that
your apartment <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ought</i>,
providentially, to be under Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re's
room."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Saint-Aignan, at this
remark, gave poor Malicorne a look, similar to one of those La
Valli&egrave;re had already given a quarter of an hour before,
that is to say, he thought he had lost his senses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," said
Malicorne to him, "I wish to answer what you are thinking
about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you mean by
'what I am thinking about'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My reason is, that you
have not clearly understood what I want to convey."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I admit it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, you are
aware that underneath the apartments set for Madame's maids of
honor, the gentlemen in attendance on the king and on Monsieur
are lodged."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I know that, since
Manicamp, De Wardes, and others are living there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, monsieur, admire the
singularity of the circumstance; the two rooms destined for M. de
Guiche are exactly the very two rooms situated underneath those
which Mademoiselle de Montalais and Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re occupy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well; what then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "'What then,' do you
say?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why, these two rooms
are empty, since M. de Guiche is now lying wounded at
Fontainebleau."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I assure you, my dear
fellow, I cannot grasp your meaning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! if I had the
happiness to call myself Saint-Aignan, I should guess
immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what would you do
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should at once change
the rooms I am occupying here, for those which M. de Guiche is
not using yonder."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Can you suppose such a
thing?" said Saint-Aignan, disdainfully.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What! abandon the chief post of
honor, the proximity to the king, a privilege conceded only to
princes of the blood, to dukes, and peers!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Permit me to tell you, my dear
Monsieur de Malicorne, that you must be out of your senses."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur," replied the
young man, seriously, "you commit two mistakes.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My name is Malicorne, simply; and I
am in perfect possession of all my senses."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, drawing a paper from his
pocket, he said, "Listen to what I am going to say; and
afterwards, I will show you this paper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am listening," said
Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know that Madame
looks after La Valli&egrave;re as carefully as Argus did after
the nymph Io."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know that the king
has sought for an opportunity, but uselessly, of speaking to the
prisoner, and that neither you nor myself have yet succeeded in
procuring him this piece of good fortune."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You certainly ought to
know something about the subject, my poor Malicorne," said
Saint-Aignan, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good; what do you
suppose would happen to the man whose imagination devised some
means of bringing the lovers together?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! the
king would set no bounds to his gratitude."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let me ask you, then,
M. de Saint-Aignan, whether you would not be curious to taste a
little of this royal gratitude?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Certainly," replied
Saint-Aignan, "any favor of my master, as a recognition of the
proper discharge of my duty, would assuredly be most
precious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, look at
this paper, monsieur le comte."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is it - a
plan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; a plan of M. de
Guiche's two rooms, which, in all probability, will soon be your
two rooms."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! no, whatever may
happen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because my rooms are
the envy of too many gentlemen, to whom I certainly shall not
give them up; M. de Roquelaure, for instance, M. de la
Fert&eacute;, and M. de Dangeau, would all be anxious to get
them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case I shall
leave you, monsieur le comte, and I shall go and offer to one of
those gentlemen the plan I have just shown you, together with the
advantages annexed to it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But why do you not keep
them for yourself?" inquired Saint-Aignan, suspiciously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>           </span></span> "Because the king
would never do me the honor of paying me a visit openly, whilst
he would readily go and see any one of those gentlemen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! the king would go
and see any one of those gentlemen?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Go! most certainly he
would ten times instead of once.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it possible you can ask me if the
king would go to an apartment which would bring him nearer to
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, indeed,
delightfully near her, with a floor between them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Malicorne unfolded the
piece of paper which had been wrapped round the bobbin.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur le comte," he said,
"have the goodness to observe that the flooring of Mademoiselle
de la Valli&egrave;re's room is merely a wooden flooring."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! all you would
have to do would be to get hold of a journeyman carpenter, lock
him up in your apartments, without letting him know where you
have taken him to, and let him make a hole in your ceiling, and
consequently in the flooring of Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re's room."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good heavens!"
exclaimed Saint-Aignan, as if dazzled.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is the matter?"
said Malicorne.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing, except that
you have hit upon a singular, bold idea, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It will seem a very
trifling one to the king, I assure you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Lovers never think of
the risk they run."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What danger do you
apprehend, monsieur le comte?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, effecting such an
opening as that will make a terrible noise: it could be heard all
over the palace."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! monsieur le comte,
I am quite sure that the carpenter I shall select will not make
the slightest noise in the world.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He will saw an opening three feet
square, with a saw covered with tow, and no one, not even those
adjoining, will know that he is at work."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear Monsieur
Malicorne, you astound, you positively bewilder me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To continue," replied
Malicorne, quietly, "in the room, the ceiling of which you will
have cut through, you will put up a staircase, which will either
allow Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re to descend into your
room, or the king to ascend into Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re's room."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the staircase will
be seen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; for in your room it
will be hidden by a partition, over which you will throw a
tapestry similar to that which covers the rest of the apartment;
and in Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re's room it will not be
seen, for the trapdoor, which will be a part of the flooring
itself, will be made to open under the bed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of course," said
Saint-Aignan, whose eyes began to sparkle with delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And now, monsieur le
comte, there is no occasion to make you admit that the king will
frequently come to the room where such a staircase is
constructed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I think that
M. Dangeau, particularly, will be struck by my idea, and I shall
now go and explain to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, my dear Monsieur
Malicorne, you forget that you spoke to me about it the first,
and that I have consequently the right of priority."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you wish for the
preference?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do I wish it?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of course I do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The fact is, Monsieur
de Saint-Aignan, I am presenting you with a Jacob's ladder, which
is better than the promise of an additional step in the peerage -
perhaps, even with a good estate to accompany your dukedom."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At least," replied
Saint-Aignan, "it will give me an opportunity of showing the king
that he is not mistaken in occasionally calling me his friend; an
opportunity, dear M. Malicorne, for which I am indebted to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And which you will not
forget to remember?" inquired Malicorne, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing will delight me
more, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But I am not the king's
friend; I am simply his attendant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; and if you imagine
that that staircase is as good as a dukedom for myself, I think
there will certainly be letters of nobility at the top of it for
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Malicorne bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not
think the king will object to it.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the carpenter I was speaking of."</p>

hour after Saint-Aignan's new resolution, he was in possession of
the two rooms; and ten minutes later Malicorne entered, followed
by the upholsterers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
During this time, the king asked for Saint-Aignan; the valet ran
to his late apartments and found M. Dangeau there; Dangeau sent
him on to De Guiche's, and Saint-Aignan was found there; but a
little delay had of course taken place, and the king had already
exhibited once or twice evident signs of impatience, when
Saint-Aignan entered his royal master's presence, quite out of
breath.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You, too, abandon me,
then," said Louis XIV., in a similar tone of lamentation to that

said you were abandoning me?" exclaimed the king.<span style=

there was only one woman for whom my heart cared at all, and all
my family is leagued together to tear her from me; and my friend,
to whom I confided my distress, and who helped me to bear up
under it, has become wearied of my complaints and is going to
leave me without even asking my permission."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

laugh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king at once

full of hope.</p>

Saint-Aignan, a true friend's idea, a poet's idea.<span style=

out this evening at eight o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

upon the exact minute."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

tell me nothing more?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

nothing more to tell you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Industry counts for something in this world, sire; but still,
chance plays so important a part in it that I have been
accustomed to leave her the sidewalk, confident that she will
manage so as to always take the street."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I abandon myself
entirely to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you are quite
right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Comforted in this
manner, the king went immediately to Madame, to whom he announced
the intended expedition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Madame fancied at the first moment that she saw in this
unexpectedly arranged party a plot of the king's to converse with
La Valli&egrave;re, either on the road under cover of the
darkness, or in some other way, but she took especial care not to
show any of her fancies to her brother-in-law, and accepted the
invitation with a smile upon her lips.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She gave directions aloud that her
maids of honor should accompany her, secretly intending in the
evening to take the most effectual steps to interfere with his
majesty's attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Then, when she was alone, and at the very moment the poor lover,
who had issued orders for the departure, was reveling in the idea
that Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re would form one of the
party, - luxuriating in the sad happiness persecuted lovers enjoy
of realizing through the sense of sight alone all the transports
of possession, - Madame, who was surrounded by her maids of
honor, was saying: - "Two ladies will be enough for me this
evening, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente and Mademoiselle de
Montalais."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re had
anticipated her own omission, and was prepared for it: but
persecution had rendered her courageous, and she did not give
Madame the pleasure of seeing on her face the impression of the
shock her heart received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
On the contrary, smiling with that ineffable gentleness which
gave an angelic expression to her features - "In that case,
Madame, I shall be at liberty this evening, I suppose?" she
said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of course."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I shall be able to
employ it, then, in progressing with that piece of tapestry which
your highness has been good enough to notice, and which I have
already had the honor of offering to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And having made a
respectful obeisance she withdrew to her own apartment;
Mesdemoiselles de Tonnay-Charente and de Montalais did the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The rumor of the
intended promenade soon spread all over the palace; ten minutes
afterwards Malicorne learned Madame's resolution, and slipped
under Montalais's door a note, in the following terms:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "L. V. must positively
pass the night the night with Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais, in pursuance
of the compact she had entered into, began by burning the letter,
and then sat down to reflect.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais was a girl full of
expedients, and so she very soon arranged her plan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Towards five o'clock, which was the
hour for her to repair to Madame's apartment, she was running
across the courtyard, and had reached within a dozen paces of a
group of officers, when she uttered a cry, fell gracefully on one
knee, rose again, with difficulty, and walked on limpingly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The gentlemen ran forward to
her assistance; Montalais had sprained her foot.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Faithful to the discharge of her
duty, she insisted, however, notwithstanding her accident, upon
going to Madame's apartments.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is the matter, and
why do you limp so?" she inquired; "I mistook you for La
Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais related how it
had happened, that in hurrying on, in order to arrive as quickly
as possible, she had sprained her foot.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame seemed to pity her, and
wished to have a surgeon sent for immediately, but she, assuring
her that there was nothing really serious in the accident, said:
"My only regret, Madame, is, that it will preclude my attendance
on you, and I should have begged Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re to take my place with your royal highness, but -
" seeing that Madame frowned, she added - "I have not done
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why did you not do so?"
inquired Madame.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because poor La
Valli&egrave;re seemed so happy to have her liberty for a whole
evening and night too, that I did not feel courageous enough to
ask her to take my place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What, is she so
delighted as that?" inquired madame, struck by these words.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "She is wild with
delight; she, who is always so melancholy, was singing like a
bird.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, you
highness knows how much she detests going out, and also that her
character has a spice of wildness in it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So!" thought Madame,
"this extreme delight hardly seems natural to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "She has already made
all her preparations for dining in her own room <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
with one of her favorite books.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then, as your highness has six
other young ladies who would be delighted to accompany you, I did
not make my proposal to La Valli&egrave;re."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame did not say a word in
reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have I acted properly?"
continued Montalais, with a slight fluttering of the heart,
seeing the little success that seemed to attend the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>ruse de guerre</i> which she had
relied upon with so much confidence that she had not thought it
even necessary to try and find another.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Does Madame approve of what I have
done?" she continued.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame was reflecting
that the king could very easily leave Saint-Germain during the
night, and that, as it was only four leagues and a half from
Paris to Saint-Germain, he might readily be in Paris in an hour's
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Tell me," she
said, "whether La Valli&egrave;re, when she heard of your
accident, offered at least to bear you company?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! she does not yet
know of my accident; but even did she know of it, I most
certainly should not ask her to do anything that might interfere
with her own plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
think she wishes this evening to realize quietly by herself that
amusement of the late king, when he said to M. de Cinq-Mars, 'Let
us amuse ourselves by doing nothing, and making ourselves
miserable.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame felt convinced
that some mysterious love adventure lurked behind this strong
desire for solitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
secret <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>might</i> be Louis's
return during the night; it could not be doubted any longer La
Valli&egrave;re had been informed of his intended return, and
that was the reason for her delight at having to remain behind at
the Palais Royal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was
a plan settled and arranged beforehand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will not be their
dupe though," said Madame, and she took a decisive step.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Mademoiselle de Montalais,"
she said, "will you have the goodness to inform your friend,
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re, that I am exceedingly sorry
to disarrange her projects of solitude, but that instead of
becoming <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>ennuy&eacute;e</i> by remaining
behind alone as she wished, she will be good enough to accompany
us to Saint-Germain and get <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>ennuy&eacute;e</i> there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! poor La
Valli&egrave;re," said Montalais, compassionately, but with her
heart throbbing with delight; "oh, Madame, could there not be
some means - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Enough," said Madame;
"I desire it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I prefer
Mademoiselle la Baume le Blanc's society to that of any one
else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Go, and send her to
me, and take care of your foot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais did not wait
for the order to be repeated; she returned to her room, almost
forgetting to feign lameness, wrote an answer to Malicorne, and
slipped it under the carpet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The answer simply said: "She
shall."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A Spartan could
not have written more laconically.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "By this means," thought
Madame, "I will look narrowly after all on the road; she shall
sleep near me during the night, and his majesty must be very
clever if he can exchange a single word with Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
received the order to set off with the same indifferent
gentleness with which she had received the order to play
Cinderella.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But,
inwardly, her delight was extreme, and she looked upon this
change in the princess's resolution as a consolation which
Providence had sent her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
With less penetration than Madame possessed, she attributed all
to chance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While every
one, with the exception of those in disgrace, of those who were
ill, and those who were suffering from sprains, were being driven
towards Saint-Germain, Malicorne smuggled his workman into the
palace in one of M. de Saint-Aignan's carriages, and led him into
the room corresponding to La Valli&egrave;re's.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The man set to work with a will,
tempted by the splendid reward which had been promised him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As the very best tools and
implements had been selected from the reserve stock belonging to
the engineers attached to the king's household - and among
others, a saw with teeth so sharp and well tempered that it was
able, under water even, to cut through oaken joists as hard as
iron - the work in question advanced very rapidly, and a square
portion of the ceiling, taken from between two of the joists,
fell into the arms of the delighted Saint-Aignan, Malicorne, the
workman, and a confidential valet, the latter being one brought
into the world to see and hear everything, but to repeat
nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In accordance
with a new plan indicated by Malicorne, the opening was effected
in an angle of the room - and for this reason. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As there was no dressing-closet
adjoining La Valli&egrave;re's room, she had solicited, and had
that very morning obtained, a large screen intended to serve as a
partition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The screen
that had been allotted her was perfectly sufficient to conceal
the opening, which would, besides, be hidden by all the artifices
skilled cabinet-makers would have at their command.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The opening having been made, the
workman glided between the joists, and found himself in La
Valli&egrave;re's room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
When there, he cut a square opening in the flooring, and out of
the boards he manufactured a trap so accurately fitting into the
opening that the most practised eye could hardly detect the
necessary interstices made by its lines of juncture with the
floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne had
provided for everything: a ring and a couple of hinges which had
been bought for the purpose, were affixed to the trap-door; and a
small circular stair-case, packed in sections, had been bought
ready made by the industrious Malicorne, who had paid two
thousand francs for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It was higher than what was required, but the carpenter reduced
the number of steps, and it was found to suit exactly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This staircase, destined to
receive so illustrious a burden, was merely fastened to the wall
by a couple of iron clamps, and its base was fixed into the floor
of the comte's room by two iron pegs screwed down tightly, so
that the king, and all his cabinet councilors too, might pass up
and down the staircase without any fear.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every blow of the hammer fell upon a
thick pad or cushion, and the saw was not used until the handle
had been wrapped in wool, and the blade steeped in oil.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The noisiest part of the work,
moreover, had taken place during the night and early in the
morning, that is to say, when La Valli&egrave;re and Madame were
both absent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When, about
two o'clock in the afternoon, the court returned to the Palais
Royal, La Valli&egrave;re went up into her own room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Everything was in its proper place -
not the smallest particle of sawdust, not the smallest chip, was
left to bear witness to the violation of her domicile.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan, however, wishing
to do his utmost in forwarding the work, had torn his fingers and
his shirt too, and had expended no ordinary amount of
perspiration in the king's service.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The palms of his hands were covered
with blisters, occasioned by his having held the ladder for
Malicorne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had,
moreover, brought up, one by one, the seven pieces of the
staircase, each consisting of two steps.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, we can safely assert that,
if the king had seen him so ardently at work, his majesty would
have sworn an eternal gratitude towards his faithful
attendant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As Malicorne
anticipated, the workman had completely finished the job in
twenty-four hours; he received twenty-four louis, and left,
overwhelmed with delight, for he had gained in one day as much as
six months' hard work would have procured him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No one had the slightest suspicion
of what had taken place in the room under Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re's apartment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But in the evening of the second
day, at the very moment La Valli&egrave;re had just left Madame's
circle and returned to her own room, she heard a slight creaking
sound in one corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Astonished, she looked to see whence it proceeded, and the noise
began again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Who is
there?" she said, in a tone of alarm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is I, Louise,"
replied the well-known voice of the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You! you!" cried the
young girl, who for a moment fancied herself under the influence
of a dream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But
where?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Here," replied the
king, opening one of the folds of the screen, and appearing like
a ghost at the end of the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
uttered a loud cry, and fell trembling into an armchair, as the
king advanced respectfully towards her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style='text-align:center'>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Chapter

'font-size:20.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>
L</span>a Valli&egrave;re very soon recovered from her surprise,
for, owing to his respectful bearing, the king inspired her with
more confidence by his presence than his sudden appearance had
deprived her of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, as
he noticed that which made La Valli&egrave;re most uneasy was the
means by which he had effected an entrance into her room, he
explained to her the system of the staircase concealed by the
screen, and strongly disavowed the notion of his being a
supernatural appearance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, sire!" said La
Valli&egrave;re, shaking her fair head with a most engaging
smile, "present or absent, you do not appear to my mind more at
one time than at another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Which means, Louise -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, what you know so
well, sire; that there is not one moment in which the poor girl
whose secret you surprised at Fontainebleau, and whom you came to
snatch from the foot of the cross itself, does not think of
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Louise, you overwhelm
me with joy and happiness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
smiled mournfully, and continued: "But, sire, have you reflected
that your ingenious invention could not be of the slightest
service to us?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tell me, - I am waiting most
anxiously."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because this room may
be subject to being searched at any moment of the day.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame herself may, at any
time, come here accidentally; my companions run in at any moment
they please.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To fasten
the door on the inside, is to denounce myself as plainly as if I
had written above, 'No admittance, - the king is within!'<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Even now, sire, at this very
moment, there is nothing to prevent the door opening, and your
majesty being seen here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case," said the
king, laughingly, "I should indeed be taken for a phantom, for no
one can tell in what way I came here.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, it is only spirits that can
pass through brick walls, or floors and ceilings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, sire, reflect for a
moment how terrible the scandal would be!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing equal to it could ever have
been previously said about the maids of honor, poor creatures!
whom evil report, however, hardly ever spares."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And your conclusion
from all this, my dear Louise, - come, explain yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas! it is a hard
thing to say - but your majesty must suppress staircase plots,
surprises and all; for the evil consequences which would result
from your being found here would be far greater than our
happiness in seeing each other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, Louise," replied
the king, tenderly, "instead of removing this staircase by which
I have ascended, there is a far more simple means, of which you
have not thought."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A means - another
means!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, another.<span

love you, Louise, since my invention is quicker than yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She looked at the king,
who held out his hand to her, which she took and gently pressed
between her own.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You were saying,"
continued the king, "that I shall be detected coming here, where
any one who pleases can enter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stay, sire; at this
very moment, even while you are speaking about it, I tremble with
dread of your being discovered."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But you would not be
found out, Louise, if you were to descend the staircase which
leads to the room underneath."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, sire! what do you
say?" cried Louise, in alarm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do not quite
understand me, Louise, since you get offended at my very first
word; first of all, do you know to whom the apartments underneath
belong?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To M. de Guiche, sire,
I believe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you sure?" cried La
Valli&egrave;re; and this exclamation which escaped from the
young girl's joyous heart made the king's heart throb with
delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, to Saint-Aignan,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>our friend</i>," he
said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, sire," returned La
Valli&egrave;re, "I cannot visit M. de Saint-Aignan's rooms any
more than I could M. de Guiche's.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is impossible - impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet, Louise, I
should have thought that, under the safe-conduct of the king, you
would venture anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Under the safe-conduct
of the king," she said, with a look full of tenderness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have faith in my
word, I hope, Louise?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire, when you are
not present; but when you are present, - when you speak to me, -
when I look upon you, I have faith in nothing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What can possibly be
done to reassure you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is scarcely
respectful, I know, to doubt the king, but - for me - you are <i

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank Heaven! - I, at
least, hope so most devoutly; you see how anxiously I am trying
to find or invent a means of removing all difficulty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Stay; would the presence of a third
person reassure you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The presence of M. de
Saint-Aignan would, certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Really, Louise, you
wound me by your suspicions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louise did not answer,
she merely looked steadfastly at him with that clear, piercing
gaze which penetrates the very heart, and said softly to herself,
"Alas! alas! it is not you of whom I am afraid, - it is not you
upon whom my doubts would fall."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said the king,
sighing, "I agree; and M. de Saint-Aignan, who enjoys the
inestimable privilege of reassuring you, shall always be present
at our interviews, I promise you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You promise that,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Upon my honor as a
gentleman; and you, on your side - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, wait, sire, that is
not all yet; for such conversations ought, at least, to have a
reasonable motive of some kind for M. de Saint-Aignan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Dear Louise, every
shade of delicacy of feeling is yours, and my only study is to
equal you on that point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It shall be just as you wish: therefore our conversations shall
have a reasonable motive, and I have already hit upon one; so
that from to-morrow, if you like - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To-morrow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you meant that that
is not soon enough?" exclaimed the king, caressing La
Valli&egrave;re's hand between his own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this moment the sound
of steps was heard in the corridor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire! sire!" cried La
Valli&egrave;re, "some one is coming; do you hear?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, fly! fly!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I implore you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king made but one
bound from the chair where he was sitting to his hiding-place
behind the screen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had
barely time; for as he drew one of the folds before him, the
handle of the door was turned, and Montalais appeared at the
threshold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As a matter of
course she entered quite naturally, and without any ceremony, for
she knew perfectly well that to knock at the door beforehand
would be showing a suspicion towards La Valli&egrave;re which
would be displeasing to her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She accordingly entered, and after a
rapid glance round the room, in the brief course of which she
observed two chairs very close to each other, she was so long in
shutting the door, which seemed to be difficult to close, one can
hardly tell how or why, that the king had ample time to raise the
trap-door, and to descend again to Saint-Aignan's room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Louise," she said to
her, "I want to talk to you, and seriously, too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Aure, what is the matter now?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame suspects <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Explain yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is there any occasion
for us to enter into explanations, and do you not understand what
I mean?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, you must
have noticed the fluctuations in Madame's humor during several
days past; you must have noticed how she first kept you close
beside her, then dismissed you, and then sent for you again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I have noticed it,
of course."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, it seems Madame
has now succeeded in obtaining sufficient information, for she
has now gone straight to the point, as there is nothing further
left in France to withstand the torrent which sweeps away all
obstacles before it; you know what I mean by the torrent?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re hid
her face in her hands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean," continued
Montalais, pitilessly, "that torrent which burst through the
gates of the Carmelites of Chaillot, and overthrew all the
prejudices of the court, as well at Fontainebleau as at
Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alas! alas!" murmured
La Valli&egrave;re, her face still covered by her hands, and her
tears streaming through her fingers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, don't distress
yourself in that manner, or you have only heard half of your
troubles."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In Heaven's name,"
exclaimed the young girl, in great anxiety, "what is the
matter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, this is how
the matter stands: Madame, who can no longer rely upon any
further assistance in France; for she has, one after the other,
made use of the two queens, of Monsieur, and the whole court,
too, now bethinks herself of a certain person who has certain
pretended rights over you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
became as white as a marble statue.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This person," continued
Madame, "is not in Paris at this moment; but, if I am not
mistaken, is, just now, in England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes," breathed La
Valli&egrave;re, almost overwhelmed with terror.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And is to be found, I
think, at the court of Charles II.; am I right?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, this
evening a letter has been dispatched by Madame to Saint James's,
with directions for the courier to go straight to Hampton Court,
which I believe is one of the royal residences, situated about a
dozen miles from London."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well; as Madame writes
regularly to London once a fortnight, and as the ordinary courier
left for London not more than three days ago, I have been
thinking that some serious circumstance alone could have induced
her to write again so soon, for you know she is a very indolent
correspondent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

repeated the unhappy girl, mechanically.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I, who saw the
letter lying on Madame's desk before she sealed it, fancied I
could read - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I might
possibly have been mistaken, though - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The name of
Bragelonne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re rose
hurriedly from her chair, a prey to the most painful
agitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Montalais,"
she said, her voice broken by sobs, "all my smiling dreams of
youth and innocence have fled already.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have nothing now to conceal,
either from you or any one else.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My life is exposed to every one's
inspection, and can be opened like a book, in which all the world
can read, from the king himself to the first passer-by.<span

do - what will become of me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais approached
close to her, and said, "Consult your own heart, of course."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

de Bragelonne; when I say I do not love him, understand that I
love him as the most affectionate sister could love the best of
brothers, but that is not what he requires, nor what I promised
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In fact, you love the
king," said Montalais, "and that is a sufficiently good
excuse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I do love the
king," hoarsely murmured the young girl, "and I have paid dearly
enough for pronouncing those words.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And now, Montalais, tell me - what
can you do either for me, or against me, in my position?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You must speak more
clearly still."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What am I to say,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And so you have nothing
very particular to tell me?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No!" said
Louise, in astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good; and so all
you have to ask me is my advice respecting M. Raoul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing else."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is a
very delicate subject," replied Montalais.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, it is nothing of
the kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ought I to
marry him in order to keep the promise I made, or ought I
continue to listen to the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have really placed
me in a very difficult position," said Montalais, smiling; "you
ask me if you ought to marry Raoul, whose friend I am, and whom I
shall mortally offend in giving my opinion against him; and then,
you ask me if you should cease to listen to the king, whose
subject I am, and whom I should offend if I were to advise you in
a particular way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah,
Louise, you seem to hold a difficult position at a very cheap
rate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have not understood
me, Aure," said La Valli&egrave;re, wounded by the slightly
mocking tone of her companion; "if I were to marry M. de
Bragelonne, I should be far from bestowing on him the happiness
he deserves; but, for the same reason, if I listen to the king he

aspects, I admit, but one whom his affection confers an
appearance of value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What
I ask you, then, is to tell me some means of disengaging myself
honorably either from the one or from the other; or rather, I ask
you, from which side you think I can free myself most
honorably."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear Louise,"
replied Montalais, after a pause, "I am not one of the seven wise
men of Greece, and I have no perfectly invariable rules of
conduct to govern me; but, on the other hand, I have a little
experience, and I can assure you that no woman ever asks for
advice of the nature which you have just asked me, without being
in a terrible state of embarrassment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, you have made a solemn
promise, which every principle of honor requires you to fulfil;
if, therefore, you are embarrassed, in consequence of having
undertaken such an engagement, it is not a stranger's advice
(every one is a stranger to a heart full of love), it is not my
advice, I repeat, that can extricate you from your
embarrassment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall
not give it you, therefore; and for a greater reason still -
because, were I in your place, I should feel much more
embarrassed after the advice than before it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All I can do is, to repeat what I
have already told you; shall I assist you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very well;
that is all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Tell me in
what way you wish me to help you; tell me for and against whom, -
in this way we shall not make any blunders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But first of all," said
La Valli&egrave;re, pressing her companion's hand, "for whom or
against whom do you decide?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For you, if you are
really and truly my friend."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you not
Madame's confidant?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A greater reason for
being of service to you; if I were not to know what is going on
in that direction I should not be of any service at all, and
consequently you would not obtain any advantage from my
acquaintance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Friendships
live and thrive upon a system of reciprocal benefits."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The result is, then,
that you will remain at the same time Madame's friend also?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you complain of that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I hardly know," sighed
La Valli&egrave;re, thoughtfully, for this cynical frankness
appeared to her an offense both to the woman and the friend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "All well and good,
then," said Montalais, "for if you did, you would be very
foolish."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You wish to serve me,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

serve me in return."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "One would almost say
that you do not know my heart," said La Valli&egrave;re, looking
at Montalais with her eyes wide open.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, the fact is, that

down her head, and began to weep.<span style=

"Poor king!" she kissed Louise on the forehead, and returned to
her apartment, where Malicorne was waiting for her.</p>

I</span>n that malady which is termed love the paroxysms succeed
each other at intervals, ever accelerating from the moment the
disease declares itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
By and by, the paroxysms are less frequent, in proportion as the
cure approaches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This
being laid down as a general axiom, and as the leading article of
a particular chapter, we will now proceed with our recital.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The next day, the day fixed by
the king for the first conversation in Saint-Aignan's room, La
Valli&egrave;re, on opening one of the folds of the screen, found
upon the floor a letter in the king's handwriting.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The letter had been passed, through
a slit in the floor, from the lower apartment to her own.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No indiscreet hand or curious
gaze could have brought or did bring this single paper.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This, too, was one of
Malicorne's ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Having
seen how very serviceable Saint-Aignan would become to the king
on account of his apartment, he did not wish that the courtier
should become still more indispensable as a messenger, and so he
had, on his own private account, reserved this last post for
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La
Valli&egrave;re most eagerly read the letter, which fixed two
o'clock that same afternoon for the rendezvous, and which
indicated the way of raising the trap-door which was constructed
out of the flooring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Make yourself look as beautiful as you can," added the
postscript of the letter, words which astonished the young girl,
but at the same time reassured her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The hours passed away
very slowly, but the time fixed, however, arrived at last.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As punctual as the priestess
Hero, Louise lifted up the trap-door at the last stroke of the
hour of two, and found the king on the steps, waiting for her
with the greatest respect, in order to give her his hand to
descend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The delicacy and
deference shown in this attention affected her very
powerfully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the foot
of the staircase the two lovers found the comte, who, with a
smile and a low reverence distinguished by the best taste,
expressed his thanks to La Valli&egrave;re for the honor she
conferred upon him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then
turning towards the king, he said:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, our man is
here."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re
looked at the king with some uneasiness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Mademoiselle," said the
king, "if I have begged you to do me the honor of coming down
here, it was from an interested motive.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have procured a most admirable
portrait painter, who is celebrated for the fidelity of his
likenesses, and I wish you to be kind enough to authorize him to
paint yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, if
you positively wish it, the portrait shall remain in your own
possession."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La
Valli&egrave;re blushed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"You see," said the king to her, "we shall not be three as you
wished, but four instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And, so long as we are not alone, there can be as many present as
you please."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La
Valli&egrave;re gently pressed her royal lover's hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Shall we pass into the
next room, sire?" said Saint-Aignan, opening the door to let his
guests precede him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king walked behind La Valli&egrave;re, and fixed his eyes
lingeringly and passionately upon that neck as white as snow,
upon which her long fair ringlets fell in heavy masses.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re was dressed
in a thick silk robe of pearl gray color, with a tinge of rose,
with jet ornaments, which displayed to greater effect the
dazzling purity of her skin, holding in her slender and
transparent hands a bouquet of heartsease, Bengal roses, and
clematis, surrounded with leaves of the tenderest green, above
which uprose, like a tiny goblet spilling magic influence a
Haarlem tulip of gray and violet tints of a pure and beautiful
species, which had cost the gardener five years' toil of
combinations, and the king five thousand francs.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis had placed this bouquet in La
Valli&egrave;re's hand as he saluted her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the room, the door of which
Saint-Aignan had just opened, a young man was standing, dressed
in a purple velvet jacket, with beautiful black eyes and long
brown hair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was the
painter; his canvas was quite ready, and his palette prepared for
use.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He bowed to La
Valli&egrave;re with the grave curiosity of an artist who is
studying his model, saluted the king discreetly, as if he did not
recognize him, and as he would, consequently, have saluted any
other gentleman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then,
leading Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re to the seat he had
arranged for her, he begged her to sit down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young girl assumed
an attitude graceful and unrestrained, her hands occupied and her
limbs reclining on cushions; and in order that her gaze might not
assume a vague or affected expression, the painter begged her to
choose some kind of occupation, so as to engage her attention;
whereupon Louis XIV., smiling, sat down on the cushions at La
Valli&egrave;re's feet; so that she, in the reclining posture she
had assumed, leaning back in the armchair, holding her flowers in
her hand, and he, with his eyes raised towards her and fixed
devouringly on her face - they, both together, formed so charming
a group, that the artist contemplated painting it with
professional delight, while on his side, Saint-Aignan regarded
them with feelings of envy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The painter sketched rapidly; and
very soon, beneath the earliest touches of the brush, there
started into life, out of the gray background, the gentle,
poetry-breathing face, with its soft calm eyes and delicately
tinted cheeks, enframed in the masses of hair which fell about
her neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lovers,
however, spoke but little, and looked at each other a great deal;
sometimes their eyes became so languishing in their gaze, that
the painter was obliged to interrupt his work in order to avoid
representing an Erycina instead of La Valli&egrave;re.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was on such occasions that
Saint-Aignan came to the rescue, and recited verses, or repeated
one of those little tales such as Patru related, and Tallemant
des R&eacute;aux wrote so cleverly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Or, it might be that La
Valli&egrave;re was fatigued, and the sitting was, therefore,
suspended for awhile; and, immediately, a tray of precious
porcelain laden with the most beautiful fruits which could be
obtained, and rich wines distilling their bright colors in silver
goblets, beautifully chased, served as accessories to the picture
of which the painter could but retrace the most ephemeral
resemblance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis was intoxicated
with love, La Valli&egrave;re with happiness, Saint-Aignan with
ambition, and the painter was storing up recollections for his
old age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two hours passed
away in this manner, and four o'clock having struck, La
Valli&egrave;re rose, and made a sign to the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis also rose, approached the
picture, and addressed a few flattering remarks to the
painter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan
also praised the picture, which, as he pretended, was already
beginning to assume an accurate resemblance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re in her turn,
blushingly thanked the painter and passed into the next room,
where the king followed her, after having previously summoned
Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will you not come
to-morrow?" he said to La Valli&egrave;re.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire, pray think
that some one will be sure to come to my room, and will not find
me there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What will become of me
in that case?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are
very apprehensive, Louise."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But at all events,
suppose Madame were to send for me?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!"
replied the king, "will the day never come when you yourself will
tell me to brave everything so that I may not have to leave you
again?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "On that
day, sire, I shall be quite out of my mind, and you must not
believe me."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To-morrow,
Louise."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La
Valli&egrave;re sighed, but, without the courage to oppose her
royal lover's wish, she repeated, "To-morrow, then, since you
desire it, sire," and with these words she ran lightly up the
stairs, and disappeared from her lover's gaze.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, sire?" inquired
Saint-Aignan, when she had left.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, Saint-Aignan,
yesterday I thought myself the happiest of men."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And does your majesty,
then, regard yourself to-day," said the comte, smiling, "as the
unhappiest of men?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; but my love for her
is an unquenchable thirst; in vain do I drink, in vain do I
swallow the drops of water which your industry procures for me;
the more I drink, the more unquenchable it becomes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, that is in some
degree your own fault, and your majesty alone has made the
position such as it is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case,
therefore, the means to be happy, is to fancy yourself satisfied,
and to wait."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Wait! you know that
word, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There, there, sire - do
not despair: I have already been at work on your behalf - I have
still other resources in store."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king shook his head in a
despairing manner.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What, sire! have you
not been satisfied hitherto?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! yes, indeed, yes,
my dear Saint-Aignan; but invent, for Heaven's sake, invent some
further project yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I undertake to do
my best, and that is all that any one can do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king wished to see
the portrait again, as he was unable to see the original.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He pointed out several
alterations to the painter and left the room, and then
Saint-Aignan dismissed the artist.<span style=

for the cloud which had passed across the royal sun, veiled, in
its turn, the faithful satellite, and Malicorne at a glance
perceived the melancholy that brooded on Saint-Aignan's face.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

T</span>he revelation we have witnessed, that Montalais made to
La Valli&egrave;re, in a preceding chapter, very naturally makes
us return to the principal hero of this tale, a poor wandering
knight, roving about at the king's caprice.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If our readers will be good enough
to follow us, we will, in his company, cross that strait, more
stormy than the Euripus, which separates Calais from Dover; we
will speed across that green and fertile country, with its
numerous little streams; through Maidstone, and many other
villages and towns, each prettier than the other; and, finally,
arrive at London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From
thence, like bloodhounds following a track, after having
ascertained that Raoul had made his first stay at Whitehall, his
second at St. James's, and having learned that he had been warmly
received by Monk, and introduced to the best society of Charles
II.'s court, we will follow him to one of Charles II.'s summer
residences near the lively little village of Kingston, at Hampton
Court, situated on the Thames.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The river is not, at that spot, the
boastful highway which bears upon its broad bosom its thousands
of travelers; nor are its waters black and troubled as those of
Cocytus, as it boastfully asserts, "I, too, am cousin of the old
ocean."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, at Hampton
Court it is a soft and murmuring stream, with moss-fringed banks,
reflecting, in its broad mirror, the willows and beeches which
ornament its sides, and on which may occasionally be seen a light
bark indolently reclining among the tall reeds, in a little creek
formed of alders and forget-me-nots.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The surrounding country on all sides
smiled in happiness and wealth; the brick cottages from whose
chimneys the blue smoke was slowly ascending in wreaths, peeped
forth from the belts of green holly which environed them;
children dressed in red frocks appeared and disappeared amidst
the high grass, like poppies bowed by the gentler breath of the
passing breeze.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
sheep, ruminating with half-closed eyes, lay lazily about under
the shadow of the stunted aspens, while, far and near, the
kingfishers, plumed with emerald and gold, skimmed swiftly along
the surface of the water, like a magic ball heedlessly touching,
as he passed, the line of his brother angler, who sat watching in
his boat the fish as they rose to the surface of the sparkling
stream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> High above this
paradise of dark shadows and soft light, rose the palace of
Hampton Court, built by Wolsey - a residence the haughty cardinal
had been obliged, timid courtier that he was, to offer to his
master, Henry VIII., who had glowered with envy and cupidity at
the magnificent new home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Hampton Court, with its brick walls, its large windows, its
handsome iron gates, as well as its curious bell turrets, its
retired covered walks, and interior fountains, like those of the
Alhambra, was a perfect bower of roses, jasmine, and
clematis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every sense,
sight and smell particularly, was gratified, and the
reception-rooms formed a very charming framework for the pictures
of love which Charles II. unrolled among the voluptuous paintings
of Titian, of Pordenone and of Van Dyck; the same Charles whose
father's portrait - the martyr king - was hanging in his gallery,
and who could show upon the wainscots of the various apartments
the holes made by the balls of the puritanical followers of
Cromwell, when on the 24th of August, 1648, at the time they had
brought Charles I. prisoner to Hampton Court.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There it was that the king,
intoxicated with pleasure and adventure, held his court - he,
who, a poet in feeling, thought himself justified in redeeming,
by a whole day of voluptuousness, every minute which had been
formerly passed in anguish and misery.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not the soft green sward of
Hampton Court - so soft that it almost resembled the richest
velvet in the thickness of its texture - nor was it the beds of
flowers, with their variegated hues which encircled the foot of
every tree with rose-trees many feet in height, embracing most
lovingly their trunks - nor even the enormous lime-trees, whose
branches swept the earth like willows, offering a ready
concealment for love or reflection beneath the shade of their
foliage - it was none of these things for which Charles II. loved
his palace of Hampton Court.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps it might have been that
beautiful sheet of water, which the cool breeze rippled like the
wavy undulations of Cleopatra's hair, waters bedecked with
cresses and white water-lilies, whose chaste bulbs coyly
unfolding themselves beneath the sun's warm rays, reveal the
golden gems which lie concealed within their milky petals -
murmuring waters, on the bosom of which black swans majestically
floated, and the graceful water-fowl, with their tender broods
covered with silken down, darted restlessly in every direction,
in pursuit of the insects among the reeds, or the fogs in their
mossy retreats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps
it might have been the enormous hollies, with their dark and
tender green foliage; or the bridges uniting the banks of the
canals in their embrace; or the fawns browsing in the endless
avenues of the park; or the innumerable birds that hopped about
the gardens, or flew from branch to branch, amidst the emerald
foliage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It might well have been
any of these charms - for Hampton Court had them all; and
possessed, too, almost forests of white roses, which climbed and
trailed along the lofty trellises, showering down upon the ground
their snowy leaves rich with soft perfumery.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But no, what Charles II. most loved
in Hampton Court were the charming figures who, when midday was
past, flitted to and fro along the broad terraces of the gardens;
like Louis XIV., he had their wealth of beauties painted for his
gallery by one of the great artists of the period - an artist who
well knew the secret of transferring to canvas the rays of light
which escaped from beaming eyes heavy laden with love and love's
delights.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The day of our arrival
at Hampton Court is almost as clear and bright as a summer's day
in France; the atmosphere is heavy with the delicious perfume of
geraniums, sweet-peas, seringas, and heliotrope scattered in
profusion around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is
past midday, and the king, having dined after his return from
hunting, paid a visit to Lady Castlemaine, the lady who was
reputed at the time to hold his heart in bondage; and this proof
of his devotion discharged, he was readily permitted to pursue
his infidelities until evening arrived.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Love and amusement ruled the entire
court; it was the period when ladies would seriously interrogate
their ruder companions as to their opinions upon a foot more or
less captivating, according to whether it wore a pink or lilac
silk stocking - for it was the period when Charles II. had
declared that there was no hope of safety for a woman who wore
green silk stockings, because Miss Lucy Stewart wore them of that
color.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While the king is
endeavoring in all directions to inculcate others with his
preferences on this point, we will ourselves bend our steps
towards an avenue of beech-trees opposite the terrace, and listen
to the conversation of a young girl in a dark-colored dress, who
is walking with another of about her own age dressed in
blue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They crossed a
beautiful lawn, from the center of which sprang a fountain, with
the figure of a siren executed in bronze, and strolled on,
talking as they went, towards the terrace, along which, looking
out upon the park and interspersed at frequent intervals, were
erected summer-houses, diverse in form and ornament; these
summer-houses were nearly all occupied; the two young women
passed on, the one blushing deeply, while the other seemed
dreamily silent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At last,
having reached the end of the terrace which looks on the river,
and finding there a cool retreat, they sat down close to each
other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Where are we going?"
said the younger to her companion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My dear, we are going
where you yourself led the way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, you; to the
extremity of the palace, towards that seat yonder, where the
young Frenchman is seated, wasting his time in sighs and
lamentations."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Miss Mary Grafton
hurriedly said, "No, no; I am not going there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why not?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let us go
back, Lucy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nay, on the contrary,
let us go on, and have an explanation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What about?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "About how it happens
that the Vicomte de Bragelonne always accompanies you in all your
walks, as you invariably accompany him in his."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you conclude either
that he loves me, or that I love him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why not? - he is a most
agreeable and charming companion. - No one hears me, I hope,"
said Lucy Stewart, as she turned round with a smile, which
indicated, moreover, that her uneasiness on the subject was not
extreme.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no," said Mary,
"the king is engaged in his summer-house with the Duke of
Buckingham."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&agrave; propos</i> of the duke,
Mary, it seems he has shown you great attention since his return
from France; how is your own heart in that direction?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mary Grafton shrugged
her shoulders with seeming indifference.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, well, I will ask
Bragelonne about it," said Stewart, laughing; "let us go and find
him at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What for?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I wish to
speak to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not yet, one word
before you do: come, come, you who know so many of the king's
secrets, tell me why M. de Bragelonne is in England?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because he
was sent as an envoy from one sovereign to another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That may be; but,
seriously, although politics do not much concern us, we know
enough to be satisfied that M. de Bragelonne has no mission of
serious import here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, listen,"
said Stewart, with assumed gravity, "for your sake I am going to
betray a state secret.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Shall I tell you the nature of the letter which King Louis XIV.
gave M. de Bragelonne for King Charles II.?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will; these are the very words:
'My brother, the bearer of this is a gentleman attached to my
court, and the son of one whom you regard most warmly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Treat him kindly, I beg, and
try and make him like England.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Did it say that!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Word for word - or
something very like it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
will not answer for the form, but the substance I am sure
of."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, and what
conclusion do you, or rather what conclusion does the king, draw
from that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That the king of France
has his own reasons for removing M. de Bragelonne, and for
getting him married anywhere else than in France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So that, then, in
consequence of this letter - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "King Charles received
M. de Bragelonne, as you are aware, in the most distinguished and
friendly manner; the handsomest apartments in Whitehall were
allotted to him; and as you are the most valuable and precious
person in his court, inasmuch as you have rejected his heart, -
nay, do not blush, - he wished you to take a fancy to this
Frenchman, and he was desirous to confer upon him so costly a
prize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And this is the
reason why you, the heiress of three hundred thousand pounds, a
future duchess, so beautiful, so good, have been thrown in
Bragelonne's way, in all the promenades and parties of pleasure
to which he was invited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
In fact it was a plot, - a kind of conspiracy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mary Grafton smiled with
that charming expression which was habitual to her, and pressing
her companion's arm, said: "Thank the king, Lucy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes, but the Duke
of Buckingham is jealous, so take care."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Hardly had she
pronounced these words, when the duke appeared from one of the
pavilions on the terrace, and, approaching the two girls, with a
smile, said, "You are mistaken, Miss Lucy; I am not jealous; and
the proof, Miss Mary, is yonder, in the person of M. de
Bragelonne himself, who ought to be the cause of my jealousy, but
who is dreaming in pensive solitude.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Poor fellow!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Allow me to leave you for a few
minutes, while I avail myself of those few minutes to converse
with Miss Lucy Stewart, to whom I have something to say."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then, bowing to Lucy, he
added, "Will you do me the honor to accept my hand, in order that
I may lead you to the king, who is waiting for us?"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With these words, Buckingham, still
smiling, took Miss Stewart's hand, and led her away.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When by herself, Mary Grafton, her
head gently inclined towards her shoulder, with that indolent
gracefulness of action which distinguishes young English girls,
remained for a moment with her eyes fixed on Raoul, but as if
uncertain what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
last, after first blushing violently, and then turning deadly
pale, thus revealing the internal combat which assailed her
heart, she seemed to make up her mind to adopt a decided course,
and with a tolerably firm step, advanced towards the seat on
which Raoul was reclining, buried in the profoundest meditation,
as we have already said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The sound of Miss Mary's steps, though they could hardly be heard
upon the green sward, awakened Raoul from his musing attitude; he
turned round, perceived the young girl, and walked forward to
meet the companion whom his happy destiny had thrown in his
way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have been sent to
you, monsieur," said Mary Grafton; "will you take care of
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To whom is my gratitude
due, for so great a happiness?" inquired Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To the Duke of
Buckingham," replied Mary, affecting a gayety she did not really
feel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To the Duke of
Buckingham, do you say? - he who so passionately seeks your
charming society!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Am I
really to believe you are serious, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The fact is, monsieur,
you perceive, that everything seems to conspire to make us pass
the best, or rather the longest, part of our days together.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yesterday it was the king who
desired me to beg you to seat yourself next to me at dinner;
to-day, it is the Duke of Buckingham who begs me to come and
place myself near you on this seat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And he has gone away in
order to leave us together?" asked Raoul, with some
embarrassment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Look yonder, at the
turning of that path; he is just out of sight, with Miss
Stewart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are these polite
attentions usual in France, monsieur le vicomte?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I cannot very precisely
say what people do in France, mademoiselle, for I can hardly be
called a Frenchman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
have resided in many countries, and almost always as a solider;
and then, I have spent a long period of my life in the
country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am almost a
savage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do not like your
residence in England, I fear."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I scarcely know," said
Raoul, inattentively, and sighing deeply at the same time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What! you do not
know?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Forgive me," said
Raoul, shaking his head, and collecting his thoughts, "I did not
hear you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said the young
girl, sighing in her turn, "how wrong the duke was to send me
here!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Wrong!" said Raoul,
"perhaps so; for I am but a rude, uncouth companion, and my
society annoys you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
duke did, indeed, very wrong to send you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is precisely,"
replied Mary Grafton, in a clear, calm voice, "because your
society does not annoy me, that the duke was wrong to send me to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was now Raoul's turn
to blush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But," he
resumed, "how happens it that the Duke of Buckingham should send
you to me; and why did you come? the duke loves you, and you love
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No," replied Mary,
seriously, "the duke does not love me, because he is in love with
the Duchesse d'Orl&eacute;ans; and, as for myself, I have no
affection for the duke."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul looked at the
young lady with astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you a friend of the
Duke of Buckingham?" she inquired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The duke has honored me
by calling me so ever since we met in France."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are simple
acquaintances, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; for the duke is the
most intimate friend of one whom I regard as a brother."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The Duc de Guiche?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He who is
in love with Madame la Duchesse d'Orl&eacute;ans?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is that you are saying?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And who
loves him in return," continued the young girl, quietly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul bent down his
head, and Mary Grafton, sighing deeply, continued, "They are very
happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, leave me,
Monsieur de Bragelonne, for the Duke of Buckingham has given you
a very troublesome commission in offering me as a companion for
your promenade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your
heart is elsewhere, and it is with the greatest difficulty you
can be charitable enough to lend me your attention.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Confess truly; it would be unfair on
your part, vicomte, not to admit it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame, I do confess
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She looked at him
steadily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was so noble
and so handsome in his bearing, his eyes revealed so much
gentleness, candor, and resolution, that the idea could not
possibly enter her mind that he was either rudely discourteous,
or a mere simpleton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She
only perceived, clearly enough, that he loved another woman, and
not herself, with the whole strength of his heart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I now understand you," she said;
"you have left your heart behind you in France."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul bowed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The duke is aware of your
affection?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No one knows it,"
replied Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, therefore, do you
tell me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nay, answer
me."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I
cannot."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is for
me, then, to anticipate an explanation; you do not wish to tell
me anything, because you are now convinced that I do not love the
duke; because you see that I possibly might have loved you;
because you are a gentleman of noble and delicate sentiments; and
because, instead of accepting, even were it for the mere
amusement of the passing hour, a hand which is almost pressed
upon you; and because, instead of meeting my smiles with a
smiling lip, you, who are young, have preferred to tell me, whom
men have called beautiful, 'My heart is over the sea - it is in
France.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For this, I
thank you, Monsieur de Bragelonne; you are, indeed, a
noble-hearted, noble-minded man, and I regard you all the more
for it, as a friend only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And now let us cease speaking of myself, and talk of your own
affairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Forget that I
have ever spoken to you of myself, tell me why you are sad, and
why you have become more than usually so during these past four
days?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul was deeply and
sensibly moved by these sweet and melancholy tones; and as he
could not, at the moment, find a word to say, the young girl
again came to his assistance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Pity me," she
said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My mother was born
in France, and I can truly affirm that I, too, am French in
blood, as well as in feeling; but the leaden atmosphere and
characteristic gloom of England seem to weigh upon me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sometimes my dreams are
golden-hued and full of wonderful enjoyments, when suddenly a
mist rises and overspreads my fancy, blotting them out
forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such, indeed, is
the case at the present moment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Forgive me; I have now said enough
on that subject; give me your hand, and relate you griefs to me
as a friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You say you are French
in heart and soul?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, not only, I repeat
it, that my mother was French, but, further, as my father, a
friend of King Charles I., was exiled in France, I, during the
trial of that prince, as well as during the Protector's life, was
brought up in Paris; at the Restoration of King Charles II., my
poor father returned to England, where he died almost immediately
afterwards; and then the king created me a duchess, and has
dowered me according to my rank.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Have you any relations
in France?" Raoul inquired, with the deepest interest.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have a sister there,
my senior by seven or eight years, who was married in France, and
was early left a widow; her name is Madame de
Belli&egrave;re.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you
know her?" she added, observing Raoul start suddenly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have heard her
name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "She, too, loves with
her whole heart; and her last letters inform me she is happy, and
her affection is, I conclude, returned.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I told you, Monsieur de Bragelonne,
that although I possess half of her nature, I do not share her
happiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But let us now
speak of yourself; whom do you love in France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A young girl, as soft
and pure as a lily."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But if she loves you,
why are you sad?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have been told that
she ceases to love me."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do not
believe it, I trust?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He who
wrote me so does not sign his letter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "An anonymous
denunciation! some treachery, be assured," said Miss Grafton.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stay," said Raoul,
showing the young girl a letter which he had read over a thousand
times; she took it from his hand and read as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "VICOMTE, - You are
perfectly right to amuse yourself yonder with the lovely faces of
Charles II.'s court, for at Louis XIV.'s court, the castle in
which your affections are enshrined is being besieged.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Stay in London altogether,
poor vicomte, or return without delay to Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is no signature,"
said Miss Mary.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "None."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Believe it not,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good; but here is
a second letter, from my friend De Guiche, which says, 'I am
lying here wounded and ill.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Return, Raoul, oh, return!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you intend
doing?" inquired the young girl, with a feeling of oppression at
her heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My intention, as soon
as I received this letter, was immediately to take my leave of
the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "When did you receive
it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The day before
yesterday."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is dated
Fontainebleau."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A singular
circumstance, do you not think, for the court is now at
Paris?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At all events, I
would have set off; but when I mentioned my intention to the
king, he began to laugh, and said to me, 'How comes it, monsieur
l'amassadeur, that you think of leaving?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Has your sovereign recalled
you?'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I colored,
naturally enough, for I was confused by the question; for the
fact is, the king himself sent me here, and I have received no
order to return."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mary frowned in deep
thought, and said, "Do you remain, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I must,
mademoiselle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you ever receive any
letters from her to whom you are so devoted?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Never."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Never, do
you say?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Does she not
love you, then?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At least,
she has not written to me since my departure, although she used
occasionally to write to me before.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I trust she may have been
prevented."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Hush! the duke is
coming."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And Buckingham at that
moment was seen at the end of the walk, approaching towards them,
alone and smiling; he advanced slowly, and held out his hands to
them both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Have you
arrived at an understanding?" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "About what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "About whatever might
render you happy, dear Mary, and make Raoul less miserable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not understand
you, my lord," said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is my view of the
subject, Miss Mary; do you wish me to mention it before M. de
Bragelonne?" he added, with a smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If you mean," replied
the young girl, haughtily, "that I was not indisposed to love M.
de Bragelonne, that is useless, for I have told him so
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Buckingham reflected for
a moment, and, without seeming in any way discountenanced, as she
expected, he said:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My
reason for leaving you with M. de Bragelonne was, that I
thoroughly knew your refined delicacy of feeling, no less than
the perfect loyalty of your mind and heart, and I hoped that M.
de Bragelonne's cure might be effected by the hands of a
physician such as you are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, my lord, before
you spoke of M. de Bragelonne's heart, you spoke to me of your
own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you mean to
effect the cure of two hearts at the same time?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Perfectly true, madame;
but you will do me the justice to admit that I have long
discontinued a useless pursuit, acknowledging that my own wound
is incurable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord," said Mary,
collecting herself for a moment before she spoke, "M. de
Bragelonne is happy, for he loves and is beloved.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He has no need of such a physician
as I can be."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. de Bragelonne," said
Buckingham, "is on the very eve of experiencing a serious
misfortune, and he has greater need than ever of sympathy and
affection."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Explain yourself, my
lord," inquired Raoul, anxiously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; gradually I will
explain myself; but, if you desire it, I can tell Miss Grafton
what you may not listen to yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My lord, you are
putting me to the torture; you know something you wish to conceal
from me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know that Miss Mary
Grafton is the most charming object that a heart ill at ease
could possibly meet with in its way through life."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have already told you
that the Vicomte de Bragelonne loves elsewhere," said the young
girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He is wrong, then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you assume to know,
my lord, that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i> am
wrong?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whom is it that he
loves, then?" exclaimed the young girl.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He loves a lady who is
unworthy of him," said Buckingham, with that calm, collected
manner peculiar to Englishmen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Miss Grafton uttered a
cry, which, together with the remark that Buckingham had that
moment made, spread of De Bragelonne's features a deadly
paleness, arising from the sudden surprise, and also from a vague
fear of impending misfortune.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My lord," he exclaimed, "you have
just pronounced words which compel me, without a moment's delay,
to seek their explanation in Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will remain here,"
said Buckingham, "because you have no right to leave; and no one
has the right to quit the service of the king for that of any
woman, even were she as worthy of being loved as Mary Grafton
is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You will tell me all,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will, on condition
that you will remain."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will
remain, if you will promise to speak openly and without
reserve."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Thus far had
their conversation proceeded, and Buckingham, in all probability,
was on the point of revealing, not indeed all that had taken
place, but at least all he was aware of, when one of the king's
attendants appeared at the end of the terrace, and advanced
towards the summer-house where the king was sitting with Lucy
Stewart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A courier
followed him, covered with dust from head to foot, and who seemed
as if he had but a few moments before dismounted from his
horse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The courier from
France!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame's
courier!" exclaimed Raoul, recognizing the princess's livery; and
while the attendant and the courier advanced towards the king,
Buckingham and Miss Grafton exchanged a look full of intelligence
with each other.</p>

C</span>harles II. was busily engaged in proving, or in
endeavoring to prove, to Miss Stewart that she was the only
person for whom he cared at all, and consequently was avowing to
her an affection similar to that which his ancestor Henry IV. had
entertained for Gabrielle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Unfortunately for Charles II., he
had hit upon an unlucky day, the very day Miss Stewart had taken
it into her head to make him jealous, and therefore, instead of
being touched by his offer, as the king had hoped, she laughed
heartily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire, sire," she
cried, laughing all the while; "if I were to be unfortunate
enough to ask you for a proof of the affection you possess, how
easy it would be to see that you are telling a falsehood."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nay, listen to me,"
said Charles, "you know my cartoons by Raphael; you know whether
I care for them or not; the whole world envies me their
possession, as you well know also; my father commissioned Van
Dyck to purchase them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Would you like me to send them to your house this very day?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no!" replied the
young girl; "pray keep them yourself, sire; my house is far too
small to accommodate such visitors."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

have Hampton Court to put the cartoons in."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

ask you."</p>

reason for being melancholy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

spoken quite enough, and quite highly enough, of Miss Grafton, to
overlook what I may have said about De Bragelonne.<span style=

for some time past astonishes me: you think of those who are
absent, you forgive those who have done you a wrong, in fact, you
are as nearly as possible, perfect.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How does it happen - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

yourself to be loved," he said, beginning to laugh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

other reason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

another reason."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, the true

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The duke is, indeed, a

everything to-day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

rapped at the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who is it who presumes
to interrupt us?" exclaimed Charles, impatiently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

extremely vain with your 'who is it who presumes?' and in order

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

opened it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is a courier from
France," said Miss Stewart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A courier from France!"
exclaimed Charles; "from my sister, perhaps?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire,"
said the usher, "a special messenger."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Let him
come in at once," said Charles.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have a letter for
me," said the king to the courier as he entered, "from the
Duchess of Orl&eacute;ans?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire,"
replied the courier, "and so urgent in its nature that I have
only been twenty-six hours in bringing it to your majesty, and
yet I lost three-quarters of an hour at Calais."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your zeal shall not be
forgotten," said the king, as he opened the letter.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When he had read it he burst out
laughing, and exclaimed, "Upon my word, I am at a loss to
understand anything about it."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then read the letter a second
time, Miss Stewart assuming a manner marked by the greatest
reserve, and doing her utmost to restrain her ardent
curiosity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Francis," said the king
to his valet, "see that this excellent fellow is well taken care

purse of fifty sovereigns by his bedside."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire!" said the
courier, amazed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Begone, begone; my
sister was perfectly right in desiring you to use the utmost
diligence; the affair was most pressing."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he again began to laugh louder
than ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The courier,
the valet, and Miss Stewart hardly knew what sort of countenance
to assume.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah!" said the
king, throwing himself back in his armchair: "When I think that
you have knocked up - how many horses?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Two!"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Two horses
to bring this intelligence to me.<span style=

now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The courier retired with
the valet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Charles went
to the window, which he opened, and leaning forward, called out -
"Duke!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Buckingham! come
here, there's a good fellow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The duke hurried to him,
in obedience to the summons; but when he reached the door, and
perceived Miss Stewart, he hesitated to enter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Come in, and shut the
door," said the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
duke obeyed; and, perceiving in what an excellent humor the king
was, he advanced, smiling, towards him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well, my dear duke, how do you get
on with your Frenchman?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire, I am in the most
perfect state of utter despair about him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because charming Miss
Grafton is willing to marry him, but he is unwilling."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, he is a perfect
B&oelig;otian!" cried Miss Stewart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Let him say either 'Yes,' or No,'
and let the affair end."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," said Buckingham,
seriously, "you know, or you ought to know, madame, that M. de
Bragelonne is in love in another direction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case," said the
king, coming to Miss Stewart's help, "nothing is easier; let him
say 'No,' then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very true; and I have
proved to him he was wrong not to say 'Yes.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You told him candidly,
I suppose, that La Valli&egrave;re was deceiving him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, without the
slightest reserve; and, as soon as I had done so, he gave a
start, as if he were going to clear the Channel at a bound."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At all events," said
Miss Stewart, "he has done something; and a very good thing too,
upon my word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," said Buckingham,
"I stopped him; I have left him and Miss Mary in conversation
together, and I sincerely trust that now he will not leave, as he
seemed to have an idea of doing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "An idea of leaving
England?" cried the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I, at one moment,
hardly thought that any human power could have prevented him; but
Miss Mary's eyes are now bent fully on him, and he will
remain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, that is the very
thing which deceives you, Buckingham," said the king, with a peal
of laughter; "the poor fellow is predestined."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Predestined to
what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If it were to be simply
deceived, that is nothing; but, to look at him, it is a great
deal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At a distance, and with
Miss Grafton's aid, the blow will be warded off."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Far from it, far from
it; neither distance nor Miss Grafton's help will be of the
slightest avail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Bragelonne will set off for Paris within an hour's time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Buckingham started, and
Miss Stewart opened her eyes very wide in astonishment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, sire," said the
duke, "your majesty knows that it is impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is to say, my dear
Buckingham, that it is impossible until it happens."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do not forget, sire,
that the young man is a perfect lion, and that his wrath is
terrible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I don't deny it, my
dear duke."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And that if he sees
that his misfortune is certain, so much the worse for the author
of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I don't deny it; but
what the deuce am I to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Were it the king
himself," cried Buckingham, "I would not answer for him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, the king has his
musketeers to take care of him," said Charles, quietly; "I know
that perfectly well, for I was kept dancing attendance in his
ante-chamber at Blois.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
has M. d'Artagnan, and what better guardian could the king have
than M. d'Artagnan?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
should make myself perfectly easy with twenty storms of passion,
such as Bragelonne might display, if I had four guardians like
D'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But I entreat your
majesty, who is so good and kind, to reflect a little."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Stay," said Charles
II., presenting the letter to the duke, "read, and answer
yourself what you would do in my place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Buckingham slowly took
hold of Madame's letter, and trembling with emotion, read the
following words:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For your own sake, for
mine, for the honor and safety of every one, send M. de
Bragelonne back to France immediately.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, Villiers, what do
you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Really, sire, I have
nothing to say," replied the duke, stupefied.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nay, would you, of all
persons," said the king, artfully, "advise me not to listen to my
sister when she writes so urgently?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, no, no, sire; and
yet - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have not read the
postscript, Villiers; it is under the fold of the letter, and
escaped me at first; read it."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And as the duke turned down a fold
of the letter, he read:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A thousand kind
remembrances to those who love me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The duke's head sank
gradually on his breast; the paper trembled in his fingers, as if
it had been changed to lead. <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king paused for a moment, and,
seeing that Buckingham did not speak, "He must follow his
destiny, as we ours," continued the king; "every man has his own
share of grief in this world; I have had my own, - I have had
that of others who belong to me, - and have thus had a double
weight of woe to endure! - But the deuce take all my cares
now!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Go, and bring our
friend here, Villiers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The duke opened the
trellised door of the summer-house, and pointing at Raoul and
Mary, who were walking together side by side, said, "What a cruel
blow, sire, for poor Miss Grafton!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nonsense; call him,"
said Charles II., knitting his black brows together; "every one
seems to be sentimental here.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There, look at Miss Stewart, who is
wiping her eyes, - now deuce take the French fellow!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The duke called to
Raoul, and taking Miss Grafton by the hand, he led her towards
the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur de
Bragelonne," said Charles II., "did you not ask me the day before
yesterday for permission to return to Paris?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire," replied
Raoul, greatly puzzled by this address.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I refused you, I
think?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For which
you were angry with me?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, sire;
your majesty had no doubt excellent reasons for withholding it;
for you are so wise and so good that everything you do is well
done."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I alleged,
I believe, as a reason, that the king of France had not recalled
you?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire,
that was the reason you assigned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, M. de Bragelonne,
I have reflected over the matter since; if the king did not, in
fact, fix your return, he begged me to render your sojourn in
England as agreeable as possible; since, however, you ask my
permission to return, it is because your longer residence in
England is no longer agreeable to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not say that,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, but your request,
at least," said the king, "signified that another place of
residence would be more agreeable to you than this."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> At this
moment Raoul turned towards the door, against which Miss Grafton
was leaning, pale and sorrow-stricken; her other hand was passed
through the duke's arm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do not reply,"
pursued Charles; "the proverb is plain enough, that 'silence
gives consent.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Very
good, Monsieur de Bragelonne; I am now in a position to satisfy
you; whenever you please, therefore, you can leave for Paris, for
which you have my authority."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Sire!" exclaimed Raoul,
while Mary stifled an exclamation of grief which rose to her
lips, unconsciously pressing Buckingham's arm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You can be at Dover
this evening," continued the king, "the tide serves at two
o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul, astounded,
stammered out a few broken sentences, which equally answered the
purpose both of thanks and of excuse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I therefore bid you
adieu, Monsieur de Bragelonne, and wish you every sort of
prosperity," said the king, rising; "you will confer a pleasure
on me by keeping this diamond in remembrance of me; I had
intended it as a marriage gift."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Miss Grafton felt her
limbs almost giving way; and, as Raoul received the ring from the
king's hand, he, too, felt his strength and courage failing
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He addressed a few
respectful words to the king, a passing compliment to Miss
Stewart, and looked for Buckingham to bid him adieu.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king profited by this moment to
disappear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul found
the duke engaged in endeavoring to encourage Miss Grafton.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Tell him to remain, I
implore you!" said Buckingham to Mary.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, I will tell him to
go," replied Miss Grafton, with returning animation; "I am not
one of those women who have more pride than heart; if she whom he
loves is in France, let him return thither and bless me for
having advised him to go and seek his happiness there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If, on the contrary, she shall
have ceased to love him, let him come back here again; I shall
still love him, and his unhappiness will not have lessened him in
my regard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the arms of

is accorded little, to the poor everything.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not believe,
Bragelonne, that you will find yonder the equivalent of what you
leave behind you here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I think, or at least
hope," said Raoul, with a gloomy air, "that she whom I love is
worthy of my affection; but if it be true she is unworthy of me,
as you have endeavored to make me believe, I will tear her image
from my heart, duke, even if my heart breaks in the attempt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mary Grafton gazed upon
him with an expression of the most indefinable pity, and Raoul
returned her look with a sweet, sorrowful smile, saying,
"Mademoiselle, the diamond which the king has given me was
destined for you, - give me leave to offer it for your
acceptance: if I marry in France, you will send it me back; if I
do not marry, keep it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
And he bowed and left her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What does he mean?"
thought Buckingham, while Raoul pressed Mary's icy hand with
marks of the most reverential respect.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Mary understood the look
that Buckingham fixed upon her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If it were a
wedding-ring, I would not accept it," she said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet you were
willing to ask him to return to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! duke," cried the
young girl in heart-broken accents, "a woman such as I am is
never accepted as a consolation by a man like him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You do not think he
will return, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Never," said Miss
Grafton, in a choking voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I grieve to tell
you, Mary, that he will find yonder his happiness destroyed, his
mistress lost to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His
honor even has not escaped.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What will be left him, then, Mary,
equal to your affection?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Answer, Mary, you who know yourself so well."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Miss Grafton
placed her white hand on Buckingham's arm, and, while Raoul was
hurrying away with headlong speed, she repeated in dying accents
the line from Romeo and Juliet:</p>

finished the last word, Raoul disappeared.<span style=

apartments, paler than death.<span style=

arrival of the courier, who had brought the letter to the king,
to write to Madame and to the Comte de Guiche.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king had not been mistaken, for
at two in the morning the tide was at full flood, and Raoul had
embarked for France.</p>

T</span>he king most assiduously followed the progress which was
made in La Valli&egrave;re's portrait; and did so with a care and
attention arising as much from a desire that it should resemble
her as from the wish that the painter should prolong the period
of its completion as much as possible.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was amusing to observe him follow
the artist's brush, awaiting the completion of a particular plan,
or the result of a combination of colors, and suggesting various
modifications to the painter, which the latter consented to adopt
with the most respectful docility.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And again, when the artist,
following Malicorne's advice, was a little late in arriving, and
when Saint-Aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time, it
was interesting to observe, though no one witnessed them, those
moments of silence full of deep expression, which united in one
sigh two souls most disposed to understand each other, and who by
no means objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed
together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The minutes
flew rapidly by, as if on wings, and as the king drew closer to
Louise and bent his burning gaze upon her, a noise was suddenly
heard in the ante-room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It was the artist, who had just arrived; Saint-Aignan, too, had
returned, full of apologies; and the king began to talk and La
Valli&egrave;re to answer him very hurriedly, their eyes
revealing to Saint-Aignan that they had enjoyed a century of
happiness during his absence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In a word, Malicorne, philosopher
that he was, though he knew it not, had learned how to inspire
the king with an appetite in the midst of plenty, and with desire
in the assurance of possession.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re's fears of
interruption had never been realized, and no one imagined she was
absent from her apartment two or three hours every day; she
pretended that her health was very uncertain; those who went to
her room always knocked before entering, and Malicorne, the man
of so many ingenious inventions, had constructed an acoustic
piece of mechanism, by means of which La Valli&egrave;re, when in
Saint-Aignan's apartment, was always forewarned of any visits
which were paid to the room she usually inhabited.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In this manner, therefore, without
leaving her room, and having no <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>confidante</i>, she was able to
return to her apartment, thus removing by her appearance, a
little tardy perhaps, the suspicions of the most determined
skeptics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Malicorne
having asked Saint-Aignan the next morning what news he had to
report, the latter was obliged to confess that the quarter of an
hour's liberty had made the king in most excellent humor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "We must double the dose,"
replied Malicorne, "but by insensible degrees; wait until they
seem to wish it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> They were so desirous
for it, however, that on the evening of the fourth day, at the
moment when the painter was packing up his implements, during
Saint-Aignan's continued absence, Saint-Aignan on his return
noticed upon La Valli&egrave;re's face a shade of disappointment
and vexation, which she could not conceal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king was less reserved, and
exhibited his annoyance by a very significant shrug of the
shoulders, at which La Valli&egrave;re could not help
blushing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Very good!"
thought Saint-Aignan to himself; "M. Malicorne will be delighted
this evening;" as he, in fact, was, when it was reported to
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is very evident," he
remarked to the comte, "that Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re
hoped that you would be at least ten minutes later."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the king that I
should be half an hour later, dear Monsieur Malicorne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You would show but very
indifferent devotion to the king," replied the latter, "if you
were to refuse his majesty that half-hour's satisfaction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the painter,"
objected Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i> will take care of him," said
Malicorne, "only I must study faces and circumstances a little
better before I act; those are my magical inventions and
contrivances; and while sorcerers are enabled by means of their
astrolabe to take the altitude of the sun, moon, and stars, I am
satisfied merely by looking into people's faces, in order to see
if their eyes are encircled with dark lines, and if the mouth
describes a convex or concave arc."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And the cunning
Malicorne had every opportunity of watching narrowly and closely,
for the very same evening the king accompanied the queen to
Madame's apartments, and made himself so remarked by his serious
face and his deep sigh, and looked at La Valli&egrave;re with
such a languishing expression, that Malicorne said to Montalais
during the evening: "To-morrow."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he went off to the painter's
house in the street of the Jardins Saint-Paul to request him to
postpone the next sitting for a couple of days.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan was not within, when La
Valli&egrave;re, who was now quite familiar with the lower story,
lifted up the trap-door and descended.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, as usual was waiting for
her on the staircase, and held a bouquet in his hand; as soon as
he saw her, he clasped her tenderly in his arms.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re, much moved at
the action, looked around the room, but as she saw the king was
alone, she did not complain of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They sat down, the king reclining
near the cushions on which Louise was seated, with his head
supported by her knees, placed there as in an asylum whence no
one could banish him; he gazed ardently upon her, and as if the
moment had arrived when nothing could interpose between their two
hearts; she, too, gazed with similar passion upon him, and from
her eyes, so softly pure, emanated a flame, whose rays first
kindled and then inflamed the heart of the king, who, trembling
with happiness as Louise's hand rested on his head, grew giddy
from excess of joy, and momentarily awaited either the painter's
or Saint-Aignan's return to break the sweet illusion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the door remained closed, and
neither Saint-Aignan nor the painter appeared, nor did the
hangings even move.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A
deep mysterious silence reigned in the room - a silence which
seemed to influence even the song-birds in their gilded
prisons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king,
completely overcome, turned round his head and buried his burning
lips in La Valli&egrave;re's hands, who, herself faint, with
excess of emotion, pressed her trembling hands against her
lover's lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis threw
himself upon his knees, and as La Valli&egrave;re did not move
her head, the king's forehead being within reach of her lips, she
furtively passed her lips across the perfumed locks which
caressed her cheeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king seized her in his arms, and, unable to resist the
temptation, they exchanged their first kiss, that burning kiss,
which changes love into delirium.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suddenly, a noise upon the upper
floor was heard, which had, in fact, continued, though it had
remained unnoticed, for some time; it had at last aroused La
Valli&egrave;re's attention, though but slowly so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As the noise, however, continued, as
it forced itself upon the attention, and recalled the poor girl
from her dreams of happiness to the sad realities of life, she
rose in a state of utter bewilderment, though beautiful in her
disorder, saying:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Some one is waiting for
me above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis, Louis,
do you not hear?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! and am I not
waiting for you, also?" said the king, with infinite tenderness
of tone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Let others
henceforth wait for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But she gently shook her
head, as she replied: "Happiness hidden&hellip; power
concealed&hellip; my pride should be as silent as my heart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The noise was again
resumed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I hear Montalais's
voice," she said, and she hurried up the staircase; the king
followed her, unable to let her leave his sight, and covering her
hand with his kisses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Yes, yes," repeated La Valli&egrave;re, who had passed half-way
through the opening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Yes, it is Montalais who is calling me; something important must
have happened."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Go then, dearest love,"
said the king, "but return quickly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no, not to-day,
sire!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Adieu! adieu!" she
said, as she stooped down once more to embrace her lover - and
escaped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais was,
in fact, waiting for her, very pale and agitated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Quick, quick! <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he</i> is coming," she said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who - who is
coming?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Raoul,"
murmured Montalais.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is I - I," said a
joyous voice, upon the last steps of the grand staircase.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re
uttered a terrible shriek and threw herself back.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am here, dear
Louise," said Raoul, running towards her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I knew but too well that you had
not ceased to love me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> La Valli&egrave;re with
a gesture, partly of extreme terror, and partly as if invoking a
blessing, attempted to speak, but could not articulate one
word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No, no!" she said,
as she fell into Montalais's arms, murmuring, "Do not touch me,
do not come near me."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Montalais
made a sign to Raoul, who stood almost petrified at the door, and
did not even attempt to advance another step into the room.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, looking towards the side
of the room where the screen was, she exclaimed: "Imprudent girl,
she has not even closed the trap-door."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And she advanced towards
the corner of the room to close the screen, and also, behind the
screen, the trap-door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But suddenly the king, who had heard Louise's exclamation, darted
through the opening, and hurried forward to her assistance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He threw himself on his knees
before her, as he overwhelmed Montalais with questions, who
hardly knew where she was.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the moment, however, when the
king threw himself on his knees, a cry of utter despair rang
through the corridor, accompanied by the sound of retreating
footsteps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king
wished to see who had uttered the cry and whose were the
footsteps he had heard; and it was in vain that Montalais sought
to retain him, for Louis, quitting his hold of La
Valli&egrave;re, hurried towards the door, too late, however, for
Raoul was already at a distance, and the king only beheld a
shadow that quickly vanished in the silent corridor.</p>

W</span>hilst every one at court was busily engaged with his own
affairs, a man mysteriously took up his post behind the Place de
Gr&egrave;ve, in the house which we once saw besieged by
D'Artagnan on the occasion of the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&eacute;meute</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The principal entrance of the house
was in the Place Baudoyer; it was tolerably large, surrounded by
gardens, inclosed in the Rue Saint-Jean by the shops of
toolmakers, which protected it from prying looks, and was walled
in by a triple rampart of stone, noise, and verdure, like an
embalmed mummy in its triple coffin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The man we have just alluded to
walked along with a firm step, although he was no longer in his
early prime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His dark
cloak and long sword plainly revealed one who seemed in search of
adventures; and, judging from his curling mustache, his fine
smooth skin, which could be seen beneath his <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sombrero</i>, it would not have been
difficult to pronounce that gallantry had not a little share in
his adventures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact,
hardly had the cavalier entered the house, when the clock struck
eight; and ten minutes afterwards a lady, followed by a servant
armed to the teeth, approached and knocked at the same door,
which an old woman immediately opened for her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The lady raised her veil as she
entered; though no longer beautiful or young, she was still
active and of an imposing carriage.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She concealed, beneath a rich
toilette and the most exquisite taste, an age which Ninon de
l'Enclos alone could have smiled at with impunity.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hardly had she reached the
vestibule, when the cavalier, whose features we have only roughly
sketched, advanced towards her, holding out his hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "God day, my dear
duchesse," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How do you do, my dear
Aramis?" replied the duchesse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He led her to a most
elegantly furnished apartment, on whose high windows were
reflected the expiring rays of the setting sun, which filtered
gaudily through the dark green needles of the adjacent firs.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They sat down side by
side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Neither of them
thought of asking for additional light in the room, and they
buried themselves as it were in the shadow, as if they wished to
bury themselves in forgetfulness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Chevalier," said the
duchesse, "you have never given me a single sign of life since
our interview at Fontainebleau, and I confess that your presence
there on the day of the Franciscan's death, and your initiation
in certain secrets, caused me the liveliest astonishment I ever
experienced in my whole life."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I can explain my
presence there to you, as well as my initiation," said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But let us, first of
all," said the duchess, "talk a little of ourselves, for our
friendship is by no means of recent date."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, madame: and if
Heaven wills it, we shall continue to be friends, I will not say
for a long time, but forever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is quite certain,
chevalier, and my visit is a proof of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Our interests, duchess,
are no longer the same as they used to be," said Aramis, smiling
without apprehension in the growing gloom by which the room was
overcast, for it could not reveal that his smile was less
agreeable and not so bright as formerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, chevalier, at the
present day we have other interests.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Every period of life brings its own;
and, as we now understand each other in conversing, as perfectly
as we formerly did without saying a word, let us talk, if you
like."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am at your orders,
duchesse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I beg your pardon, how did you
obtain my address, and what was your object?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You ask me why?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have told you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Curiosity in the first place.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I wished to know what you
could have to do with the Franciscan, with whom I had certain
business transactions, and who died so singularly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know that on the occasion of our
interview at Fontainebleau, in the cemetery, at the foot of the
grave so recently closed, we were both so much overcome by our
emotions that we omitted to confide to each other what we may
have to say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, I had no
sooner left you than I repented, and have ever since been most
anxious to ascertain the truth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know that Madame de Longueville
and myself are almost one, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was not aware," said
Aramis, discreetly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I remembered,
therefore," continued the duchesse, "that neither of us said
anything to the other in the cemetery; that you did not speak of
the relationship in which you stood to the Franciscan, whose
burial you superintended, and that I did not refer to the
position in which I stood to him; all which seemed very unworthy
of two such old friends as ourselves, and I have sought an
opportunity of an interview with you in order to give you some
information that I have recently acquired, and to assure you that
Marie Michon, now no more, has left behind her one who has
preserved her recollection of events."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis bowed over the
duchess's hand, and pressed his lips upon it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You must have had some trouble to
find me again," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," she answered,
annoyed to find the subject taking a turn which Aramis wished to
give it; "but I knew you were a friend of M. Fouquet's, and so I
inquired in that direction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A friend! oh!"
exclaimed the chevalier, "I can hardly pretend to be <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A poor priest who has been favored
by a generous protector, and whose heart is full of gratitude and
devotion, is all that I pretend to be to M. Fouquet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He made you a
bishop?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A very good retiring
pension for so handsome a musketeer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; in the same way
that political intrigue is for yourself," thought Aramis.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And so," he added, "you
inquired after me at M. Fouquet's?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Easily enough.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You had been to Fontainebleau
with him, and had undertaken a voyage to your diocese, which is
Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer, I believe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, madame," said
Aramis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My diocese is
Vannes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I meant that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I only thought that
Belle-&Icirc;le-en-Mer - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is a property belonging
to M. Fouquet, nothing more."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had been told that Belle-Isle was
fortified; besides, I know how great the military knowledge is
you possess."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have forgotten
everything of the kind since I entered the Church," said Aramis,
annoyed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Suffice it to know that
I learned you had returned from Vannes, and I sent off to one of
our friends, M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re, who is discretion
itself, in order to ascertain it, but he answered that he was not
aware of your address."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So like Athos," thought
the bishop; "the really good man never changes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then, you know
that I cannot venture to show myself here, and that the
queen-mother has always some grievance or other against me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, indeed, and I am
surprised at it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! there are various
reasons for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, to
continue, being obliged to conceal myself, I was fortunate enough
to meet with M. d'Artagnan, who was formerly one of your old
friends, I believe?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A friend of mine still,
duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He gave me certain
information, and sent me to M. Baisemeaux, the governor of the
Bastile."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis was somewhat
agitated at this remark, and a light flashed from his eyes in the
darkness of the room, which he could not conceal from his
keen-sighted friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "M.
de Baisemeaux!" he said, "why did D'Artagnan send you to M. de
Baisemeaux?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I cannot
tell you."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What can
this possibly mean?" said the bishop, summoning all the resources
of his mind to his aid, in order to carry on the combat in a
befitting manner.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. de Baisemeaux is
greatly indebted to you, D'Artagnan told me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

creditor is as easily ascertained as that of a debtor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Baisemeaux indicated to you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

hand, and which is most precious to me," said Aramis, "because I
am indebted to it for the pleasure of seeing you here."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The duchesse, satisfied at
having successfully overcome the various difficulties of so
delicate an explanation, began to breathe freely again, which
Aramis, however, could not succeed in doing.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "We had got as far as your visit to
M. Baisemeaux, I believe?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nay," she
said, laughing, "farther than that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case we must
have been speaking about the grudge you have against the
queen-mother."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Further still," she
returned, "further still; we were talking of the connection -

you and the Franciscan," said Aramis, interrupting her eagerly,
"well, I am listening to you very attentively."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

explained," returned the duchesse.<span style=

Brussels with M. de Laicques?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

obliged me to resort to some means of obtaining a livelihood,
and, particularly, to avoid vegetating for the remainder of my
existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I had old
hatreds to turn to account, old friendships to make use of; I no

indeed?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Were you

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

was inattentive."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Jesuits, you mean?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span>
"Exactly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, then, I
have seen the king of Spain, who wished me to do a service, but
was unable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He gave me
recommendations, however, to Flanders, both for myself and for
Laicques too; and conferred a pension on me out of the funds
belonging to the order."</p>

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes.<span

Franciscan - was sent to me; and, for the purpose of conforming
with the requisitions of the statues of the order, and of
entitling me to the pension, I was reputed to be in a position to
render certain services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You are aware that that is the rule?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, I did not know it,"
said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

paused to look at Aramis, but it was perfectly dark.<span style=

she resumed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I had,
therefore, to appear to possess a power of usefulness of some
kind or other, and I proposed to travel for the order, and I was
placed on the list of affiliated travelers.<span style=

convenient for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And can the
queen-mother know and see all that, without shedding a tear?"

thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I came to
Fontainebleau with a double object in view.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the first place, I was summoned
there by the Franciscan whom you knew.<span style=

for I have told you my story, and have not yet heard yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I knew him in a very
natural way, duchesse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
studied theology with him at Parma.<span style=

happened, from time to time, that business, or travel, or war,
separated us from each other."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You were, of course,
aware that he was the general of the Jesuits?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But by what
extraordinary chance did it happen that you were at the hotel
when the affiliated travelers met together?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!" said Aramis, in a
calm voice, "it was the merest chance in the world.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was going to Fontainebleau to see
M. Fouquet, for the purpose of obtaining an audience of the
king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was passing by,
unknown; I saw the poor dying monk in the road, and recognized
him immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know
the rest - he died in my arms."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes; but bequeathing to

me a few commissions to settle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have told
you - a sum of twelve thousand livres was to be paid to you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I thought I had given you the
necessary signature to enable you to receive it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Did you not get the money?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! yes,
yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You give your
orders, I am informed, with so much mystery, and such a majestic
presence, that it is generally believed you are the successor of
the defunct chief."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis colored
impatiently, and the duchesse continued: "I have obtained my
information," she said, "from the king of Spain himself; and he
cleared up some of my doubts on the point.<span style=

nominated by him, and must be a Spaniard, according to the
statutes of the order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You are not a Spaniard, nor have you been nominated by the king
of Spain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis did not reply to
this remark, except to say, "You see, duchesse, how greatly you
were mistaken, since the king of Spain told you that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, my dear Aramis;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know, I believe,
something about most things, and it occurred to me that you know
the Spanish language."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Every Frenchman who has
been actively engaged in the Fronde knows Spanish."</p>

Flanders?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Three

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And have
stayed at Madrid?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are in a position,
then, to become a naturalized Spaniard, when you like."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Really?" said Aramis,
with a frankness which deceived the duchesse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Undoubtedly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Two years' residence and an
acquaintance with the language are indispensable.<span style=

more than double the time necessary."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

at, duchesse?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

terms with the king of Spain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

terms," thought Aramis to himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Shall I ask the king,"
continued the duchesse, "to confer the succession to the
Franciscan's post upon you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

render you that service."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the same service to M. de Laicques, duchesse?<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, no doubt; but, at

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She
paused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "He is

me in this manner, it is not very encouraging for me, supposing I
should have something to ask of you."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! ask,
pray, ask."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I need a

coldly - "money?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well,
duchesse, how much would you require?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! a tolerably round

am not the general, I think."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that

did not believe it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why, duchesse?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because I have, or
rather Laicques has, certain letters in his possession from
Cardinal Mazarin, which establish the existence of very strange
accounts."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What
accounts?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Relative to various
sums of money borrowed and disposed of.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I cannot very distinctly remember
what they are; but they establish the fact that the
superintendent, according to these letters, which are signed by
Mazarin, had taken thirteen millions of francs from the coffers
of the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The case is
a very serious one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Aramis clenched his
hands in anxiety and apprehension.<span style=

have such letters as you speak of, and have not communicated them
to M. Fouquet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

duchesse, "I keep such trifling matters as these in reserve.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The day may come when they
will be of service; and they can be withdrawn from the safe
custody in which they now remain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And that day has
arrived?" said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I prefer to
talk about them with you, instead."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You must be
in sad want of money, my poor friend, to think of such things as
these - you, too, who held M. de Mazarin's prose effusions in
such indifferent esteem."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

continued Aramis, in cold accents, "it must have been very

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! if had wished to do
harm instead of good," said Madame de Chevreuse, "instead of
asking the general of the order, or M. Fouquet, for the five

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

instead of asking for this amount, I should have gone to see my
old friend the queen-mother; the letters from her husband, Signor

have begged this mere trifle of her, saying to her, 'I wish,
madame, to have the honor of receiving you at Dampierre.<span

a fit state for that purpose.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

additions," said Aramis.</p>

subtractions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I, on the

opening between people like ourselves, 'yes' or 'no' is the only
answer, and that an immediate one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, madame, I should
be very much astonished if M. Fouquet had five hundred thousand
francs at his disposal at the present moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is no use speaking
of it, then," said the duchesse, "and Dampierre must get restored
how best it may."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! you are not
embarrassed to such an extent as that, I suppose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

embarrassed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And the queen,"
continued the bishop, "will certainly do for you what the
superintendent is unable to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!
certainly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But tell me,
do you think it would be better that I should speak, myself, to
M. Fouquet about these letters?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nay, duchesse, you
will do precisely whatever you please in that respect.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Fouquet either feels or
does not feel himself to be guilty; if he really be so, I know he
is proud enough not to confess it; if he be not so, he will be
exceedingly offended at your menace."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As usual, you
reason like an angel," said the duchesse, as she rose from her
seat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And so, you are
now going to denounce M. Fouquet to the queen," said Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Denounce!'<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! what a disagreeable
word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall not
'denounce' my dear friend; you know matters of policy too well to
be ignorant how easily these affairs are arranged.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall merely side against M.
Fouquet, and nothing more; and, in a war of party against party,
a weapon is always a weapon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No doubt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And once on
friendly terms again with the queen-mother, I may be dangerous
towards some persons."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are at liberty
to prove so, duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A liberty of which
I shall avail myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are not
ignorant, I suppose, duchesse, that M. Fouquet is on the best
terms with the king of Spain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I suppose so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If, therefore, you
begin a party warfare against M. Fouquet, he will reply in the
same way; for he, too, is at perfect liberty to do so, is he
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!
certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And as he is on
good terms with Spain, he will make use of that friendship as a
weapon of attack."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You mean, that he
is, naturally, on good terms with the general of the order of the
Jesuits, my dear Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That may be the
case, duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And that,
consequently, the pension I have been receiving from the order
will be stopped."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am greatly
afraid it might be."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well; I must
contrive to console myself in the best way I can; for after
Richelieu, after the Fronde, after exile, what is there left for
Madame de Chevreuse to be afraid of?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The pension, you
are aware, is forty-eight thousand francs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Alas!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am quite aware of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Moreover, in party
contests, you know, the friends of one's enemy do not
escape."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Ah! you mean that
poor Laicques will have to suffer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"I am afraid it is
almost inevitable, duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Oh! he only
receives twelve thousand francs pension."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, but the king
of Spain has some influence left; advised by M. Fouquet, he might
get M. Laicques shut up in prison for a little while."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am not very
nervous on that point, my dear friend; because, once reconciled
with Anne of Austria, I will undertake that France would insist
upon M. Laicques's liberation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"True.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In that case, you will have
something else to apprehend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What can that be?"
said the duchesse, pretending to be surprised and terrified.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will learn;
indeed, you must know it already, that having once been an
affiliated member of the order, it is not easy to leave it; for
the secrets that any particular member may have acquired are
unwholesome, and carry with them the germs of misfortune for
whosoever may reveal them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The duchesse paused
and reflected for a moment, and then said, "That is more serious:
I will think it over."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And notwithstanding
the profound obscurity, Aramis seemed to feel a basilisk glance,
like a white-hot iron, escape from his friend's eyes, and plunge
into his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let us
recapitulate," said Aramis, determined to keep himself on his
guard, and gliding his hand into his breast where he had a dagger
concealed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly, let us
recapitulate; short accounts make long friends."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The suppression of
your pension - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Forty-eight
thousand francs, and that of Laicques's twelve, make together
sixty thousand francs; that is what you mean, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Precisely; and I
was trying to find out what would be your equivalent for
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Five hundred
thousand francs, which I shall get from the queen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Or, which you will
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> get."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I know a means of
procuring them," said the duchesse, thoughtlessly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>This remark made
the chevalier prick up his ears; and from the moment his
adversary had committed this error, his mind was so thoroughly on
its guard, that he seemed every moment to gain the advantage more
and more; and she, consequently, to lose it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I will admit, for argument's sake,
that you obtain the money," he resumed; "you will lose twice as
much, having a hundred thousand francs' pension to receive
instead of sixty thousand, and that for a<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> period of ten years."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not so, for I
shall only be subjected to this reduction of my income during the
period of M. Fouquet's remaining in power, a period which I
estimate at two months."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!" said
Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am frank, you
see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I thank you for
it, duchesse; but you would be wrong to suppose that after M.
Fouquet's disgrace the order would resume the payment of your
pension."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I know a means of
making the order pay, as I know a means of forcing the
queen-mother to concede what I require."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In that case,
duchesse, we are all obliged to strike our flags to you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The victory is yours, and the
triumph also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Be clement,
I entreat you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But is it
possible," resumed the duchesse, without taking notice of the
irony, "that you really draw back from a miserable sum of five
hundred thousand francs, when it is a question of sparing you - I
mean your friend - I beg your pardon, I ought rather to say your
protector - the disagreeable consequences which a party contest
produces?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Duchesse, I tell
you why; supposing the five hundred thousand francs were to be
given you, M. Laicques will require his share, which will be
another five hundred thousand francs, I presume? and then, after
M. de Laicques's and your own portions have been arranged, the
portions which your children, your poor pensioners, and various
other persons will require, will start up as fresh claims, and
these letters, however compromising they may be in their nature,
are not worth from three to four millions.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Can you have forgotten the queen of
France's diamonds? - they were surely worth more than these bits
of waste paper signed by Mazarin, and yet their recovery did not
cost a fourth part of what you ask for yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, that is true;
but the merchant values his goods at his own price, and it is for
the purchaser to buy or refuse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Stay a moment,
duchesse; would you like me to tell you why I will not buy your
letters?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Pray tell me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because the
letters you claim to be Mazarin's are false."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What an
absurdity."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have no doubt of
it, for it would, to say the least, be very singular, that after
you had quarreled with the queen through M. Mazarin's means, you
should have kept up any intimate acquaintance with the latter; it
would look as if you had been acting as a spy; and upon my word,
I do not like to make use of the word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! pray do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You great
complacence would seem suspicions, at all events."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is quite
true; but the contents of the letters are even more so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I pledge you my
word, duchesse, that you will not be able to make use of it with
the queen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! yes, indeed; I
can make use of everything with the queen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good,"
thought Aramis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Croak
on, old owl - hiss, beldame-viper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>But the duchesse
had said enough, and advanced a few steps towards the door.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis, however, had reserved
one exposure which she did <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> expect.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>He rang the bell,
candles immediately appeared in the adjoining room, and the
bishop found himself completely encircled by lights, which shone
upon the worn, haggard face of the duchesse, revealing every
feature but too clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Aramis fixed a long ironical look upon her pale, thin, withered
cheeks - her dim, dull eyes - and upon her lips, which she kept
carefully closed over her discolored scanty teeth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He, however, had thrown himself into
a graceful attitude, with his haughty and intelligent head thrown
back; he smiled so as to reveal teeth still brilliant and
dazzling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The antiquated
coquette understood the trick that had been played her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was standing immediately
before a large mirror, in which her decrepitude, so carefully
concealed, was only made more manifest.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, thereupon, without even
saluting Aramis, who bowed with the ease and grace of the
musketeer of early days, she hurried away with trembling steps,
which her very precipitation only the more impeded.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis sprang across the room, like
a zephyr, to lead her to the door.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame de Chevreuse made a sign to
her servant, who resumed his musket, and she left the house where
such tender friends had not been able to understand each other
only because they had understood each other too well.</p>

A</span>ramis had been perfectly correct in his supposition; for
hardly had she left the house in the Place Baudoyer than Madame
de Chevreuse proceeded homeward.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was doubtless afraid of being
followed, and by this means thought she might succeed in throwing
those who might be following her off their guard; but scarcely
had she arrived within the door of the hotel, and hardly had
assured herself that no one who could cause her any uneasiness
was on her track, when she opened the door of the garden, leading
into another street, and hurried towards the Rue Croix des
Petits-Champs, where M. Colbert resided.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> We have already said
that evening, or rather night, had closed in; it was a dark,
thick night, besides; Paris had once more sunk into its calm,
quiescent state, enshrouding alike within its indulgent mantle
the high-born duchesse carrying out her political intrigue, and
the simple citizen's wife, who, having been detained late by a
supper in the city, was making her way slowly homewards, hanging
on the arm of a lover, by the shortest possible route.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame de Chevreuse had been
too well accustomed to nocturnal political intrigues to be
ignorant that a minister never denies himself, even at his own
private residence, to any young and beautiful woman who may
chance to object to the dust and confusion of a public office, or
to old women, as full of experience as of years, who dislike the
indiscreet echo of official residences.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A valet received the duchesse under
the peristyle, and received her, it must be admitted, with some
indifference of manner; he intimated, after having looked at her
face, that it was hardly at such an hour that one so advanced in
years as herself could be permitted to disturb Monsieur Colbert's
important occupations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But Madame de Chevreuse, without looking or appearing to be
annoyed, wrote her name upon a leaf of her tablets - a name which
had but too frequently sounded so disagreeably in the ears of
Louis XIII. and of the great cardinal.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She wrote her name in the large,
ill-formed characters of the higher classes of that period,
handed it to the valet, without uttering a word, but with so
haughty and imperious a gesture, that the fellow, well accustomed
to judge of people from their manners and appearance, perceived
at once the quality of the person before him, bowed his head, and
ran to M. Colbert's room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The minister could not control a sudden exclamation as he opened
the paper; and the valet, gathering from it the interest with
which his master regarded the mysterious visitor, returned as
fast as he could to beg the duchesse to follow him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She ascended to the first floor of
the beautiful new house very slowly, rested herself on the
landing-place, in order not to enter the apartment out of breath,
and appeared before M. Colbert, who, with his own hands, held
both the folding doors open.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The duchesse paused at the
threshold, for the purpose of well studying the character of the
man with whom she was about to converse.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the first glance, the round,
large, heavy head, thick brows, and ill-favored features of
Colbert, who wore, thrust low down on his head, a cap like a
priest's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>calotte</i>,
seemed to indicate that but little difficulty was likely to be
met with in her negotiations with him, but also that she was to
expect as little interest in the discussion of particulars; for
there was scarcely any indication that the rough and uncouth
nature of the man was susceptible to the impulses of a refined
revenge, or of an exalted ambition.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But when, on closer inspection, the
duchesse perceived the small, piercingly black eyes, the
longitudinal wrinkles of his high and massive forehead, the
imperceptible twitching of the lips, on which were apparent
traces of rough good-humor, Madame de Chevreuse altered her
opinion of him, and felt she could say to herself: "I have found
the man I want."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is the subject,
madame, which procures me the honor of a visit from you?" he
inquired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

you, monsieur," returned the duchesse, "as well as that which you
have of me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

with the first portion of your sentence; but, as far as the
second portion is concerned - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame de Chevreuse sat
down in the armchair which M. Colbert advanced towards her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur Colbert, you are the
intendant of finances, and are ambitious of becoming the
superintendent?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

however well-disposed and inclined to show politeness I may be

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I said nothing about
supplanting, Monsieur Colbert.<span style=

think that likely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
word 'replace' is less aggressive in its signification, and more
grammatically suitable, as M. de Voiture would say.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said by M. Conrart, a member of the academy, I believe, that when
the Colossus of Rhodes fell from its lofty position, the merchant
who had cast it down - a merchant, nothing more, M. Colbert -
loaded four hundred camels with the ruins.<span style=

you have to do with a woman who has had political dealings with
the Cardinal Richelieu, and who has no time to lose; as, I
repeat, you do not hesitate to commit such an imprudence, I shall
go and find others who are more intelligent and more desirous of
making their fortunes."</p>

a man of a very high order of intellect, and had said to him

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Forgive me, madame
la duchesse, but it is almost impossible that M. Fouquet can be
exiled; to be imprisoned or disgraced, that is already a great
deal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, I am perfectly
aware of what I am saying," returned Madame de Chevreuse,
coldly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I do not live at
such a distance from Paris as not to know what takes place
there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king does not
like M. Fouquet, and he would willingly sacrifice M. Fouquet if
an opportunity were only given him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It must be a good
one, though."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Good enough, and
one I estimate to be worth five hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In what way?" said
Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I mean, monsieur,
that holding this opportunity in my own hands, I will not allow
it to be transferred to yours except for a sum of five hundred
thousand francs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I understand you
perfectly, madame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
since you have fixed a price for the sale, let me now see the
value of the articles to be sold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, a mere trifle;
six letters, as I have already told you, from M. de Mazarin; and
the autographs will most assuredly not be regarded as too highly
priced, if they establish, in an irrefutable manner, that M.
Fouquet has embezzled large sums of money from the treasury and
appropriated them to his own purposes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In an irrefutable
manner, do you say?" observed Colbert, whose eyes sparkled with
delight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Perfectly so;
would you like to read the letters?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"With all my
heart!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Copies, of
course?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of course, the
copies," said the duchesse, as she drew from her bosom a small
packet of papers flattened by her velvet bodice.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Read," she said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert eagerly
snatched the papers and devoured them.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Excellent!" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is clear
enough, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, madame, yes;
M. Mazarin must have handed the money to M. Fouquet, who must
have kept it for his own purposes; but the question is, what
money?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly, - what
money; if we come to terms I will join to these six letters a
seventh, which will supply you with the fullest particulars."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert
reflected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And the
originals of these letters?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A useless question
to ask; exactly as if I were to ask you, Monsieur Colbert,
whether the money-bags you will give me will be full or
empty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good,
madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Is it
concluded?"<br>
"No; for there is one circumstance to which neither of us has
given any attention."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Name it!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"M. Fouquet can be
utterly ruined, under the legal circumstances you have detailed,
only by means of legal proceedings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A public scandal,
for instance; and yet neither the legal proceedings nor the
scandal can be commenced against him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because he is
procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral of the parliament; because, too,
in France, all public administrators, the army, justice itself,
and commerce, are intimately connected by ties of
good-fellowship, which people call <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>espirit de corps</i>.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In such a case, madame, the
parliament will never permit its chief to be dragged before a
public tribunal; and never, even if he be dragged there by royal
authority, never, I say, will he be condemned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, Monsieur
Colbert, I do not see what I have to do with that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am aware of
that, madame; but I have to do with it, and it consequently
diminishes the value of what you have brought to show me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What good can a proof of a
crime be to me, without the possibility of obtaining a
condemnation?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Even if he be only
suspected, M. Fouquet will lose his post of superintendent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Is that all?"
exclaimed Colbert, whose dark, gloomy features were momentarily
lighted up by an expression of hate and vengeance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! ah!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur Colbert," said the
duchesse, "forgive me, but I did not think you were so
impressionable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Very
good; in that case, since you need more than I have to give you,
there is no occasion to speak of the matter at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, madame, we
will go on talking of it; only, as the value of your commodities
had decreased, you must lower your pretensions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are
bargaining, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Every man who
wishes to deal loyally is obliged to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How much will you
offer me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Two hundred
thousand francs," said Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The duchesse
laughed in his face, and then said, suddenly, "Wait a moment, I
have another arrangement to propose; will you give me three
hundred thousand francs?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, no."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, you can either
accept or refuse my terms; besides, that is not all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"More still! you
are becoming too impracticable to deal with, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Less so than you
think, perhaps, for it is not money I am going to ask you
for."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is it,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A service; you
know that I have always been most affectionately attached to the
queen, and I am desirous of having an interview with her
majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"With the
queen?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, Monsieur
Colbert, with the queen, who is, I admit, no longer my friend,
and who has ceased to be so for a long time past, but who may
again become so if the opportunity be only given her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Her majesty has
ceased to receive any one, madame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She is a great sufferer, and you may
be aware that the paroxysms of her disease occur with greater
frequency than ever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is the very
reason why I wish to have an interview with her majesty; for in
Flanders there is a great variety of these kinds of
complaints."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What, cancers - a
fearful, incurable disorder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do not believe
that, Monsieur Colbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The Flemish peasant is somewhat a man of nature, and his
companion for life is not alone a wife, but a female laborer
also; for while he is smoking his pipe, the woman works: it is
she who draws the water from the well; she who loads the mule or
the ass, and even bears herself a portion of the burden.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Taking but little care of
herself, she gets knocked about first in one direction, and then
in another, and very often is beaten by her husband, and cancers
frequently rise from contusions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"True, true," said
Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The Flemish women
do not die the sooner on that account.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When they are great sufferers from
this disease they go in search of remedies, and the
B&eacute;guines of Bruges are excellent doctors for every kind of
disease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They have
precious waters of one sort or another; specifics of various
kinds; and they give a bottle of it and a wax candle to the
sufferer, whereby the priests are gainers, and Heaven is served
by the disposal of both their wares.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will take the queen some of this
holy water, which I will procure from the B&eacute;guines of
Bruges; her majesty will recover, and will burn as many wax
candles as she may see fit.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You see, Monsieur Colbert, to
prevent my seeing the queen is almost as bad as committing the
crime of regicide."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are
undoubtedly, madame la duchesse, a woman of exceedingly great
abilities, and I am more than astounded at their display; still I
cannot but suppose that this charitable consideration towards the
queen in some measure covers a slight personal interest for
yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have not given
myself the trouble to conceal it, that I am aware of, Monsieur
Colbert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You said, I
believe, that I had a slight personal interest?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the contrary, it is a very great
interest, and I will prove it to you, by resuming what I was
saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you procure me
a personal interview with her majesty, I will be satisfied with
the three hundred thousand francs I have claimed; if not, I shall
keep my letters, unless, indeed, you give me, on the spot, five
hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And rising from her
seat with this decisive remark, the old duchesse plunged M.
Colbert into a disagreeable perplexity.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To bargain any further was out of
the question; and not to bargain was to pay a great deal too
dearly for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Madame," he said, "I shall have the pleasure of handing over a
hundred thousand crowns; but how shall I get the actual letters
themselves?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In the simplest
manner in the world, my dear Monsieur Colbert - whom will you
trust?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The financier began
to laugh, silently, so that his large eyebrows went up and down
like the wings of a bat, upon the deep lines of his yellow
forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No one," he
said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You surely will
make an exception in your own favor, Monsieur Colbert?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In what way,
madame?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I mean that, if
you would take the trouble to accompany me to the place where the
letters are, they would be delivered into your own hands, and you
would be able to verify and check them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quite true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You would bring
the hundred thousand crowns with you at the same time, for I,
too, do not trust any one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert colored to
the tips of his ears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Like all eminent men in the art of figures, he was of an insolent
and mathematical probity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"I will take with me, madame," he said, "two orders for the
amount agreed upon, payable at my treasury.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will that satisfy you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Would that the
orders on your treasury were for two millions, monsieur
l'intendant!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall have
the pleasure of showing you the way, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Allow me to order
my carriage?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have a carriage
below, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert coughed
like an irresolute man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He imagined, for a moment, that the proposition of the duchesse
was a snare; that perhaps some one was waiting at the door; and
that she whose secret had just been sold to Colbert for a hundred
thousand crowns, had already offered it to Fouquet for the same
sum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As he still
hesitated, the duchesse looked at him full in the face.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You prefer your
own carriage?" she said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I admit I <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You suppose I am
going to lead you into a snare or trap of some sort or
other?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Madame la
duchesse, you have the character of being somewhat inconsiderate
at times, as I am reputed a sober, solemn character, a jest or
practical joke might compromise me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; the fact is,
you are afraid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well,
then, take your own carriage, as many servants as you like, only
think well of what I am going to say.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What we two may arrange between
ourselves, we are the only persons who will know - if a third
person is present we might as well tell the whole world about
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After all, I do not
make a point of it; my carriage shall follow yours, and I shall
be satisfied to accompany you in your own carriage to the
queen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To the queen?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you forgotten
that already?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it
possible that one of the clauses of the agreement of so much
importance to me, can have escaped you so soon?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How trifling it seems to you,
indeed; if I had known it I should have asked double what I have
done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have reflected,
madame, and I shall not accompany you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Really - and why
not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because I have the
most perfect confidence in you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You overpower
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But - provided I
receive the hundred thousand crowns?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Here they are,
madame," said Colbert, scribbling a few lines on a piece of
paper, which he handed to the duchesse, adding, "You are
paid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The trait is a
fine one, Monsieur Colbert, and I will reward you for it," she
said, beginning to laugh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Madame de
Chevreuse's laugh was a very sinister sound; a man with youth,
faith, love, life itself, throbbing in his heart, would prefer a
sob to such a lamentable laugh.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The duchesse opened the front of her
dress and drew forth from her bosom, somewhat less white than it
once had been, a small packet of papers, tied with a
flame-colored ribbon, and, still laughing, she said, "There,
Monsieur Colbert, are the originals of Cardinal Mazarin's
letters; they are now your own property," she added, refastening
the body of her dress; "your fortune is secured.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And now accompany me to the
queen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, madame; if you
are again about to run the chance of her majesty's displeasure,
and it were known at the Palais Royal that I had been the means
of introducing you there, the queen would never forgive me while
she lived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No; there are
certain persons at the palace who are devoted to me, who will
procure you an admission without my being compromised."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Just as you
please, provided I enter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you term
those religions women at Bruges who cure disorders?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>

one?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As you please, -
but I must soon cease to be one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is your
affair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Excuse me, but I
do not wish to be exposed to a refusal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is again your
own affair, madame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am

C</span>olbert handed the duchesse the letter, and gently drew
aside the chair behind which she was standing; Madame de
Chevreuse, with a very slight bow, immediately left the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert, who had
recognized Mazarin's handwriting, and had counted the letters,
rang to summon his secretary, whom he enjoined to go in immediate
search of M. Vanel, a counselor of the parliament.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The secretary replied that,
according to his usual practice, M. Vanel had just that moment
entered the house, in order to give the intendant an account of
the principal details of the business which had been transacted
during the day in parliament.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert approached one of the lamps,
read the letters of the deceased cardinal over again, smiled
repeatedly as he recognized the great value of the papers Madame
de Chevreuse had just delivered - and burying his head in his
hands for a few minutes, reflected profoundly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime, a tall,
loosely-made man entered the room; his spare, thin face, steady
look, and hooked nose, as he entered Colbert's cabinet, with a
modest assurance of manner, revealed a character at once supple
and decided, - supple towards the master who could throw him the
prey, firm towards the dogs who might possibly be disposed to
dispute its possession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
M. Vanel carried a voluminous bundle of papers under his arm, and
placed it on the desk on which Colbert was leaning both his
elbows, as he supported his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Good day, M. Vanel,"
said the latter, rousing himself from his meditation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Vanel, naturally.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You should say
monsieur, and not monseigneur," replied Colbert, gently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We give the title of
monseigneur to ministers," returned Vanel, with extreme
self-possession, "and you are a minister."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are so in point of

seigneur for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me</i>, and
that is sufficient; if you dislike my calling you monseigneur
before others, allow me, at least, to call you so in
private."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert raised his head
as if to read, or try to read, upon Vanel's face how much or how
little sincerity entered into this protestation of devotion.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the counselor knew
perfectly well how to sustain the weight of such a look, even
backed with the full authority of the title he had
conferred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert
sighed; he could not read anything in Vanel's face, and Vanel
might possibly be honest in his professions, but Colbert
recollected that this man, inferior to himself in every other
respect, was actually his master in virtue of the fact of his
having a wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As he was
pitying this man's lot, Vanel coldly drew from his pocket a
perfumed letter, sealed with Spanish wax, and held it towards
Colbert, saying, "A letter from my wife, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Colbert coughed, took,
opened and read the letter, and then put it carefully away in his
pocket, while Vanel turned over the leaves of the papers he had
brought with him with an unmoved and unconcerned air.<span style=

explains why M. Fouquet will be always safe and sound, so long as
he occupies his present post," replied Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"M. Gourville added, 'If we were to do anything out of charity to
M. Fouquet, it could not be otherwise than most humiliating to
him; and he would be sure to refuse it.<span style=

with Madame de Motteville and Se&ntilde;ora Molina.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> King Louis, who had been impatiently
expected the whole day, had not made his appearance; and the
queen, who was growing impatient, had often sent to inquire about
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The moral atmosphere
of the court seemed to indicate an approaching storm; the
courtiers and the ladies of the court avoided meeting in the
ante-chambers and the corridors in order not to converse on
compromising subjects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Monsieur had joined the king early in the morning for a
hunting-party; Madame remained in her own apartment, cool and
distant to every one; and the queen-mother, after she had said
her prayers in Latin, talked of domestic matters with her two
friends in pure Castilian.<span style=

the language perfectly, answered her in French.<span style=

every form of dissimulation and of politeness, as a circuitous
mode of expressing that the king's conduct was making the queen
and the queen-mother pine away through sheer grief and vexation,
and when, in the most guarded and polished phrases, they had
fulminated every variety of imprecation against Mademoiselle de
la Valli&egrave;re, the queen-mother terminated her attack by an
exclamation indicative of her own reflections and character.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "<i style=

- which means, "These children!" words full of meaning on a
mother's lips - words full of terrible significance in the mouth
of a queen who, like Anne of Austria, hid many curious secrets in
her soul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

"children, children! for whom every mother becomes a

she fancied, when she raised her eyes towards the full-length
portrait of the pale Louis XIII., that light once more flashed
from her husband's dull eyes, and his nostrils grew livid with
wrath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The portrait
seemed animated by a living expression - speak it did not, but it
seemed to threaten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A
profound silence succeeded the queen's last remark.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Molina began to turn over ribbons
and laces on a large work-table.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame de Motteville, surprised at
the look of mutual intelligence which had been exchanged between
the confidant and her mistress, cast down her eyes like a
discreet woman, and pretending to be observant of nothing that
was passing, listened with the utmost attention to every
word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She heard nothing,
however, but a very insignificant "hum" on the part of the
Spanish duenna, who was the incarnation of caution - and a
profound sigh on that of the queen.<span style=

caution, a sharp, acute pain seized the queen, who turned deadly
pale, and threw herself back in the chair, with every symptom of
a sudden fainting fit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Molina ran to a richly gilded tortoise-shell cabinet, from which
she took a large rock-crystal bottle of scented salts, and held
it to the queen's nostrils, who inhaled it wildly for a few
minutes, and murmured:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the queen, placing her finger on her lips, to impose silence on
her favorite.</p>

remarked Madame de Motteville, after a pause.</p>

twenty years ago, on that very day, his present majesty, your own
glorious son, was born at the very same hour."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The queen uttered a loud
cry, buried her face in her hands, and seemed utterly prostrated
for some minutes; but whether from recollections which arose in
her mind, or from reflection, or even with sheer pain, was
doubtful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Molina
darted a look at Madame de Motteville, so full of bitter
reproach, that the poor woman, perfectly ignorant of its meaning,
was in her own exculpation on the point of asking an explanation,
when, suddenly, Anne of Austria arose and said, "Yes, the 5th of
September; my sorrow began on the 5th of September.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The greatest joy, one day; the
deepest sorrow the next; - the sorrow," she added, "the bitter
expiation of a too excessive joy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And, from that moment,
Anne of Austria, whose memory and reason seemed to be suspended
for the time, remained impenetrable, with vacant look, mind
almost wandering, and hands hanging heavily down, as if life had
almost departed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We must put her to
bed," said La Molina.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

alone," added the Spanish attendant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame de Motteville
rose; large tears were rolling down the queen's pallid face; and
Molina, having observed this sign of weakness, fixed her black
vigilant eyes upon her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, yes," replied the
queen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Leave us,
Motteville; go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The word "us" produced a
disagreeable effect upon the ears of the French favorite; for it
signified that an interchange of secrets, or of revelations of
the past, was about to be made, and that one person was <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>de trop</i> in the conversation
which seemed likely to take place.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Will Molina, alone, be
sufficient for your majesty to-night?" inquired the French
woman.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," replied the
queen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame de
Motteville bowed in submission, and was about to withdraw, when
suddenly an old female attendant, dressed as if she had belonged
to the Spanish court of the year 1620, opened the door, and
surprised the queen in her tears.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The remedy!" she cried,
delightedly, to the queen, as she unceremoniously approached the
group.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What remedy?" said Anne
of Austria.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "For your majesty's
sufferings," the former replied.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame de Motteville, eagerly; "Monsieur Valot?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; a lady
from Flanders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "From Flanders?<span

queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who sent

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M.
Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "She did not

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Her
position in life?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "She will answer that
herself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Who is she?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "She is
masked."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Go, Molina; go and
see!" cried the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is needless,"
suddenly replied a voice, at once firm and gentle in its tone,
which proceeded from the other side of the tapestry hangings; a
voice which made the attendants start, and the queen tremble
excessively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the same
moment, a masked female appeared through the hangings, and,
before the queen could speak a syllable she added, "I am
connected with the order of the B&eacute;guines of Bruges, and
do, indeed, bring with me the remedy which is certain to effect a
cure of your majesty's complaint."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No one uttered a sound, and the
B&eacute;guine did not move a step.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Speak," said the
queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will, when we
are alone," was the answer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Anne of Austria
looked at her attendants, who immediately withdrew.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The B&eacute;guine, thereupon,
advanced a few steps towards the queen, and bowed reverently
before her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The queen
gazed with increasing mistrust at this woman, who, in her turn,
fixed a pair of brilliant eyes upon her, through her mask.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The queen of
France must, indeed, be very ill," said Anne of Austria, "if it
is known at the B&eacute;guinage of Bruges that she stands in
need of being cured."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your majesty is
not irremediably ill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But tell me how
you happen to know I am suffering?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your majesty has
friends in Flanders."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Since these
friends, then, sent you, mention their names."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Impossible,
madame, since your majesty's memory has not been awakened by your
heart."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Anne of Austria
looked up, endeavoring to discover through the mysterious mask,
and this ambiguous language, the name of her companion, who
expressed herself with such familiarity and freedom; then,
suddenly, wearied by a curiosity which wounded every feeling of
pride in her nature, she said, "You are ignorant, perhaps, that
royal personages are never spoken to with the face masked."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Deign to excuse
me, madame," replied the B&eacute;guine, humbly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I cannot excuse
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I may, possibly,
forgive you, if you throw your mask aside."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have made a vow,
madame, to attend and aid all afflicted and suffering persons,
without ever permitting them to behold my face.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I might have been able to administer
some relief to your body and to your mind, too; but since your
majesty forbids me, I will take my leave.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Adieu, madame, adieu!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>These words were
uttered with a harmony of tone and respect of manner that
disarmed the queen of all anger and suspicion, but did not remove
her feeling of curiosity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"You are right, "she said; "it ill-becomes those who are
suffering to reject the means of relief Heaven sends them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Speak, then; and may you,
indeed, be able, as you assert, to administer relief to my body -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let us first speak
a little of the mind, if you please," said the B&eacute;guine -
"of the mind, which, I am sure, must also suffer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My mind?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There are cancers
so insidious in their nature that their very pulsations cannot be
felt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such cancers,
madame, leave the ivory whiteness of the skin unblemished, and
putrefy not the firm, fair flesh, with their blue tints; the
physician who bends over the patient's chest hears not, though he
listens, the insatiable teeth of the disease grinding onward
through the muscles, and the blood flows freely on; the knife has
never been able to destroy, and rarely, even temporarily, to
disarm the rage of these mortal scourges, - their home is in the
mind, which they corrupt, - they gnaw the whole heart until it
breaks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such, madame, are
the cancers fatal to queens; are you, too, free from their
scourge?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Anne slowly raised
her arm, dazzling in its perfect whiteness, and pure in its
rounded outlines as it was in the time of her earlier days.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The evils to which
you allude," she said, "are the condition of the lives of the
high in rank upon earth, to whom Heaven has imparted mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When those evils become too
heavy to be borne, Heaven lightens their burdens by penitence and
confession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus, only,
we lay down our burden and the secrets that oppress us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, forget not that the same
gracious Heaven, in its mercy, apportions to their trials the
strength of the feeble creatures of its hand; and my strength has
enabled me to bear my burden.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For the secrets of others, the
silence of Heaven is more than sufficient; for my own secrets,
that of my confessor is enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are as
courageous, madame, I see, as ever, against your enemies.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You do not acknowledge your
confidence in your friends?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Queens have no
friends; if you have nothing further to say to me, - if you feel
yourself inspired by Heaven as a prophetess - leave me, I pray,
for I dread the future."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I should have
supposed," said the B&eacute;guine, resolutely, "that you would
rather have dreaded the past."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Hardly had these
words escaped her lips, than the queen rose up proudly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Speak," she cried, in a
short, imperious tone of voice; "explain yourself briefly,
quickly, entirely; or, if not - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nay, do not
threaten me, your majesty," said the B&eacute;guine, gently; "I
came here to you full of compassion and respect.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I came here on the part of a
friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Prove that to
me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Comfort, instead of
irritating me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Easily enough, and
your majesty will see who is friendly to you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What misfortune has happened to your
majesty during these three and twenty years past - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Serious
misfortunes, indeed; have I not lost the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I speak not of
misfortunes of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that</i>
kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I wish to ask you,
if, since the birth of the king, any indiscretion on a friend's
part has caused your majesty the slightest serious anxiety, or
distress?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I do not
understand you," replied the queen, clenching her teeth in order
to conceal her emotion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will make myself
understood, then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your
majesty remembers that the king was born on the 5th of September,
1638, at a quarter past eleven o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," stammered
out the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At half-past
twelve," continued the B&eacute;guine, "the dauphin, who had been
baptized by Monseigneur de Meaux in the king's and your own
presence, was acknowledged as the heir of the crown of
France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king then
went to the chapel of the old Ch&acirc;teau de Saint-Germain, to
hear the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Te Deum</i>
chanted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quite true, quite
true," murmured the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your majesty's
conferment took place in the presence of Monsieur, his majesty's
late uncle, of the princes, and of the ladies attached to the
court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king's
physician, Bouvard, and Honor&eacute;, the surgeon, were
stationed in the ante-chamber; your majesty slept from three
o'clock until seven, I believe."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, yes; but you
tell me no more than every one else knows as well as you and
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am now, madame,
approaching that which very few persons are acquainted with.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Very few persons, did I say,
alas!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I might say two
only, for formerly there were but five in all, and, for many
years past, the secret has been well preserved by the deaths of
the principal participators in it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The late king sleeps now with his
ancestors; Perronnette, the midwife, soon followed him; Laporte
is already forgotten."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The queen opened
her lips as though to reply; she felt, beneath her icy hand, with
which she kept her face half concealed, the beads of perspiration
on her brow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It was eight
o'clock," pursued the B&eacute;guine; "the king was seated at
supper, full of joy and happiness; around him on all sides arose
wild cries of delight and drinking of healths; the people cheered
beneath the balconies; the Swiss guards, the musketeers, and the
royal guards wandered through the city, borne about in triumph by
the drunken students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Those boisterous sounds of general joy disturbed the dauphin, the
future king of France, who was quietly lying in the arms of
Madame de Hausac, his nurse, and whose eyes, as he opened them,
and stared about, might have observed two crowns at the foot of
his cradle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suddenly your
majesty uttered a piercing cry, and Dame Perronnette immediately
flew to your beside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
doctors were dining in a room at some distance from your chamber;
the palace, deserted from the frequency of the irruptions made
into it, was without either sentinels or guards.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The midwife, having questioned and
examined your majesty, gave a sudden exclamation as if in wild
astonishment, and taking you in her arms, bewildered almost out
of her senses from sheer distress of mind, dispatched Laporte to
inform the king that her majesty the queen-mother wished to see
him in her room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Laporte,
you are aware, madame, was a man of the most admirable calmness
and presence of mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
did not approach the king as if he were the bearer of alarming
intelligence and wished to inspire the terror he himself
experienced; besides, it was not a very terrifying intelligence
which awaited the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Therefore, Laporte appeared with a smile upon his lips, and
approached the king's chair, saying to him - 'Sire, the queen is
very happy, and would be still more so to see your majesty.'<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On that day, Louis XIII. would
have given his crown away to the veriest beggar for a 'God bless
you.' <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Animated,
light-hearted, and full of gayety, the king rose from the table,
and said to those around him, in a tone that Henry IV. might have
adopted, - 'Gentlemen, I am going to see my wife.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He came to your beside, madame, at
the very moment Dame Perronnette presented to him a second
prince, as beautiful and healthy as the former, and said - 'Sire,
Heaven will not allow the kingdom of France to fall into the
female line.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king,
yielding to a first impulse, clasped the child in his arms, and
cried, 'Oh, Heaven, I thank Thee!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>At this part of her
recital, the B&eacute;guine paused, observing how intensely the
queen was suffering; she had thrown herself back in her chair,
and with her head bent forward and her eyes fixed, listened
without seeming to hear, and her lips moving convulsively, either
breathing a prayer to Heaven or imprecations on the woman
standing before her.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I do not believe that, if, because
there could be but one dauphin in France, "exclaimed the
B&eacute;guine, "the queen allowed that child to vegetate,
banished from his royal parents' presence, she was on that
account an unfeeling mother.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, no, no; there are those alive
who have known and witnessed the passionate kisses she imprinted
on that innocent creature in exchange for a life of misery and
gloom to which state policy condemned the twin brother of Louis
XIV."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Heaven!" murmured the queen
feebly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is admitted,"
continued the B&eacute;guine, quickly, "that when the king
perceived the effect which would result from the existence of two
sons, equal in age and pretensions, he trembled for the welfare
of France, for the tranquillity of the state; and it is equally
well known that Cardinal de Richelieu, by the direction of Louis
XIII., thought over the subject with deep attention, and after an
hour's meditation in his majesty's cabinet, he pronounced the
following sentence: - 'One prince means peace and safety for the
state; two competitors, civil war and anarchy.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The queen rose
suddenly from her seat, pale as death, and her hands clenched
together:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You know too
much," she said, in a hoarse, thick voice, "since you refer to
secrets of state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for
the friends from whom you have acquired this secret, they are
false and treacherous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You are their accomplice in the crime which is being now
committed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, throw
aside your mask, or I will have you arrested by my captain of the
guards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not think that
this secret terrifies me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You have obtained it, you shall restore it to me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Never shall it leave your bosom, for
neither your secret nor your own life belong to you from this
moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Anne of Austria,
joining gesture to the threat, advanced a couple of steps towards
the B&eacute;guine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Learn," said the
latter, "to know and value the fidelity, the honor, and secrecy
of the friends you have abandoned."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, then, suddenly she threw aside
her mask.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Madame de
Chevreuse!" exclaimed the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"With your majesty,
the sole living <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!" murmured Anne

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Alas! you kill your friend in thus
trifling with her terrible distress."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And the queen,
leaning her head upon the shoulder of the old duchesse, burst
into a flood of bitter tears.<span style=

the latter, in a hollow voice; "you can weep!"</p>

T</span>he queen looked steadily at Madame de Chevreuse, and
said: "I believe you just now made use of the word 'happy' in
speaking of me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hitherto,

grand misfortunes to which we, two old friends, separated by
men's malice, were just now alluding, you possess sources of
pleasure, slight enough in themselves it may be, but greatly
envied by the world."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Anne of Austria, bitterly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What can induce you to pronounce

my body and my mind both stood in need of remedies?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame de
Chevreuse collected herself for a moment, and then murmured, "How
far removed kings are from other people!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

refreshed by the rills of melted snow, cannot comprehend that the

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The queen colored,
for she now began to perceive the drift of her friend's
remark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It was very
wrong," she said, "to have neglected you."</p>

the queen; "but I could - secretly, you know - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And yet my
children did not go into mourning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! you know,
duchesse, the court is very frequently moving about from place to
place; we see M. Albert de Luynes but seldom, and many things
escape our minds in the midst of the preoccupations that
constantly beset us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your majesty ought
not to have believed the report of my death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why not?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Alas! we are all mortal; and
you may perceive how rapidly I, your younger sister, as we used
formerly to say, am approaching the tomb."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If your majesty
believed me dead, you ought, in that case, to have been
astonished not to have received the news."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Death not
unfrequently takes us by surprise, duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! your majesty,
those who are burdened with secrets such as we have just now
discussed must, as a necessity of their nature, satisfy their
craving desire to divulge them, and they feel they must gratify
that desire before they die.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Among the various preparations for
their final journey, the task of placing their papers in order is
not omitted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The queen
started.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your majesty will
be sure to learn, in a particular manner, the day of my
death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In what way?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because your
majesty will receive the next day, under several coverings,
everything connected with our mysterious correspondence of former
times."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Did you not burn
them?" cried Anne, in alarm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Traitors only,"
replied the duchesse, "destroy a royal correspondence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Traitors, do you
say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, certainly, or
rather they pretend to destroy, instead of which they keep or
sell it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Faithful
friends, on the contrary, most carefully secrete such treasures,
for it may happen that some day or other they would wish to seek
out their queen in order to say to her: 'Madame, I am getting
old; my health is fast failing me; in the presence of the danger
of death, for there is the risk for your majesty that this secret
may be revealed, take, therefore, this paper, so fraught with
menace for yourself, and trust not to another to burn it for
you.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What paper do you
refer to?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As far as I am
concerned, I have but one, it is true, but that is indeed most
dangerous in its nature."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! duchesse, tell
me what it is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A letter, dated
Tuesday, the 2d of August, 1644, in which you beg me to go to
Noisy-le-Sec, to see that unhappy child.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In your own handwriting, madame,
there are those words, 'that unhappy child!'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>A profound silence
ensued; the queen's mind was busy in the past; Madame de
Chevreuse was watching the progress of her scheme.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, unhappy, most unhappy!"
murmured Anne of Austria; "how sad the existence he led, poor
child, to finish it in so cruel a manner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Is he dead?" cried
the duchesse suddenly, with a curiosity whose genuine accents the
queen instinctively detected.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He died of
consumption, died forgotten, died withered and blighted like the
flowers a lover has given to his mistress, which she leaves to
die secreted in a drawer where she had hid them from the gaze of
others."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Died!" repeated
the duchesse with an air of discouragement, which would have
afforded the queen the most unfeigned delight, had it not been
tempered in some measure with a mixture of doubt - "Died - at
Noisy-le-Sec?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, in the arms
of his tutor, a poor, honest man, who did not long survive
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That can easily be
understood; it is so difficult to bear up under the weight of
such a loss and such a secret," said Madame de Chevreuse, - the
irony of which reflection the queen pretended not to
perceive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame de
Chevreuse continued: "Well, madame, I inquired some years ago at
Noisy-le-Sec about this unhappy child.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was told that it was not believed
he was dead, and that was my reason for not having at first
condoled with your majesty; for, most certainly, if I could have
thought it were true, never should I have made the slightest
allusion to so deplorable an event, and thus have re-awakened
your majesty's most natural distress."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You say that it is
not believed the child died at Noisy?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What did they say
about him, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"They said - but,
no doubt, they were mistaken - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nay, speak,
speak!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"They said, that
one evening, about the year 1645, a lady, beautiful and majestic
in her bearing, which was observed notwithstanding the mask and
the mantle that concealed her figure - a lady of rank, of very
high rank, no doubt - came in a carriage to the place where the
road branches off; the very same spot, you know, where I awaited
news of the young prince when your majesty was graciously pleased
to send me there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That the boy's
tutor, or guardian, took the child to this lady."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, what
next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That both the
child and his tutor left that part of the country the very next
day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There, you see
there is some truth in what you relate, since, in point of fact,
the poor child died from a sudden attack of illness, which makes
the lives of all children, as doctors say, suspended as it were
by a thread."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What your majesty
says is quite true; no one knows it better than yourself - no one
believes it more strongly than myself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But yet, how strange it is - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What can it now
be?" thought the queen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The person who
gave me these details, who was sent to inquire after the child's
health - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Did you confide
such a charge to any one else?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, duchesse!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Some one as dumb
as your majesty, as dumb as myself; we will suppose it was
myself, Madame; this some one, some months after, passing through
Touraine - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Touraine!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Recognized both
the tutor and the child, too!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am wrong, thought he recognized
them, both living, cheerful, happy, and flourishing, the one in a
green old age, the other in the flower of his youth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Judge after that what truth can be
attributed to the rumors which are circulated, or what faith,
after that, placed in anything that may happen in the world!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I am fatiguing your
majesty; it was not my intention, however, to do so, and I will
take my leave of you, after renewing to you the assurance of my
most respectful devotion."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Stay, duchesse;
let us first talk a little about yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of myself,
madame!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am not worthy
that you should bend your looks upon me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why not,
indeed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you not the
oldest friend I have?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are
you angry with me, duchesse?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I, indeed! what
motive could I have?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I
had reason to be angry with your majesty, should I have come
here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Duchesse, age is
fast creeping on us both; we should be united against that death
whose approach cannot be far off."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You overpower me,
madame, with the kindness of your language."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No one has ever
loved or served me as you have done, duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your majesty is
too kind in remembering it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not so.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Give me a proof of your
friendship, duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My whole being is
devoted to you, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The proof I
require is, that you should ask something of me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ask - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, I know you
well, - no one is more disinterested, more noble, and truly
loyal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do not praise me
too highly, madame," said the duchesse, somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I could never
praise you as much as you deserve to be praised."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And yet, age and
misfortune effect a terrible change in people, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So much the
better; for the beautiful, the haughty, the adored duchesse of
former days might have answered me ungratefully, 'I do not wish
for anything from you.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Heaven be praised!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
misfortunes you speak of have indeed worked a change in you, for
you will now, perhaps, answer me, 'I accept.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The duchesse's look
and smile soon changed at this conclusion, and she no longer
attempted to act a false part.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Speak, dearest,
what do you want?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I must first
explain to you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do so
unhesitatingly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then, your
majesty can confer the greatest, the most ineffable pleasure upon
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is it?" said
the queen, a little distant in her manner, from an uneasiness of
feeling produced by this remark.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But do not forget, my good
Chevreuse, that I am quite as much under my son's influence as I
was formerly under my husband's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will not be too
hard, madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Call me as you
used to do; it will be a sweet echo of our happy youth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then, my
dear mistress, my darling Anne - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you know
Spanish, still?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ask me in Spanish,
then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Will your majesty
do me the honor to pass a few days with me at Dampierre?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Is that all?" said
the queen, stupefied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Nothing more than that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Good heavens! can
you possibly imagine that, in asking you that, I am not asking
you the greatest conceivable favor?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If that really be the case, you do
not know me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will you
accept?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, gladly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And I shall be happy,"
continued the queen, with some suspicion, "if my presence can in
any way be useful to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Useful!" exclaimed
the duchesse, laughing; "oh, no, no, agreeable - delightful, if
you like; and you promise me, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I swear it," said
the queen, whereupon the duchesse seized her beautiful hand, and
covered it with kisses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The queen could not help murmuring to herself, "She is a
good-hearted woman, and very generous, too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Will your majesty
consent to wait a fortnight before you come?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly; but
why?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because," said the
duchesse, "knowing me to be in disgrace, no one would lend me the
hundred thousand francs, which I require to put Dampierre into a
state of repair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But when
it is known that I require that sum for the purpose of receiving
your majesty at Dampierre properly, all the money in Paris will
be at my disposal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!" said the
queen, gently nodding her head in sign of intelligence, "a
hundred thousand francs! you want a hundred thousand francs to
put Dampierre into repair?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quite as much as
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And no one will
lend you them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will lend them
to you, if you like, duchesse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, I hardly dare
accept such a sum."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You would be wrong
if you did <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, a hundred thousand
francs is really not much.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know but too well that you never
set a right value upon your silence and secrecy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Push that table a little towards me,
duchesse, and I will write you an order on M. Colbert; no, on M.
Fouquet, who is a far more courteous and obliging man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Will he pay it,
though?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If he will not pay
it, I will; but it will be the first time he will have refused
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The queen wrote and
handed the duchesse the order, and afterwards dismissed her with
a warm embrace.</p>

A</span>ll these intrigues are exhausted; the human mind, so
variously complicated, has been enabled to develop itself at its
ease in the three outlines with which our recital has supplied
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is not unlikely
that, in the future we are now preparing, a question of politics
and intrigues may still arise, but the springs by which they work
will be so carefully concealed that no one will be able to see
aught but flowers and paintings, just as at a theater, where a
colossus appears upon the scene, walking along moved by the small
legs and slender arms of a child concealed within the
framework.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to be seen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

painstaking in keeping up the reputation of the house, and yet
the gardeners who supplied the kitchens complained of ruinous
delays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The agents for
the supply of Spanish wines sent drafts which no one honored;
fishermen, whom the superintendent engaged on the coast of
Normandy, calculated that if they were paid all that was due to
them, the amount would enable them to retire comfortably for
life; fish, which, at a later period, was the cause of Vatel's
death, did not arrive at all.<span style=

days, Fouquet's friends flocked in more numerously than
ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Gourville and the
Abb&eacute; Fouquet talked over money matters - that is to say,
the abb&eacute; borrowed a few pistoles from Gourville;
P&eacute;lisson, seated with his legs crossed, was engaged in
finishing the peroration of a speech with which Fouquet was to
open the parliament; and this speech was a masterpiece, because
P&eacute;lisson wrote it for his friend - that is to say, he
inserted all kinds of clever things the latter would most
certainly never have taken the trouble to say of his own
accord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Presently Loret
and La Fontaine would enter from the garden, engaged in a dispute
about the art of making verses.<span style=

turn, were hovering near the dining-room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as eight o'clock struck the
supper would be announced, for the superintendent never kept any
one waiting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was
already half-past seven, and the appetites of the guests were
beginning to declare themselves in an emphatic manner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as all the guests were
assembled, Gourville went straight up to P&eacute;lisson, awoke
him out of his reverie, and led him into the middle of a room,
and closed the doors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Well," he said, "anything new?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> P&eacute;lisson raised
his intelligent and gentle face, and said: "I have borrowed five

good sterling money."</p>

Gourville; "we only what one hundred and ninety-five thousand
livres for the first payment."</p>

what?" asked La Fontaine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What!
absent-minded as usual!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Why, it was you who told us the small estate at Corbeli was going
to be sold by one of M. Fouquet's creditors; and you, also, who
proposed that all his friends should subscribe - more than that,
it was you who said that you would sell a corner of your house at
Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry, in order to furnish your own proportion,
and you come and ask - '<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
payment of what?</i>'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>This remark was
received with a general laugh, which made La Fontaine blush.<span

"I had not forgotten it; oh, no! only - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Only you

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is the truth,
and the fact is, he is quite right, there is a great difference
between forgetting and not remembering."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then," added
P&eacute;lisson, "you bring your mite in the shape of the price
of the piece of land you have sold?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sold? no!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you not sold
the field, then?" inquired Gourville, in astonishment, for he
knew the poet's disinterestedness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My wife would not
let me," replied the latter, at which there were fresh bursts of
laughter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And yet you went
to Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry for that purpose," said some one.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly I did,

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Poor fellow!"</p>

caught cold; I returned home and then my wife began to quarrel
with me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In real
earnest?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, in real
earnest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She threw a loaf
of bread at my head, a large loaf."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And what did you
do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I upset the table over her and her
guests; and then I got on my horse again, and here I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Every one had great
difficulty in keeping his countenance at the exposure of this
heroi-comedy, and when the laughter had subsided, one of the
guests present said to La Fontaine: "Is that all you have brought
back?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, no!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have an excellent idea in my
head."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you noticed
that there is a good deal of sportive, jesting poetry written in
France?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, of course,"
replied every one.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And," pursued La
Fontaine, "only a very small portion of it is printed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The laws are
strict, you know."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That may be; but a
rare article is a dear article, and that is the reason why I have
written a small poem, excessively free in its style, very broad,
and extremely cynical in its tone."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The deuce you
have!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," continued
the poet, with assumed indifference, "and I have introduced the
greatest freedom of language I could possibly employ."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Peals of laughter
again broke forth, while the poet was thus announcing the quality
of his wares.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And," he
continued, "I have tried to excel everything that Boccaccio,
Ar&eacute;tin, and other masters of their craft have written in
the same style."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Its fate is
clear," said P&eacute;lisson; "it will be suppressed and
forbidden."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you think so?"
said La Fontaine, simply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"I assure you I did not do it on my own account so much as M.
Fouquet's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>This wonderful
conclusion again raised the mirth of all present.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And I have sold
the first edition of this little book for eight hundred livres,"
exclaimed La Fontaine, rubbing his hands together.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Serious and religions books sell at
about half that rate."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It would have been
better," said Gourville, "to have written two religious books
instead."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It would have been
too long, and not amusing enough," replied La Fontaine
tranquilly; "my eight hundred livres are in this little bag, and
I beg to offer them as <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i> contribution."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>As he said this, he
placed his offering in the hands of their treasurer; it was then
Loret's turn, who gave a hundred and fifty livres; the others
stripped themselves in the same way; and the total sum in the
purse amounted to forty thousand livres.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The money was still being counted
over when the superintendent noiselessly entered the room; he had
heard everything; and then this man, who had possessed so many
millions, who had exhausted all the pleasures and honors the
world had to bestow, this generous heart, this inexhaustible
brain, which had, like two burning crucibles, devoured the
material and moral substance of the first kingdom in Europe, was
seen to cross the threshold with tears in his eyes, and pass his
fingers through the gold and silver which the bag contained.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Poor offering," he
said, in a softened and affected tone of voice, "you will
disappear into the smallest corner of my empty purse, but you
have filled to overflowing that which no one can ever exhaust, my
heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thank you, my
friends - thank you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
as he could not embrace every one present, who were all tearful,
too, philosophers as they were, he embraced La Fontaine, saying
to him, "Poor fellow! so you have, on my account, been beaten by
your wife and censured by your confessor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! it is a mere
nothing," replied the poet; "if your creditors will only wait a
couple of years, I shall have written a hundred other tales,
which, at two editions each, will pay off the debt."</p>

P&eacute;lisson, "we are talking politics."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I wish to know
whether the barrister's gown does or does not become M.

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There is no

at the laughter of those who were present.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"On the contrary,

Loret.</p>

have M. Fouquet left us still, of whom we have no reason to

run away as soon as they see M. Fouquet."<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But why hares?"
objected Conrart, vexed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because the hare

it seems so to me without that gown," said the obstinate
P&eacute;lisson; "what is your opinion, Gourville?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I think the gown
in question is a very good thing," replied the latter; "but I
equally think that a million and a half is far better than the
gown."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And I am of
Gourville's opinion," exclaimed Fouquet, stopping the discussion
by the expression of his own opinion, which would necessarily
bear down all the others.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A million and a
half," P&eacute;lisson grumbled out; "now I happen to know an
Indian fable - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Tell it to me,"
said La Fontaine; "I ought to know it too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Tell it, tell it,"
said the others.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There was a
tortoise, which was, as usual, well protected by its shell," said
P&eacute;lisson; "whenever its enemies threatened it, it took
refuge within its covering.<span style=

must feel very hot in such a house as that in the summer, and you

shell.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Good!" said the
superintendent, laughing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, what next?"
said La Fontaine, more interested in the apologue than in the
moral.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The tortoise sold
his shell and remained naked and defenseless.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A vulture happened to see him, and
being hungry, broke the tortoise's back with a blow of his beak

moral is, that M. Fouquet should take very good care to keep his
gown."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>La Fontaine
understood the moral seriously.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You forget &AElig;schylus," he
said, to his adversary.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you
mean?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"&AElig;schylus was
bald-headed, and a vulture - your vulture, probably - who was a
great amateur in tortoises, mistook at a distance his head for a
block of stone, and let a tortoise, which was shrunk up in his
shell, fall upon it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, yes, La
Fontaine is right," resumed Fouquet, who had become very
thoughtful; "whenever a vulture wishes to devour a tortoise, he
well knows how to break his shell; but happy is that tortoise a
snake pays a million and a half for his envelope.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No; that will be
useless; I will do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
So, away with you, my dear friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>P&eacute;lisson set
off, not quite clear as to his friend's meaning or intention, but
confident, like every true friend, in the judgment of the man he
was blindly obeying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It
is that which constitutes the strength of such men; distrust only
arises in the minds of inferior natures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel bowed lowly
to the superintendent, and was about to begin a speech.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do not trouble
yourself, monsieur," said Fouquet, politely; "I am told you wish
to purchase a post I hold.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How much can you give me for
it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is for you,
monseigneur, to fix the amount you require.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know that offers of purchase have
already been made to you for it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Madame Vanel, I
have been told, values it at fourteen hundred thousand
livres."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is all we
have."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Can you give me
the money immediately?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have not the
money with me," said Vanel, frightened almost by the unpretending
simplicity, amounting to greatness, of the man, for he had
expected disputes, difficulties, opposition of every kind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"When will you be
able to bring it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Whenever you
please, monseigneur;" for he began to be afraid that Fouquet was
trifling with him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If it were not for
the trouble you would have in returning to Paris, I would say at
once; but we will arrange that the payment and the signature
shall take place at six o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good," said
Vanel, as cold as ice, and feeling quite bewildered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Adieu, Monsieur
Vanel, present my humblest respects to Madame Vanel," said
Fouquet, as he rose; upon which Vanel, who felt the blood rushing
to his head, for he was quite confounded by his success, said
seriously to the superintendent, "Will you give me your word,
monseigneur, upon this affair?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet turned
round his head, saying, "<i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pardieu</i>, and you, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel hesitated,
trembled all over, and at last finished by hesitatingly holding
out his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet
opened and nobly extended his own; this loyal hand lay for a
moment in Vanel's most hypocritical palm, and he pressed it in
his own, in order the better to convince himself of the
compact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
superintendent gently disengaged his hand, as he again said,
"Adieu."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then Vanel
ran hastily to the door, hurried along the vestibule, and fled as
quickly as he could.</p>

F</span>ouquet had no sooner dismissed Vanel than he began to
reflect for a few moments - "A man never can do too much for the
woman he has once loved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Marguerite wishes to be the wife of a
procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral - and why not confer this
pleasure upon her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And,
now that the most scrupulous and sensitive conscience will be
unable to reproach me with anything, let my thoughts be bestowed
on her who has shown so much devotion for me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame de Belli&egrave;re ought to
be there by this time," he said, as he turned towards the secret
door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> After he had locked
himself in, he opened the subterranean passage, and rapidly
hastened towards the means of communicating between the house at
Vincennes and his own residence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had neglected to apprise his
friend of his approach, by ringing the bell, perfectly assured
that she would never fail to be exact at the rendezvous; as,
indeed, was the case, for she was already waiting.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The noise the superintendent made
aroused her; she ran to take from under the door the letter he
had thrust there, and which simply said, "Come, marquise; we are
waiting supper for you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
With her heart filled with happiness Madame de Belli&egrave;re
ran to her carriage in the Avenue de Vincennes, and in a few
minutes she was holding out her hand to Gourville, who was
standing at the entrance, where, in order the better to please
his master, he had stationed himself to watch her arrival.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She had not observed that
Fouquet's black horse arrived at the same time, all steaming and
foam-flaked, having returned to Saint-Mand&eacute; with
P&eacute;lisson and the very jeweler to whom Madame de
Belli&egrave;re had sold her plate and her jewels.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> P&eacute;lisson introduced the
goldsmith into the cabinet, which Fouquet had not yet left.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The superintendent thanked him
for having been good enough to regard as a simple deposit in his
hands, the valuable property which he had every right to sell;
and he cast his eyes on the total of the account, which amounted
to thirteen hundred thousand francs.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then, going for a few moments to his
desk, he wrote an order for fourteen hundred thousand francs,
payable at sight, at his treasury, before twelve o'clock the next
day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A hundred thousand
francs profit!" cried the goldsmith.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh, monseigneur, what
generosity!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nay, nay, not so,
monsieur," said Fouquet, touching him on the shoulder; "there are
certain kindnesses which can never be repaid.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This profit is only what you have
earned; but the interest of your money still remains to be
arranged."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, saying
this, he unfastened from his sleeve a diamond button, which the
goldsmith himself had often valued at three thousand
pistoles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Take this," he
said to the goldsmith, "in remembrance of me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Farewell; you are an honest
man."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you, monseigneur,"
cried the goldsmith, completely overcome, "are the noblest man
that ever lived."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet let the worthy
goldsmith pass out of the room by a secret door, and then went to
receive Madame de Belli&egrave;re, who was already surrounded by
all the guests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
marquise was always beautiful, but now her loveliness was more
dazzling than ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do
you not think, gentlemen," said Fouquet, "that madame is more
than usually beautiful this evening?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And do you happen to know why?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Because madame is
really the most beautiful of all women," said some one
present.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; but because she is
the best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And yet - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yet?" said the
marquise, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And yet, all the jewels
which madame is wearing this evening are nothing but false
stones."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this remark
the marquise blushed most painfully.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, oh!" exclaimed all
the guests, "that can very well be said of one who has the finest
diamonds in Paris."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well?" said Fouquet to
P&eacute;lisson, in a low tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, at last I have
understood you," returned the latter; "and you have done
exceedingly well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Supper is ready,
monseigneur," said Vatel, with majestic air and tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The crowd of guests
hurried, more quickly than is usually the case with ministerial
entertainments, towards the banqueting-room, where a magnificent
spectacle presented itself.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon the buffets, upon the
side-tables, upon the supper-table itself, in the midst of
flowers and light, glittered most dazzlingly the richest and most
costly gold and silver plate that could possibly be seen - relics
of those ancient magnificent productions the Florentine artists,
whom the Medici family patronized, sculptured, chased, and
moulded for the purpose of holding flowers, at a time when gold
existed still in France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
These hidden marvels, which had been buried during the civil
wars, timidly reappeared during the intervals of that war of good
taste called La Fronde; at a time when noblemen fighting against
nobleman killed, but did not pillage each other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All the plate present had Madame de
Belli&egrave;re's arms engraved upon it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Look," cried La Fontaine, "here is
a P and a B."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But the most remarkable
object present was the cover which Fouquet had assigned to the
marquise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Near her was a
pyramid of diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, antique cameos,
sardonyx stones, carved by the old Greeks of Asia Minor, with
mountings of Mysian gold; curious mosaics of ancient Alexandria,
set in silver; massive Egyptian bracelets lay heaped on a large
plate of Palissy ware, supported by a tripod of gilt bronze,
sculptured by Benvenuto Cellini.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The marquise turned pale, as she
recognized what she had never expected to see again.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A profound silence fell on every one
of the restless and excited guests.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet did not even make a sign in
dismissal of the richly liveried servants who crowded like bees
round the huge buffets and other tables in the room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Gentlemen," he said, "all this
plate which you behold once belonged to Madame de
Belli&egrave;re, who, having observed one of her friends in great
distress, sent all this gold and silver, together with the heap
of jewels now before her, to her goldsmith.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This noble conduct of a devoted
friend can well be understood by such friends as you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Happy indeed is that man who sees
himself loved in such a manner.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us drink to the health of Madame
de Belli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A tremendous burst of
applause followed his words, and made poor Madame de
Belli&egrave;re sink back dumb and breathless in her seat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And then," added
P&eacute;lisson, who was always affected by a noble action, as he
was invariably impressed by beauty, "let us also drink to the
health of him who inspired madame's noble conduct; for such a man
is worthy of being worthily loved."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> It was now the
marquise's turn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She
rose, pale and smiling; and as she held out her glass with a
faltering hand, and her trembling fingers touched those of
Fouquet, her look, full of love, found its mirror in that of her
ardent and generous-hearted lover.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Begun in this manner, the supper
soon became a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i>; no one tried to be
witty, but no one failed in being so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Fontaine forgot his Gorgny wine,
and allowed Vatel to reconcile him to the wines of the
Rh&ocirc;ne, and those from the shores of Spain.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Abb&eacute; Fouquet became so
kind and good-natured, that Gourville said to him, "Take care,
monsieur l'abb&eacute;; if you are so tender, you will be carved
and eaten."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The hours passed away so
joyously, that, contrary to his usual custom, the superintendent
did not leave the table before the end of the dessert.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He smiled upon his friends,
delighted as a man is whose heart becomes intoxicated before his
head - and, for the first time, looked at the clock.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suddenly a carriage rolled into the
courtyard, and, strange to say, it was heard high above the noise
of the mirth which prevailed.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet listened attentively, and
then turned his eyes towards the ante-chamber.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It seemed as if he could hear a step
passing across it, a step that, instead of pressing the ground,
weighed heavily upon his heart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "M. d'Herblay, bishop of Vannes,"
the usher announced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
Aramis's grave and thoughtful face appeared upon the threshold of

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! pretexts are
never wanting with <i style=

that the duchesse has a good many letters of M. de Mazarin's in
her possession."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am not surprised
at that, for the prelate was gallant enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, but these

affairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They concern, it
is said, financial matters rather."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And accordingly
they are less interesting."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you not suspect

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you never
heard speak of a prosecution being instituted for an
embezzlement, or appropriation rather, of public funds?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, a hundred,
nay, a thousand times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Ever since I have been engaged in public matters I have hardly
heard of anything else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It is precisely your own case, when, as a bishop, people reproach
you for impiety; or, as a musketeer, for your cowardice; the very
thing of which they are always accusing ministers of finance is
the embezzlement of public funds."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good; but
take a particular instance, for the duchesse asserts that M. de
Mazarin alludes to certain particular instances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What are
they?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Something like a
sum of thirteen millions of francs, of which it would be very
difficult for you to define the precise nature of the
employment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Thirteen
millions!" said the superintendent, stretching himself in his
armchair, in order to enable him the more comfortably to look up
towards the ceiling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Thirteen millions - I am trying to remember out of all those I
have been accused of having stolen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do not laugh, my
dear monsieur, for it is very serious.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is positive that the duchesse has
certain letters in her possession, and that these letters must be
as she represents them, since she wished to sell them to me for
five hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! one can have a
very tolerable calumny got up for such a sum as that," replied
Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! now I know
what you mean," and he began to laugh very heartily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So much the
better," said Aramis, a little reassured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I remember the
story of those thirteen millions now.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, yes, I remember them quite
well."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am delighted to
hear it; tell me about them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then, one
day Signor Mazarin, Heaven rest his soul! made a profit of
thirteen millions upon a concession of lands in the Valtelline;
he canceled them in the registry of receipts, sent them to me,
and then made me advance them to him for war expenses."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good; then
there is no doubt of their proper destination."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No; the cardinal
made me invest them in my own name, and gave me a receipt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You have the
receipt?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of course," said
Fouquet, as he quietly rose from his chair, and went to his large
ebony bureau inlaid with mother-of-pearl and gold.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What I most admire
in you," said Aramis, with an air of great satisfaction, "is,
your memory in the first place, then your self-possession, and,
finally, the perfect order which prevails in your administration;
you, of all men, too, who are by nature a poet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," said
Fouquet, "I am orderly out of a spirit of idleness, to save
myself the trouble of looking after things, and so I know that
Mazarin's receipt is in the third drawer under the letter M; I
open the drawer, and place my hand upon the very paper I
need.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the night,
without a light, I could find it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And with a
confident hand he felt the bundle of papers which were piled up
in the open drawer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Nay,
more than that," he continued, "I remember the paper as if I saw
it; it is thick, somewhat crumpled, with gilt edges; Mazarin had
made a blot upon the figure of the date.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah!" he said, "the paper knows we
are talking about it, and that we want it very much, and so it
hides itself out of the way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And as the
superintendent looked into the drawer, Aramis rose from his
seat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"This is very
singular," said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your memory is
treacherous, my dear monseigneur; look in another drawer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet took out
the bundle of papers, and turned them over once more; he then
grew very pale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Don't confine your
search to that drawer," said Aramis; "look elsewhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quite useless; I
have never made a mistake; no one but myself arranges any papers
of mine of this nature; no one but myself ever opens this drawer,
of which, besides, no one, myself excepted, is aware of the
secret."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you
conclude, then?" said Aramis, agitated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That Mazarin's
receipt has been stolen from me; Madame de Chevreuse was right,
chevalier; I have appropriated the public funds, I have robbed
the state coffers of thirteen millions of money; I am a thief,
Monsieur d'Herblay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nay, nay, do not
get irritated - do not get excited."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And why not,
chevalier? surely there is every reason for it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If legal proceedings are well
arranged, and a judgment given in accordance with them, your
friend the superintendent will soon follow Montfau&ccedil;on, his
colleague Enguerrand de Marigny, and his predecessor,
Semblan&ccedil;ay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!" said Aramis,
smiling, "not so fast as that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And why not? why
not so fast?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What do you
suppose Madame de Chevreuse has done with those letters - for you
refused them, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; at once.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I suppose that she went and
sold them to M. Colbert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I said I supposed
so; I might have said I was sure of it, for I had her followed,
and, when she left me, she returned to her own house, went out by
a back door, and proceeded straight to the intendant's house in
the Rue Croix des Petits-Champs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Legal proceedings
will be instituted, then, scandal and dishonor will follow; and
all will fall upon me like a thunderbolt, blindly,
pitilessly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis approached
Fouquet, who sat trembling in his chair, close to the open
drawers; he placed his hand on his shoulder, and in an
affectionate tone of voice, said: "Do not forget that the
position of M. Fouquet can in no way be compared to that of
Semblan&ccedil;ay or of Marigny."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And why not, in
Heaven's name?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because the
proceedings against those ministers were determined, completed,
and the sentence carried out, whilst in your case the same thing
cannot take place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Another blow, why
not?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A peculator is,
under any circumstances, a criminal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Criminals who know
how to find a safe asylum are never in danger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What! make my
escape?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fly?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, I do not mean
that; you forget that all such proceedings originate in the
parliament, that they are instituted by the
procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, and that you are the
procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You see that, unless you wish to
condemn yourself - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!" cried
Fouquet, suddenly, dashing his fist upon the table.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well! what? what
is the matter?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am
procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral no longer."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis, at this
reply, became as livid as death; he pressed his hands together
convulsively, and with a wild, haggard look, which almost
annihilated Fouquet, he said, laying a stress on every distinct
syllable, "You are procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral no longer, do
you say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Since when?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Since the last
four or five hours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Take care,"
interrupted Aramis, coldly; "I do not think you are in the full
possession of your senses, my friend; collect yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I tell you,"
returned Fouquet, "that a little while ago, some one came to me,
brought by my friends, to offer me fourteen hundred thousand
francs for the appointment, and that I sold it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis looked as
though he had been struck by lightning; the intelligent and
mocking expression of his countenance assumed an aspect of such
profound gloom and terror, that it had more effect upon the
superintendent than all the exclamations and speeches in the
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You had need of
money, then?" he said, at last.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; to discharge
a debt of honor."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And in
a few words, he gave Aramis an account of Madame de
Belli&egrave;re's generosity, and the manner in which he had
thought it but right to discharge that act of generosity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," said Aramis,
"that is, indeed, a fine trait.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What has it cost?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly the
fourteen hundred thousand francs - the price of my
appointment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Which you received
in that manner, without reflection.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, imprudent man!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have not yet
received the amount, but I shall to-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is not yet
completed, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It must be carried
out, though; for I have given the goldsmith, for twelve o'clock
to-morrow, an order upon my treasury, into which the purchaser's
money will be paid at six or seven o'clock."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Heaven be
praised!" cried Aramis, clapping his hands together, "nothing is
yet completed, since you have not yet been paid."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But the
goldsmith?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You shall receive
the fourteen hundred thousand francs from me, at a quarter before
twelve."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Stay a moment; it
is at six o'clock, this very morning, that I am to sign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will answer that you do not
sign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have given my
word, chevalier."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If you have given
it, you will take it back again, that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Can I believe what
I hear?" cried Fouquet, in a most expressive tone.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Fouquet recall his word, after it
has once been pledged!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis replied to
the almost stern look of the minister by a look full of
anger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur," he
said, "I believe I have deserved to be called a man of
honor?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As a soldier, I
have risked my life five hundred times; as a priest I have
rendered still greater services, both to the state and to my
friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The value of a
word, once passed, is estimated according to the worth of the man
who gives it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So long as
it is in his own keeping, it is of the purest, finest gold; when
his wish to keep it has passed away, it is a two-edged
sword.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With that word,
therefore, he defends himself as with an honorable weapon,
considering that, when he disregards his word, he endangers his
life and incurs an amount of risk far greater than that which his
adversary is likely to derive of profit.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In such a case, monsieur, he appeals
to Heaven and to justice."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet bent down
his head, as he replied, "I am a poor, self-determined man, a
true Breton born; my mind admires and fears yours.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I do not say that I keep my word
from a proper feeling only; I keep it, if you like, from custom,
practice, pride, or what you will; but, at all events, the
ordinary run of men are simple enough to admire this custom of
mine; it is my sole good quality - leave me such honor as it
confers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And so you are
determined to sign the sale of the very appointment which can
alone defend you against all your enemies."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, I shall
sign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will deliver
yourself up, then, bound hand and foot, from a false notion of
honor, which the most scrupulous casuists would disdain?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I shall sign,"
repeated Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis sighed
deeply, and looked all round him with the impatient gesture of a
man who would gladly dash something to pieces, as a relief to his
feelings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "We have still
one means left," he said; "and I trust you will not refuse me to
make use of that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly not, if
it be loyal and honorable; as everything is, in fact, which you
propose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I know nothing
more loyal than the renunciation of your purchaser.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly: but -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'But!' - if you
allow me to manage the affair, I do not despair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! you shall be
absolutely master to do what you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Whom are you in
treaty with?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What manner
of man is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am not aware
whether you know the parliament."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Most of its
members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One of the
presidents, perhaps?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No; only a
counselor, of the name of Vanel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis became
perfectly purple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Vanel!" he cried, rising abruptly from his seat; "Vanel! the
husband of Marguerite Vanel?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of your former
mistress?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, my dear
fellow; she is anxious to be the wife of the
procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I certainly owed poor Vanel that
slight concession, and I am a gainer by it; since I, at the same
time, can confer a pleasure on his wife."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis walked
straight up to Fouquet, and took hold of his hand.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do you know," he said, very calmly,
"the name of Madame Vanel's new lover?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! she has a new
lover, then?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was not
aware of it; no, I have no idea what his name is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"His name is M.
Jean-Baptiste Colbert; he is intendant of the finances: he lives
in the Rue Croix des Petits-Champs, where Madame de Chevreuse has
been this evening to take him Mazarin's letters, which she wishes
to sell."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Gracious Heaven!"
murmured Fouquet, passing his hand across his forehead, from
which the perspiration was starting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You now begin to
understand, do you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That I am utterly
lost! - yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you now think
it worth while to be so scrupulous with regard to keeping your
word?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," said
Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"These obstinate
people always contrive matters in such a way, that one cannot but
admire them all the while," murmured Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet held out
his hand to him, and, at the very moment, a richly ornamented
tortoise-shell clock, supported by golden figures, which was
standing on a console table opposite to the fireplace, struck
six.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sound of a door
being opened in the vestibule was heard, and Gourville came to
the door of the cabinet to inquire if Fouquet would received M.
Vanel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet turned his
eyes from the gaze of Aramis, and then desired that M. Vanel
should be shown in.</p>

V</span>anel, who entered at this stage of the conversation, was
nothing less for Aramis and Fouquet than the full stop which
completes a phrase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But,
for Vanel, Aramis's presence in Fouquet's cabinet had quite
another signification; and, therefore, at his first step into the
room, he paused as he looked at the delicate yet firm features of
the bishop of Vannes, and his look of astonishment soon became
one of scrutinizing attention.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for Fouquet, a perfect
politician, that is to say, complete master of himself, he had
already, by the energy of his own resolute will, contrived to
remove from his face all traces of the emotion which Aramis's
revelation had occasioned.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was no longer, therefore, a man
overwhelmed by misfortune and reduced to resort to expedients; he
held his head proudly erect, and indicated by a gesture that
Vanel could enter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was
now the first minister of the state, and in his own palace.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis knew the superintendent
well; the delicacy of the feelings of his heart and the exalted
nature of his mind no longer surprised him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He confined himself, then, for the
moment - intending to resume later an active part in the
conversation - to the performance of the difficult part of a man
who looks on and listens, in order to learn and understand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Vanel was visibly overcome,
and advanced into the middle of the cabinet, bowing to everything
and everybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I am
here," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are punctual,
Monsieur Vanel," returned Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In matters of business,
monseigneur," replied Vanel, "I look upon exactitude as a
virtue."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No doubt,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I beg your
pardon," interrupted Aramis, indicating Vanel with his finger,
but addressing himself to Fouquet; "this is the gentleman, I
believe, who has come about the purchase of your
appointment?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, I am,"
replied Vanel, astonished at the extremely haughty tone in which
Aramis had put the question; "but in what way am I to address
you, who do me the honor - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Call me
monseigneur," replied Aramis, dryly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Vanel bowed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Come, gentlemen, a
truce to these ceremonies; let us proceed to the matter
itself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monseigneur sees,"
said Vanel, "that I am waiting your pleasure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"On the contrary, I
am waiting," replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What for, may I be
permitted to ask, monseigneur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I thought that you
had perhaps something to say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh," said Vanel to
himself, "he has reflected on the matter and I am lost."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But resuming his courage, he
continued, "No, monseigneur, nothing, absolutely nothing more
than what I said to you yesterday, and which I am again ready to
repeat to you now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Come, now, tell me
frankly, Monsieur Vanel, is not the affair rather a burdensome
one for you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly,
monseigneur; fourteen hundred thousand francs is an important
sum."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So important,
indeed," said Fouquet, "that I have reflected - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You have been
reflecting, do you say, monseigneur?" exclaimed Vanel,
anxiously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; that you
might not yet be in a position to purchase."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh,
monseigneur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do not make
yourself uneasy on that score, Monsieur Vanel; I shall not blame
you for a failure in your word, which evidently may arise from
inability on your part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, yes,
monseigneur, you would blame me, and you would be right in doing
so," said Vanel; "for a man must either be very imprudent, or a
fool, to undertake engagements which he cannot keep; and I, at
least, have always regarded a thing agreed on as a thing actually
carried out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet colored,
while Aramis uttered a "Hum!" of impatience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You would be wrong
to exaggerate such notions as those, monsieur," said the
superintendent; "for a man's mind is variable, and full of these
very excusable caprices, which are, however, sometimes estimable
enough; and a man may have wished for something yesterday of
which he repents to-day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel felt a cold
sweat trickle down his face.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monseigneur!" he muttered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis, who was
delighted to find the superintendent carry on the debate with
such clearness and precision, stood leaning his arm upon the
marble top of a console table and began to play with a small gold
knife, with a malachite handle.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet did not hasten to reply; but
after a moment's pause, "Come, my dear Monsieur Vanel," he said,
"I will explain to you how I am situated."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Vanel began to tremble.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yesterday I wished
to sell - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monseigneur did
more than wish to sell, he actually sold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, well, that
may be so; but to-day I ask you the favor to restore me my word
which I pledged you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I received your <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>word</i> as a satisfactory
assurance that it would be kept."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I know that, and
that is the reason why I now entreat you; do you understand
me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I entreat you to
restore it to me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet suddenly
paused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The words "I
entreat you," the effect of which he did not immediately
perceive, seemed almost to choke him as he uttered it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis, still playing with his
knife, fixed a look upon Vanel which seemed as if he wished to
penetrate the recesses of his heart.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Vanel simply bowed, as he said, "I
am overcome, monseigneur, at the honor you do me to consult me
upon a matter of business which is already completed; but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nay, do not say <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i>, dear Monsieur
Vanel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Alas! monseigneur,
you see," he said, as he opened a large pocket-book, "I have
brought the money with me, - the whole sum, I mean.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And here, monseigneur, is the
contract of sale which I have just effected of a property
belonging to my wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
order is authentic in every particular, the necessary signatures
have been attached to it, and it is made payable at sight; it is
ready money, in fact, and, in one word, the whole affair is
complete."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My dear Monsieur
Vanel, there is not a matter of business in this world, however
important it may be, which cannot be postponed in order to oblige
a man, who, by that means, might and would be made a devoted
friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly," said
Vanel, awkwardly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And much more
justly acquired would that friend become, Monsieur Vanel, since
the value of the service he had received would have been so
considerable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, what
do you say? what do you decide?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel preserved a
perfect silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the
meantime, Aramis had continued his close observation of the
man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Vanel's narrow face,
his deeply sunken eyes, his arched eyebrows, had revealed to the
bishop of Vannes the type of an avaricious and ambitious
character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis's
method was to oppose one passion by another.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He saw that M. Fouquet was defeated
- morally subdued - and so he came to his rescue with fresh
weapons in his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Excuse me, monseigneur," he said; "you forgot to show M. Vanel
that his own interests are diametrically opposed to this
renunciation of the sale."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel looked at the
bishop with astonishment; he had hardly expected to find an
auxiliary in him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet
also paused to listen to the bishop.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you not see,"
continued Aramis, "that M. Vanel, in order to purchase your
appointment, has been obliged to sell a property belonging to his
wife; well, that is no slight matter; for one cannot displace, as
he has done, fourteen or fifteen hundred thousand francs without
some considerable loss, and very serious inconvenience."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Perfectly true,"
said Vanel, whose secret Aramis had, with keen-sighted gaze,
wrung from the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Inconveniences
such as these are matters of great expense and calculation, and
whenever a man has money matters to deal with, the expenses are
generally the very first thing thought of."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, yes," said
Fouquet, who began to understand Aramis's meaning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel remained
perfectly silent; he, too, had understood him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis observed his coldness of
manner and his silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Very good," he said to himself, "you are waiting, I see, until
you know the amount; but do not fear, I shall send you such a
flight of crowns that you cannot but capitulate on the spot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"We must offer M.
Vanel a hundred thousand crowns at once," said Fouquet, carried
away by his generous feelings.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The sum was a good
one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A prince, even,
would have been satisfied with such a bonus.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A hundred thousand crowns at that
period was the dowry of a king's daughter.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Vanel, however, did not move.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He is a perfect
rascal!" thought the bishop, "well, we must offer the five
hundred thousand francs at once," and he made a sign to Fouquet
accordingly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You seem to have
spent more than that, dear Monsieur Vanel," said the
superintendent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The
price of ready money is enormous.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You must have made a great sacrifice
in selling your wife's property.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, what can I have been thinking
of?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I ought to have
offered to sign you an order for five hundred thousand francs;
and even in that case I shall feel that I am greatly indebted to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>There was not a
gleam of delight or desire on Vanel's face, which remained
perfectly impassible; not a muscle of it changed in the slightest
degree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis cast a
look almost of despair at Fouquet, and then, going straight up to
Vanel and taking hold of him by the coat, in a familiar manner,
he said, "Monsieur Vanel, it is neither the inconvenience, nor
the displacement of your money, nor the sale of your wife's
property even, that you are thinking of at this moment; it is
something more important still.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I can well understand it; so pay
particular attention to what I am going to say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, monseigneur,"
Vanel replied, beginning to tremble in every limb, as the
prelate's eyes seemed almost ready to devour him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I offer you,
therefore, in the superintendent's name, not three hundred
thousand livres, nor five hundred thousand, but a million.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A million - do you understand
me?" he added, as he shook him nervously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A million!"
repeated Vanel, as pale as death.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A million; in
other words, at the present rate of interest, an income of
seventy thousand francs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Come, monsieur,"
said Fouquet, "you can hardly refuse that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Answer - do you accept?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Impossible,"
murmured Vanel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis bit his
lips, and something like a cloud seemed to pass over his
face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The thunder behind
this cloud could easily be imagined.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He still kept his hold on
Vanel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You have
purchased the appointment for fifteen hundred thousand francs, I
think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, you will
receive these fifteen hundred thousand francs back again; by
paying M. Fouquet a visit, and shaking hands with him on the
bargain, you will have become a gainer of a million and a
half.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You get honor and
profit at the same time, Monsieur Vanel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I cannot do it,"
said Vanel, hoarsely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well,"
replied Aramis, who had grasped Vanel so tightly by the coat
that, when he let go his hold, Vanel staggered back a few paces,
"very well; one can now see clearly enough your object in coming
here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," said
Fouquet, "one can easily see that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But - " said
Vanel, attempting to stand erect before the weakness of these two
men of honor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Does the fellow
presume to speak?" said Aramis, with the tone of an emperor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Fellow!" repeated
Vanel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The scoundrel, I
meant to say," added Aramis, who had now resumed his usual
self-possession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Come,
monsieur, produce your deed of sale, - you have it about you, I
suppose, in one of your pockets, already prepared, as an assassin
holds his pistol or his dagger concealed under his cloak.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel began to
mutter something.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Enough!" cried
Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Where is this
deed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel tremblingly
searched in his pockets, and as he drew out his pocket-book, a
paper fell out of it, while Vanel offered the other to
Fouquet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis pounced
upon the paper which had fallen out, as soon as he recognized the
handwriting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I beg your
pardon," said Vanel, "that is a rough draft of the deed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I see that very
clearly," retorted Aramis, with a smile more cutting than a lash
of a whip; "and what I admire most is, that this draft is in M.
Colbert's handwriting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Look, monseigneur, look."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And he handed the
draft to Fouquet, who recognized the truth of the fact; for,
covered with erasures, with inserted words, the margins filled
with additions, this deed - a living proof of Colbert's plot -
had just revealed everything to its unhappy victim.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well!" murmured Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Vanel, completely
humiliated, seemed as if he were looking for some hole wherein to
hide himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well!" said
Aramis, "if your name were not Fouquet, and if your enemy's name
were not Colbert - if you had not this mean thief before you, I
should say to you, 'Repudiate it;' such a proof as this absolves
you from your word; but these fellows would think you were
afraid; they would fear you less than they do; therefore sign the
deed at once."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he
held out a pen towards him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet pressed
Aramis's hand; but, instead of the deed which Vanel handed to
him, he took the rough draft of it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, not that
paper," said Aramis, hastily; "this is the one.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The other is too precious a document
for you to part with."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, no!" replied
Fouquet; "I will sign under M. Colbert's own handwriting even;
and I write, 'The handwriting is approved of.'"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then signed, and said, "Here it
is, Monsieur Vanel."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
the latter seized the paper, dashed down the money, and was about
to make his escape.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"One moment," said
Aramis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Are you quite
sure the exact amount is there?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It ought to be counted over,
Monsieur Vanel; particularly since M. Colbert makes presents of
money to ladies, I see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Ah, that worthy M. Colbert is not so generous as M.
Fouquet."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Aramis,
spelling every word, every letter of the order to pay, distilled
his wrath and his contempt, drop by drop, upon the miserable
wretch, who had to submit to this torture for a quarter of an
hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was then
dismissed, not in words, but by a gesture, as one dismisses or
discharges a beggar or a menial.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>As soon as Vanel
had gone, the minister and the prelate, their eyes fixed on each
other, remained silent for a few moments.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well," said
Aramis, the first to break the silence; "to what can that man be
compared, who, at the very moment he is on the point of entering
into a conflict with an enemy armed from head to foot, panting
for his life, presents himself for the contest utterly
defenseless, throws down his arms, and smiles and kisses his
hands to his adversary in the most gracious manner?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Good faith, M. Fouquet, is a weapon
which scoundrels frequently make use of against men of honor, and
it answers their purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Men of honor, ought, in their turn, also, to make use of
dishonest means against such scoundrels.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You would soon see how strong they
would become, without ceasing to be men of honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What they did
would be termed the acts of a scoundrel," replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Far from that; it
would be merely coquetting or playing with the truth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At all events, since you have
finished with this Vanel; since you have deprived yourself of the
happiness of confounding him by repudiating your word; and since
you have given up, for the purpose of being used against
yourself, the only weapon which can ruin you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My dear friend,"
said Fouquet, mournfully, "you are like the teacher of philosophy
whom La Fontaine was telling us about the other day; he saw a
child drowning, and began to read him a lecture divided into
three heads."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis smiled as he
said, "Philosophy - yes; teacher - yes; a drowning child - yes;
but a child can be saved - you shall see.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But first of all let us talk about
business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Did you not
some time ago," he continued, as Fouquet looked at him with a
bewildered air, "speak to me about an idea you had of giving a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> at Vaux?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!" said Fouquet,
"that was when affairs were flourishing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>f&ecirc;te</i>, I believe, to which
the king invited himself of his own accord?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, no, my dear
prelate; a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i>
to which M. Colbert advised the king to invite himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah - exactly; as
it would be a <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> of so costly a
character that you would be ruined in giving it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Precisely so.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In happier days, as I said
just now, I had a kind of pride in showing my enemies how
inexhaustible my resources were; I felt it a point of honor to
strike them with amazement, by creating millions under
circumstances where they imagined nothing but bankruptcies and
failures would follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But, at present, I am arranging my accounts with the state, with
the king, with myself; and I must now become a mean, stingy man;
I shall be able to prove to the world that I can act or operate
with my deniers as I used to do with my bags of pistoles, and
from to-morrow my equipages shall be sold, my mansions mortgaged,
my expenses curtailed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"From to-morrow,"
interrupted Aramis, quietly, "you will occupy yourself, without
the slightest delay, with your <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> at Vaux, which must
hereafter be spoken of as one of the most magnificent productions
of your most prosperous days."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are you mad, Chevalier
d'Herblay?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

so?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What do you mean,
then?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you not know
that a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> at
Vaux, one of the very simplest possible character, would cost
four or five millions?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I do not speak of a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> of the very
simplest possible character, my dear superintendent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But, since the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> is to be given
to the king," replied Fouquet, who misunderstood Aramis's idea,
"it cannot be simple."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Just so: it ought to be
on a scale of the most unbounded magnificence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, I shall
have to spend ten or twelve millions."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You shall spend
twenty, if you require it," said Aramis, in a perfectly calm
voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where shall I get
them?" exclaimed Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is my affair,
monsieur le surintendant; and do not be uneasy for a moment about
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The money shall be
placed at once at your disposal, the moment you have arranged the
plans of your <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>f&ecirc;te</i>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Chevalier!
chevalier!" said Fouquet, giddy with amazement, "whither are you
hurrying me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Across the gulf
into which you were about to fall," replied the bishop of
Vannes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Take hold of my
cloak, and throw fear aside."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why did you not
tell me that sooner, Aramis?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was a day when, with one
million only, you could have saved me; whilst to-day - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Whilst to-day I
can give you twenty," said the prelate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Such is the case, however - the
reason is very simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On
the day you speak of, I had not the million which you had need of
at my disposal, whilst now I can easily procure the twenty
millions we require."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"May Heaven hear
you, and save me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis resumed his
usual smile, the expression of which was so singular.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Heaven never fails to hear me," he
said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I abandon myself
to your unreservedly," Fouquet murmured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, no; I do not
understand it in that manner.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am unreservedly devoted to
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore, as you
have the clearest, the most delicate, and the most ingenious mind
of the two, you shall have entire control over the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i>, even to the very
smallest details.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Only?" said
Fouquet, as a man accustomed to understand and appreciate the
value of a parenthesis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then,
leaving the entire invention of the details to you, I shall
reserve to myself a general superintendence over the
execution."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In what way?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I mean, that you
will make of me, on that day, a major-domo, a sort of
inspector-general, or factotum - something between a captain of
the guard and manager or steward.<span style=

reach those for whom they are intended - you understand?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, I am very far
from understanding."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But you
agree?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of course, of

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is all I care
about, then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thanks; and

O</span>ur readers will have observed in this story, the
adventures of the new and of the past generation being detailed,
as it were, side by side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He will have noticed in the former, the reflection of the glory
of earlier years, the experience of the bitter things of this
world; in the former, also, that peace which takes possession of
the heart, and that healing of the scars which were formerly deep
and painful wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
the latter, the conflicts of love and vanity; bitter
disappointments, ineffable delights; life instead of memory.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If, therefore, any variety has
been presented to the reader in the different episodes of this
tale, it is to be attributed to the numerous shades of color
which are presented on this double tablet, where two pictures are
seen side by side, mingling and harmonizing their severe and
pleasing tones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
repose of the emotions of one is found in harmonious contrast
with the fiery sentiments of the other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After having talked reason with
older heads, one loves to talk nonsense with youth.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Therefore, if the threads of the
story do not seem very intimately to connect the chapter we are
now writing with the one we have just written, we do not intend
to give ourselves any more thought or trouble about it than
Ruysda&euml;l took in painting an autumn sky, after having
finished a spring-time scene.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We accordingly resume Raoul de
Bragelonne's story at the very place where our last sketch left
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> In a state of frenzy and
dismay, or rather without power or will of his own, - hardly
knowing what he was doing, - he fled swiftly, after the scene in
La Valli&egrave;re's chamber, that strange exclusion, Louise's
grief, Montalais's terror, the king's wrath - all seemed to
indicate some misfortune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But what?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had arrived
from London because he had been told of the existence of a
danger; and almost on his arrival this appearance of danger was
manifest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was not this
sufficient for a lover?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Certainly it was, but it was insufficient for a pure and upright
heart such as his.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And
yet Raoul did not seek for explanations in the very quarter where
more jealous or less timid lovers would have done.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not go straightaway to his
mistress, and say, "Louise, is it true that you love me no
longer?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it true that
you love another?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Full
of courage, full of friendship as he was full of love; a
religious observer of his word, and believing blindly the word of
others, Raoul said within himself, "Guiche wrote to put me on my
guard, Guiche knows something; I will go and ask Guiche what he
knows, and tell him what I have seen."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The journey was not a long one.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Guiche, who had been brought
from Fontainebleau to Paris within the last two days, was
beginning to recover from his wounds, and to walk about a little
in his room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He uttered a
cry of joy as he saw Raoul, with the eagerness of friendship,
enter the apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Raoul was unable to refrain from a cry of grief, when he saw De
Guiche, so pale, so thin, so melancholy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A very few words, and a simple
gesture which De Guiche made to put aside Raoul's arm, were
sufficient to inform the latter of the truth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! so it is," said
Raoul, seating himself beside his friend; "one loves and
dies."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, no, not dies,"
replied Guiche, smiling, "since I am now recovering, and since,
too, I can press you in my arms."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I understand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And I understand you,

Guiche, smiling as he quitted Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul remained
motionless, absorbed in grief, overwhelmed, like the miner upon
whom a vault has just fallen in, who, wounded, his life-blood
welling fast, his thoughts confused, endeavors to recover
himself, to save his life and to retain his reason.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A few minutes were all Raoul needed
to dissipate the bewildering sensations occasioned by these two
revelations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had
already recovered the thread of his ideas, when, suddenly,
through the door, he fancied he recognized Montalais's voice in
the Cabinet des Porcelaines.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "She!" he cried.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, it is indeed her voice!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She will be able to tell me
the whole truth; but shall I question her here?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She conceals herself even from me;
she is coming, no doubt, from Madame.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will see her in her own
apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She will
explain her alarm, her flight, the strange manner in which I was
driven out; she will tell me all that - after M. d'Artagnan, who
knows everything, shall have given me a fresh strength and
courage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame, a
coquette I fear, and yet a coquette who is herself in love, has
her moments of kindness; a coquette who is as capricious and
uncertain as life or death, but who tells De Guiche that he is
the happiest of men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
at least is lying on roses."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so he hastily quitted the
comte's apartments, reproaching himself as he went for having
talked of nothing but his own affairs to De Guiche, and soon
reached D'Artagnan's quarters.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul struck his
forehead with his hand in utter despair.<span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

already."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, you are right,"

going?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

with a smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! a

be off."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Montalais, I suppose - her friend; a woman who, on that account,
will exaggerate all that is either bad or good in the

Montalais, my good fellow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have some reasons

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, I admit it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, in point of fact, why
should I play with you as a cat does with a poor mouse?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You distress me, you do,
indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And if I wish you
not to speak to Montalais just now, it is because you will be
betraying your secret, and people will take advantage of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Wait, if you can."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I cannot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So much the worse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why, you see, Raoul, if I had
an idea, - but I have not got one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Promise me that you
will pity me, my friend, that is all I need, and leave me to get
out of the affair by myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! yes, indeed, in
order that you may get deeper into the mire!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A capital idea, truly! go and sit
down at that table and take a pen in your hand."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What for?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To write
and ask Montalais to give you an interview."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said
Raoul, snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Suddenly the door
opened, and one of the musketeers, approaching D'Artagnan, said,
"Captain, Mademoiselle de Montalais is here, and wishes to speak
to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To me?" murmured
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ask her to
come in; I shall soon see," he said to himself, "whether she
wishes to speak to me or not."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The cunning captain was
quite right in his suspicions; for as soon as Montalais entered
she exclaimed, "Oh, monsieur! monsieur!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I beg your pardon, Monsieur
d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I forgive you, mademoiselle," said
D'Artagnan; "I know that, at my age, those who are looking for me
generally need me for something or another."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was looking for M. de
Bragelonne," replied Montalais.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How very fortunate that
is; he was looking for you, too.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul, will you accompany
Mademoiselle de Montalais?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Go along, then," he
said, as he gently pushed Raoul out of the cabinet; and then,
taking hold of Montalais's hand, he said, in a low voice, "Be
kind towards him; spare him, and spare her, too, if you can."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" she said, in the
same tone of voice, "it is not I who am going to speak to
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Who, then?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is
Madame who has sent for him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good," cried
D'Artagnan, "it is Madame, is it?<span style=

fellow will be cured."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Or else dead," said
Montalais, in a voice full of compassion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Adieu, Monsieur d'Artagnan," she
said; and she ran to join Raoul, who was waiting for her at a
little distance from the door, very much puzzled and thoroughly
uneasy at the dialogue, which promised no good augury for
him.</p>

they will not bring you back any interest."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

dismissed or thrown in to the Bastile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us talk, I tell you, or rather,
do not let us talk at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul clenched his
hands, and tried to assume the look and gait of a man of courage,
it is true, but of a man of courage on his way to the torture
chamber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Montalais,
glancing in every direction, walking along with an easy swinging
gait, and holding up her head pertly in the air, preceded him to
Madame's apartments, where he was at once introduced.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well," he thought, "this day will
pass away without my learning anything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Guiche showed too much consideration
for my feelings; he had no doubt come to an understanding with
Madame, and both of them, by a friendly plot, agreed to postpone
the solution of the problem.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why have I not a determined,
inveterate enemy - that serpent, De Wardes, for instance; that he
would bite, is very likely; but I should not hesitate any
more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To hesitate, to
doubt - better, far, to die."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The next moment Raoul
was in Madame's presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Henrietta, more charming than ever, was half lying, half
reclining in her armchair, her small feet upon an embroidered
velvet cushion; she was playing with a kitten with long silky
fur, which was biting her fingers and hanging by the lace of her
collar.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame seemed plunged in
deep thought, so deep, indeed, that it required both Montalais
and Raoul's voice to disturb her from her reverie.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your highness sent for
me?" repeated Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame shook her head as
if she were just awakening, and then said, "Good morning,
Monsieur de Bragelonne; yes, I sent for you; so you have returned
from England?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, Madame, and am at
your royal highness's commands."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank you; leave us,
Montalais," and the latter immediately left the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You have a few minutes
to give me, Monsieur de Bragelonne, have you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My life is at your
royal highness's disposal," Raoul returned with respect, guessing
that there was something serious in these unusual courtesies; nor
was he displeased, indeed, to observe the seriousness of her
manner, feeling persuaded that there was some sort of affinity
between Madame's sentiments and his own.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, every one at court, of any
perception at all, knew perfectly well the capricious fancy and
absurd despotism of the princess's singular character.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame had been flattered
beyond all bounds by the king's attention; she had made herself
talked about; she had inspired the queen with that mortal
jealousy which is the stinging scorpion at the heel of every
woman's happiness; Madame, in a word, in her attempts to cure a
wounded pride, found that her heart had become deeply and
passionately attached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We
know what Madame had done to recall Raoul, who had been sent out
of the way by Louis XIV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Raoul did not know of her letter to Charles II., although
D'Artagnan had guessed its contents.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Who will undertake to account for
that seemingly inexplicable mixture of love and vanity, that
passionate tenderness of feeling, that prodigious duplicity of
conduct?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No one can,
indeed; not even the bad angel who kindles the love of coquetry
in the heart of a woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Monsieur de Bragelonne," said the princess, after a moment's
pause, "have you returned satisfied?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bragelonne looked at
Madame Henrietta, and seeing how pale she was, not alone from
what she was keeping back, but also from what she was burning to
say, said: "Satisfied! what is there for me to be satisfied or
dissatisfied about, Madame?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But what are those
things with which a man of your age, and of your appearance, is
usually either satisfied or dissatisfied?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How eager she is,"
thought Raoul, almost terrified; "what venom is it she is going
to distil into my heart?" and then, frightened at what she might
possibly be going to tell him, and wishing to put off the
opportunity of having everything explained, which he had hitherto
so ardently wished for, yet had dreaded so much, he replied: "I
left, Madame, a dear friend in good health, and on my return I
find him very ill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You refer to M. de
Guiche," replied Madame Henrietta, with imperturbable
self-possession; "I <i style=

friend of yours."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

he has been wounded; but he is better now.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de Guiche is not to be pitied,"
she said hurriedly; and then, recovering herself, added, "But has
he anything to complain of?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Has he complained of anything?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is there any cause of grief or
sorrow that we are not acquainted with?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I allude only to his
wound, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

then, for, in other respects, M. de Guiche seems to be very
happy; he is always in very high spirits.<span style=

Bragelonne, would far prefer to be, like him, wounded only in the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul started.<span

"she is returning to it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

anything; you disapprove of my observation, then? you are
perfectly satisfied, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Madame," he
said, "your royal highness wishes to say something to me, and
your instinctive kindness and generosity of disposition induce
you to be careful and considerate as to your manner of conveying
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will your royal
highness throw this kind forbearance aside?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am able to bear everything; and I
am listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" replied Henrietta,
"what do you understand, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That which your royal
highness wishes me to understand," said Raoul, trembling,
notwithstanding his command over himself, as he pronounced these
words.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In point of fact,"
murmured the princess&hellip; "it seems cruel, but since I have
begun - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

highness has deigned to begin, will you condescend to finish -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Henrietta rose hurriedly
and walked a few paces up and down her room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What did M. de Guiche tell you?"
she said, suddenly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing!<span style=

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! how well I recognize him in
that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No doubt he wished to
spare me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And that is what
friends call friendship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But surely, M. d'Artagnan, whom you have just left, must have
told you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Henrietta made a gesture
full of impatience, as she said, "At least, you know all the
court knows."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nor the flight to
Chaillot?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul, whose head
dropped like a blossom cut down by the reaper, made an almost
superhuman effort to smile, as he replied with the greatest
gentleness: "I have had the honor of telling your royal highness
that I am absolutely ignorant of everything, that I am a poor
unremembered outcast, who has this moment arrived from
England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There have
rolled so many stormy waves between myself and those I left
behind me here, that the rumor of none of the circumstances your
highness refers to, has been able to reach me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Henrietta was affected
by his extreme pallor, his gentleness, and his great
courage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The principal
feeling in her heart at that moment was an eager desire to hear
the nature of the remembrance which the poor lover retained of
the woman who had made him suffer so much.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur de Bragelonne," she said,
"that which your friends have refused to do, I will do for you,
whom I like and esteem very much.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will be your friend on this
occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You hold your
head high, as a man of honor should; and I deeply regret that you
may have to bow before ridicule, and in a few days, it might be,
contempt."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" exclaimed Raoul,
perfectly livid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It is
as bad as that, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "If you do not know,"
said the princess, "I see that you guess; you were affianced, I
believe, to Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "By that right, you
deserve to be warned about her, as some day or another I shall be
obliged to dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re from my
service - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Dismiss La

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

amenable to the tears and protestations of the king?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, no! my house shall no longer be
made a convenience for such practices; but you tremble, you
cannot stand - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, Madame, no," said
Bragelonne, making an effort over himself; "I thought I should
have died just now, that was all.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your royal highness did me the honor
to say that the king wept and implored you - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, but in vain,"
returned the princess; who then related to Raoul the scene that
took place at Chaillot, and the king's despair on his return; she
told him of his indulgence to herself and the terrible word with
which the outraged princess, the humiliated coquette, had quashed
the royal anger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul stood with his
head bent down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

all?" she said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

replied.</p>

T</span>he princess, preceding Raoul, led him through the
courtyard towards that part of the building La Valli&egrave;re
inhabited, and, ascending the same staircase which Raoul himself
had ascended that very morning, she paused at the door of the
room in which the young man had been so strangely received by
Montalais.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
opportunity was remarkably well chosen to carry out the project
Madame Henrietta had conceived, for the ch&acirc;teau was
empty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, the
courtiers, and the ladies of the court, had set off for
Saint-Germain; Madame Henrietta was the only one who knew of
Bragelonne's return, and thinking over the advantages which might
be drawn from this return, she had feigned indisposition in order
to remain behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Madame
was therefore confident of finding La Valli&egrave;re's room and
Saint-Aignan's apartment perfectly empty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She took a pass-key from her pocket
and opened the door of her maid of honor's apartment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bragelonne's gaze was immediately
fixed upon the interior of the room, which he recognized at once;
and the impression which the sight of it produced upon him was
torture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The princess
looked at him, and her practiced eye at once detected what was
passing in the young man's heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You asked for proofs,"
she said; "do not be astonished, then, if I give you them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But if you do not think you
have courage enough to confront them, there is still time to
withdraw."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I thank you, Madame,"
said Bragelonne; "but I came here to be convinced.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You promised to convince me, - do
so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Enter, then," said
Madame, "and shut the door behind you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bragelonne obeyed, and
then turned towards the princess, whom he interrogated by a
look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You know where you are,
I suppose?" inquired Madame Henrietta.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Everything leads me to
believe I am in Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re's room."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"But I would
observe to your highness, that this room is a room, and is not a
proof."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Wait," said the
princess, as she walked to the foot of the bed, folded up the
screen into its several compartments, and stooped down towards
the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Look here,"
she continued; "stoop down and lift up this trap-door
yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A trap-door!" said
Raoul, astonished; for D'Artagnan's words began to return to his
memory, and he had an indistinct recollection that D'Artagnan had
made use of the same word.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He looked, but uselessly, for some
cleft or crevice which might indicate an opening or a ring to
assist in lifting up the planking.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah, I forgot,"
said Madame Henrietta, "I forgot the secret spring; the fourth
plank of the flooring, - press on the spot where you will observe
a knot in the wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Those
are the instructions; press, vicomte! press, I say,
yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul, pale as
death, pressed his finger on the spot which had been indicated to
him; at the same moment the spring began to work, and the trap
rose of its own accord.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is ingenious
enough, certainly," said the princess; "and one can see that the
architect foresaw that a woman's hand only would have to make use
of this spring, for see how easily the trap-door opened without
assistance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A staircase!"
cried Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, and a very pretty
one, too," said Madame Henrietta.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "See, vicomte, the staircase has a
balustrade, intended to prevent the falling of timid persons, who
might be tempted to descend the staircase; and I will risk myself
on it accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come,
vicomte, follow me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But before following
you, madame, may I ask where this staircase leads to?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, true; I forgot to
tell you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You know,
perhaps, that formerly M. de Saint-Aignan lived in the very next
apartment to the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, Madame, I am aware
of that; that was the arrangement, at least, before I left; and
more than once I had the honor of visiting his rooms."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, he obtained the
king's leave to change his former convenient and beautiful
apartment for the two rooms to which this staircase will conduct
us, and which together form a lodging for him half the size, and
at ten times greater the distance from the king, - a close
proximity to whom is by no means disdained, in general, by the
gentlemen belonging to the court."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good, Madame,"
returned Raoul; "but go on, I beg, for I do not understand
yet."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, then it
accidentally happened," continued the princess, "that M. de
Saint-Aignan's apartment is situated underneath the apartments of
my maids of honor, and by a further coincidence, exactly
underneath the room of La Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But what was the motive
of this trap-door and this staircase?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That I cannot tell
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Would you like to go
down to Monsieur de Saint-Aignan's rooms?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Perhaps we shall be able to find the
solution of the enigma there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And Madame set the
example by going down herself, while Raoul, sighing deeply,
followed her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At every
step Bragelonne took, he advanced further into that mysterious
apartment which had witnessed La Valli&egrave;re's sighs and
still retained the perfume of her presence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Bragelonne fancied he perceived, as
he inhaled the atmosphere, that the young girl must have passed
through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then succeeded
to these emanations of herself, which he regarded as invisible
though certain proofs, flowers she preferred to all others -
books of her own selection.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If Raoul retained a single doubt on
the subject, it would have vanished at the secret harmony of
tastes and connection of the mind with the ordinary objects of
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La Valli&egrave;re,
in Bragelonne's eyes, was present there in each article of
furniture, in the color of the hangings, in all that surrounded
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Dumb, and now
completely overwhelmed, there was nothing further for him now to
learn, and he followed his pitiless conductress as blindly as the
culprit follows the executioner; while Madame, as cruel as women
of overstrung temperaments generally are, did not spare him the
slightest detail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it
must be admitted that, notwithstanding the kind of apathy into
which he had fallen, none of these details, even had he been left
alone, would have escaped him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The happiness of the woman who
loves, when that happiness is derived from a rival, is a living
torture for a jealous man; but for a jealous man such as Raoul
was, for one whose heart for the first time in its existence was
being steeped in gall and bitterness, Louise's happiness was in
reality an ignominious death, a death of body and soul.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He guessed all; he fancied he
could see them, with their hands clasped in each other's, their
faces drawn close together, and reflected, side by side, in
loving proximity, and they gazed upon the mirrors around them -
so sweet an occupation for lovers, who, as they thus see
themselves twice over, imprint the picture still more deeply on
their memories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He could
guess, too, the stolen kiss snatched as they separated from each
other's loved society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The luxury, the studied elegance, eloquent of the perfection of
indolence, of ease; the extreme care shown, either to spare the
loved object every annoyance, or to occasion her a delightful
surprise; that might and majesty of love multiplied by the
majesty and might of royalty itself, seemed like a death-blow to
Raoul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If there be
anything which can in any way assuage or mitigate the tortures of
jealousy, it is the inferiority of the man who is preferred to
yourself; whilst, on the very contrary, if there be one anguish
more bitter than another, a misery for which language lacks a
word, it is the superiority of the man preferred to yourself,
superior, perhaps, in youth, beauty, grace.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is in such moments as these that
Heaven almost seems to have taken part against the disdained and
rejected lover.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> One final pang was
reserved for poor Raoul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Madame Henrietta lifted up a silk curtain, and behind the canvas
he perceived La Valli&egrave;re's portrait.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Not only the portrait of La
Valli&egrave;re, but of La Valli&egrave;re radiant with youth,
beauty, and happiness, inhaling life and enjoyment at every pore,
because at eighteen years of age love itself is life.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Louise!" murmured
Bragelonne, - "Louise! is it true, then?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, you have never loved me, for
never have you looked at me in that manner."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he felt as if his heart were
crushed within his bosom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Madame Henrietta looked
at him, almost envious of his extreme grief, although she well
knew there was nothing to envy in it, and that she herself was as
passionately loved by De Guiche as Louise by Bragelonne.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul interpreted Madame
Henrietta's look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, forgive me, forgive
me, Madame; in your presence I know I ought to have greater
self-control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Heaven
grant that you may never be struck by similar misery to that
which crushes me at this moment, for you are but a woman, and
would not be able to endure so terrible an affliction.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Forgive me, I again entreat
you, Madame; I am but a man without rank or position, while you
belong to a race whose happiness knows no bounds, whose power
acknowledges no limit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur de
Bragelonne," replied Henrietta, "a mind such as your merits all
the consideration and respect which a queen's heart even can
bestow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Regard me as your
friend, monsieur; and as such, indeed, I would not allow your
whole life to be poisoned by perfidy, and covered with
ridicule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was I,
indeed, who, with more courage than any of your pretended
friends, - I except M. de Guiche, - was the cause of your return
from London; it is I, also, who now give you the melancholy
proofs, necessary, however, for your cure if you are a lover with
courage in his heart, and not a weeping Amadis.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not thank me; pity me, even, and
do not serve the king less faithfully than you have done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul smiled
bitterly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! true,
true; I was forgetting that; the king is my master."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your liberty, nay, your
very life, is in danger."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> A steady, penetrating
look informed Madame Henrietta that she was mistaken, and that
her last argument was not a likely one to affect the young
man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Take care, Monsieur
de Bragelonne," she said, "for if you do not weigh well all your
actions, you might throw into an extravagance of wrath a prince
whose passions, once aroused, exceed the bounds of reason, and
you would thereby involve your friends and family in the deepest
distress; you must bend, you must submit, and you must cure
yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I thank you, Madame; I
appreciate the advice your royal highness is good enough to give
me, and I will endeavor to follow it; but one final word, I
beg."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Name it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Should I be indiscreet
in asking you the secret of this staircase, of this trap-door; a
secret, which, it seems, you have discovered?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing more
simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For the purpose
of exercising a surveillance over the young girls who are
attached to my service, I have duplicate keys of their
doors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It seemed very
strange to me that M. de Saint-Aignan should change his
apartments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It seemed
very strange that the king should come to see M. de Saint-Aignan
every day, and, finally, it seemed very strange that so many
things should be done during your absence, that the very habits
and customs of the court appeared changed.<span style=

the king, nor to serve as a cloak for his love affairs; for after
La Valli&egrave;re, who weeps incessantly, he will take a fancy

Tonnay-Charente, who does nothing but sing all day; to act such a

slipped it into the lock of the door which communicated with the
room set apart for the two lovers, and satisfied himself that the
missive was so apparent that Saint-Aignan could not but see it as
he entered; he rejoined the princess, who had already reached the
top of the staircase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
They then separated, Raoul pretending to thank her highness;
Henrietta pitying, or seeming to pity, with all her heart, the
wretched young man she had just condemned to such fearful
torture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh!" she said,
as she saw him disappear, pale as death, and his eyes bursting

T</span>he great number of individuals we have introduced into
this long story is the reason why each of them has been forced to
appear only in turn, according to the exigencies of the
recital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The result is,
that our readers have had no opportunity of meeting our friend
Porthos since his return from Fontainebleau.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The honors which he had received
from the king had not changed the easy, affectionate character of
that excellent-hearted man; he may, perhaps, have held up his
head a little higher than usual, and a majesty of demeanor, as it
were, may have betrayed itself since the honor of dining at the
king's table had been accorded him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His majesty's banqueting-room had
produced a certain effect on Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Le Seigneur de Bracieux et de
Pierrefonds delighted to remember that, during that memorable
dinner, the numerous array of servants, and the large number of
officials in attendance on the guests, gave a certain tone and
effect to the repast, and seemed, as it were, to furnish the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos undertook
to confer upon Mouston a position of some kind or other, in order
to establish a sort of hierarchy among his other domestics, and
to create a military household, which was not unusual among the
great captains of the age, since, in the preceding century, this
luxury had been greatly encouraged by Messieurs de
Tr&eacute;ville, de Schomberg, de la Vieuville, without alluding
to M. de Richelieu, M. de Cond&eacute;, and de
Bouillon-Turenne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And,
therefore, why should not he, Porthos, the friend of the king,
and of M. Fouquet, a baron, and engineer, etc., why should not
he, indeed, enjoy all the delightful privileges which large
possessions and unusual merit invariably confer?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Somewhat neglected by Aramis, who,
we know, was greatly occupied with M. Fouquet; neglected, also,
on account of his being on duty, by D'Artagnan; tired of
Tr&uuml;chen and Planchet, Porthos was surprised to find himself
dreaming, without precisely knowing why; but if any one had said
to him, "Do you want anything, Porthos?" he would most certainly
have replied, "Yes."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
After one of those dinners, during which Porthos attempted to
recall to his recollection all the details of the royal banquet,
gently joyful, thanks to the excellence of the wines; gently
melancholy, thanks to his ambitions ideas, Porthos was gradually
falling off into a placid doze, when his servant entered to
announce that M. de Bragelonne wished to speak to him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos passed into an
adjoining room, where he found his young friend in the
disposition of mind we are already aware of.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul advanced towards Porthos, and
shook him by the hand; Porthos, surprised at his seriousness of
aspect, offered him a seat.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Dear M. du Vallon," said Raoul, "I
have a service to ask of you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing could happen
more fortunately, my young friend," replied Porthos; "I have
eight thousand livres sent me this morning from Pierrefonds; and
if you want any money - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, I thank you; it is
not money."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So much the worse,
then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have always heard
it said that that is the rarest service, but the easiest to
render.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The remark struck
me; I like to cite remarks that strike me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your heart is as good
as your mind is sound and true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are much too kind,
I declare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will dine
here, of course?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; I am
not hungry."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh! not dine?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What a dreadful country
England is!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not too much so, indeed
- but - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, if such excellent
fish and meat were not to be procured there, it would hardly be
endurable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, I came to - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am listening.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only just allow me to take a
little sip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One gets
thirsty in Paris;" and he ordered a bottle of champagne to be
brought; and, having first filled Raoul's glass, he filled his
own, drank it down at a gulp, and then resumed: "I needed that,
in order to listen to you with proper attention.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am now entirely at your
service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What do you wish
to ask me, dear Raoul?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
What do you want?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Give me your opinion on
quarrels in general, my dear friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "My opinion!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well - but - Explain your idea a
little more coherently," replied Porthos, rubbing his
forehead.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I mean - you are
generally good-humored, good-tempered, whenever any
misunderstanding arises between a friend of yours and a stranger,
for instance?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! in the
best of tempers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good; but what do
you do, in such a case?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whenever any friend of
mine gets into a quarrel, I always act on one principle."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That lost time is
irreparable, and one never arranges an affair so well as when
everything has been done to embroil the disputants as much as
possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! indeed, is that the
principle on which you proceed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Precisely; so, as soon
as a quarrel takes place, I bring the two parties together."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Exactly."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You
understand that by this means it is impossible for an affair not
to be arranged."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should have thought
that, treated in this manner, an affair would, on the contrary -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! not the least in
the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Just fancy,
now, I have had in my life something like a hundred and eighty to
a hundred and ninety regular duels, without reckoning hasty
encounters, or chance meetings."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is a
very handsome aggregate," said Raoul, unable to resist a
smile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "A mere nothing; but I
am so gentle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
reckons his duels by hundreds.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is very true he is a little too
hard and sharp - I have often told him so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And so," resumed Raoul,
"you generally arrange the affairs of honor your friends confide
to you."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There is
not a single instance in which I have not finished by arranging
every one of them," said Porthos, with a gentleness and
confidence that surprised Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But the way in which
you settle them is at least honorable, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! rely upon that; and
at this stage, I will explain my other principle to you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as my friend has
intrusted his quarrel to me, this is what I do; I go to his
adversary at once, armed with a politeness and self-possession
absolutely requisite under such circumstances."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is the way, then,"
said Raoul, bitterly, "that you arrange affairs so safely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I believe you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I go to the adversary, then,
and say to him: 'It is impossible, monsieur, that you are
ignorant of the extent to which you have insulted my
friend.'"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul frowned
at this remark.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It sometimes happens -
very often, indeed," pursued Porthos - "that my friend has not
been insulted at all; he has even been the first to give offense;
you can imagine, therefore, whether my language is or is not well
chosen."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And Porthos
burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Decidedly," said Raoul
to himself while the merry thunder of Porthos's laughter was
resounding in his ears, "I am very unfortunate.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> De Guiche treats me with coolness,
D'Artagnan with ridicule, Porthos is too tame; no one will settle
this affair in the only way I wish it to be settled.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And I came to Porthos because I
wanted to find a sword instead of cold reasoning at my
service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My ill-luck dogs
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos, who had
recovered himself, continued: "By one simple expression, I leave
my adversary without an excuse."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is as it may
happen," said Raoul, absently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not at all, it is quite
certain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have not left
him an excuse; and then it is that I display all my courtesy, in
order to attain the happy issue of my project.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I advance, therefore, with an air of
great politeness, and taking my adversary by the hand, I say to
him: 'Now that you are convinced of having given the offense, we
are sure of reparation; between my friend and yourself, the
future can only offer an exchange of mutual courtesies of
conduct, and consequently, my mission now is to acquaint you with
the length of my friend's sword.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What!" said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Wait a minute.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> 'The length of my friend's
sword.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My horse is
waiting below; my friend is in such and such a spot and is
impatiently awaiting your agreeable society; I will take you with
me; we can call upon your second as we go along:' and the affair
is arranged."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And so," said Raoul,
pale with vexation, "you reconcile the two adversaries on the
ground."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I beg your pardon,"
interrupted Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Reconcile!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What
for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You said that the
affair was arranged."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of course! since my
friend is waiting for him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! what then?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he is waiting - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well! if he is waiting,
it is merely to stretch his legs a little.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The adversary, on the contrary, is
stiff from riding; they place themselves in proper order, and my
friend kills the opponent, and the affair is ended."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! he kills him,
then?" cried Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should think so,"
said Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Is it
likely I should ever have as a friend a man who allows himself to
get killed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have a
hundred and one friends; at the head of the list stand your
father, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, all of whom are living and well,
I believe?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, my dear baron,"
exclaimed Raoul, as he embraced Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You approve of my
method, then?" said the giant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

thoroughly, that I shall have recourse to it this very day,
without a moment's delay, - at once, in fact.<span style=

looking for."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

politeness in return, even if it had not happened to be my usual
custom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So, he has given

not quite understand me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>

men of the present day - Bah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I would carry him off bodily, if
that were all," and Porthos, adding gesture to speech, lifted
Raoul and the chair he was sitting on off the ground, and carried
them round the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good," said Raoul,
laughing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "All we have to

it seems."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

troublesome all this is!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
In former days we had no occasion to say anything about the
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> People fought for

that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

du Vallon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"However, tell me
what<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> the cause
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is too long a
story to tell; only, as one must particularize to a certain
extent, and as, on the other hand, the affair is full of
difficulties, and requires the most absolute secrecy, you will
have the kindness merely to tell M. de Saint-Aignan that he has,
in the first place, insulted me by changing his lodgings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"By changing his
lodgings?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Good," said
Porthos, who began to count on his fingers; "next?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Then in getting a
trap-door made in his new apartments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I understand,"
said Porthos; "a trap-door: upon my word, that is very serious;
you ought to be furious at that.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What the deuce does the fellow mean
by getting trap-doors made without first consulting you?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Trap-doors! <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>mordioux!</i><span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I haven't got any, except in my
dungeons at Bracieux."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And you will
please add," said Raoul, "that my last motive for considering
myself insulted is, the existence of the portrait that M. de
Saint-Aignan well knows."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Is it
possible?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A portrait,
too!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A change of
residence, a trap-door, and a portrait!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why, my dear friend, with but one of
these causes of complaint there is enough, and more than enough,
for all the gentlemen in France and Spain to cut each other's
throats, and that is saying but very little."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, my dear
friend, you are furnished with all you need, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I shall take a
second horse with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Select your own rendezvous, and while you are waiting there, you
can practice some of the best passes, so as to get your limbs as
elastic as possible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Thank you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall be waiting for you in
the wood of Vincennes, close to Minimes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"All goes well,
then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where am I to find
this M. de Saint-Aignan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At the Palais
Royal."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos ran a huge
hand-bell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "My court
suit," he said to the servant who answered the summons, "my
horse, and a led horse to accompany me."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then turning to Raoul, as soon as
the servant had quitted the room, he said: "Does your father know
anything about this?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No; I am going to
write to him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And
D'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, nor D'Artagnan
either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He is very
cautions, you know, and might have diverted me from my
purpose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"D'Artagnan is a
sound adviser, though," said Porthos, astonished that, in his own
loyal faith in D'Artagnan, any one could have thought of himself,
so long as there was a D'Artagnan in the world.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Dear M. du
Vallon," said Raoul, "do not question me any more, I implore
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have told you all
that I had to say; it is prompt action I now expect, sharp and
decided as you know how to arrange it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That, indeed, is my reason for
having chosen you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will be
satisfied with me," replied Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do not forget,
either, that, except ourselves, no one must know anything of this
meeting."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"People generally
find these things out," said Porthos, dryly, "when a dead body is
discovered in a wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
I promise everything, my dear friend, except the concealment of
the dead body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There it
is, and it must be seen, as a matter of course.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is a principle of mine, not to
bury bodies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That has a
smack of the assassin about it.<span style=

said the giant, finishing the bottle, while a servant spread out
upon a sofa the gorgeously decorated dress trimmed with lace.</p>

P</span>orthos, intrusted, to his great delight, with this
mission, which made him feel young again, took half an hour less
than his usual time to put on his court suit.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To show that he was a man acquainted
with the usages of high society, he had begun by sending his
lackey to inquire if Monsieur de Saint-Aignan were at home, and
heard, in answer, that M. le Comte de Saint-Aignan had had the
honor of accompanying the king to Saint-Germain, as well as the
whole court; but that monsieur le comte had just that moment
returned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Immediately
upon this reply, Porthos made as much haste as possible, and
reached Saint-Aignan's apartments just as the latter was having
his boots taken off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
promenade had been delightful.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, who was in love more than
ever, and of course happier than ever, behaved in the most
charming manner to every one.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing could possibly equal his
kindness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de
Saint-Aignan, it may be remembered, was a poet, and fancied that
he had proved that he was so under too many a memorable
circumstance to allow the title to be disputed by any one.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An indefatigable rhymester, he
had, during the whole of the journey, overwhelmed with quatrains,
sextains, and madrigals, first the king, and then La
Valli&egrave;re.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
king, on his side, was in a similarly poetical mood, and had made
a distich; while La Valli&egrave;re, delighting in poetry, as
most women do who are in love, had composed two sonnets.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The day, then, had not been a
bad one for Apollo; and so, as soon as he had returned to Paris,
Saint-Aignan, who knew beforehand that his verse would be sure to
be extensively circulated in court circles, occupied himself,
with a little more attention than he had been able to bestow
during the promenade, with the composition, as well as with the
idea itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Consequently, with all the tenderness of a father about to start
his children in life, he candidly interrogated himself whether
the public would find these offsprings of his imagination
sufficiently elegant and graceful; and in order to make his mind
easy on the subject, M. de Saint-Aignan recited to himself the
madrigal he had composed, and which he had repeated from memory
to the king, and had promised to write out for him on his
return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All the time he
was committing these words to memory, the comte was engaged in
undressing himself more completely.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had just taken off his coat, and
was putting on his dressing-gown, when he was informed that
Monsieur le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds was
waiting to be received.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Eh!" he said, "what
does that bunch of names mean?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I don't know anything about
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is the same
gentleman," replied the lackey, "who had the honor of dining with
you, monseigneur, at the king's table, when his majesty was
staying at Fontainebleau."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Introduce him, then, at
once," cried Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos, in a few
minutes, entered the room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de Saint-Aignan had an excellent
recollection of persons, and, at the first glance, he recognized
the gentleman from the country, who enjoyed so singular a
reputation, and whom the king had received so favorably at
Fontainebleau, in spite of the smiles of some of those who were
present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He therefore
advanced towards Porthos with all the outward signs of
consideration of manner which Porthos thought but natural,
considering that he himself, whenever he called upon an
adversary, hoisted a standard of the most refined
politeness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan
desired the servant to give Porthos a chair; and the latter, who
saw nothing unusual in this act of politeness, sat down gravely
and coughed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The ordinary
courtesies having been exchanged between the two gentlemen, the
comte, to whom the visit was paid, said, "May I ask, monsieur le
baron, to what happy circumstance I am indebted for the favor of
a visit from you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The very thing I am
about to have the honor of explaining to you, monsieur le comte;
but, I beg your pardon - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is the matter,
monsieur?" inquired Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I regret to say that I
have broken your chair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Not at all, monsieur,"
said Saint-Aignan; "not at all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is the fact, though,
monsieur le comte; I have broken it - so much so, indeed, that if
I do not move, I shall fall down, which would be an exceedingly
disagreeable position for me in the discharge of the very serious
mission which has been intrusted to me with regard to
yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos rose; and but
just in time, for the chair had given way several inches.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan looked about him
for something more solid for his guest to sit upon.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Modern articles of
furniture," said Porthos, while the comte was looking about, "are
constructed in a ridiculously flimsy manner.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In my early days, when I used to sit
down with far more energy than is now the case, I do not remember
ever to have broken a chair, except in taverns, with my
arms."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Saint-Aignan smiled at
this remark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But," said
Porthos, as he settled himself down on a couch, which creaked,
but did not give way beneath his weight, "that unfortunately has
nothing whatever to do with my present visit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Why unfortunately?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you the bearer of a
message of ill-omen, monsieur le baron?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Of ill-omen - for a
gentleman?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Certainly not,
monsieur le comte," replied Porthos, nobly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I have simply come to say that you
have seriously insulted a friend of mine."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I, monsieur?" exclaimed
Saint-Aignan - "I have insulted a friend of yours, do you
say?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> May I ask his
name?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. Raoul de
Bragelonne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have insulted M.
Raoul de Bragelonne!" cried Saint-Aignan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I really assure you, monsieur, that
it is quite impossible; for M. de Bragelonne, whom I know but
very slightly, - nay, whom I know hardly at all - is in England,
and, as I have not seen him for a long time past, I cannot
possibly have insulted him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "M. de Bragelonne is in
Paris, monsieur le comte," said Porthos, perfectly unmoved; "and
I repeat, it is quite certain you have insulted him, since he
himself told me you had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Yes, monsieur, you have seriously insulted him, mortally insulted
him, I repeat."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It is impossible,
monsieur le baron, I swear, quite impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Besides," added
Porthos, "you cannot be ignorant of the circumstance, since M. de
Bragelonne informed me that he had already apprised you of it by
a note."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I give you my word of
honor, monsieur, that I have received no note whatever."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

extraordinary," replied Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I will convince you,"
said Saint-Aignan, "that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
have received nothing in any way from him."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he rang the bell.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Basque," he said to the servant who
entered, "how many letters have or notes were sent here during my
absence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Three, monsieur le
comte - a note from M. de Fiesque, one from Madame de
Lafert&eacute;, and a letter from M. de las Fuent&egrave;s."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is that all?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak the truth before

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "There was a note, also,

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Well, from
whom?"<br>
"From Mademoiselle - de - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"De Laval."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"That is quite

"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I believe you, monsieur le
comte."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan
dismissed the valet, and followed him to the door, in order to
close it after him; and when he had done so, looking straight
before him, he happened to see in the keyhole of the adjoining
apartment the paper which Bragelonne had slipped in there as he
left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What is this?" he
said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos, who was
sitting with his back to the room, turned round.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Aha!" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A note in the
keyhole!" exclaimed Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is not
unlikely to be the missing letter, monsieur le comte," said
Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan took
out the paper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A note
from M. de Bragelonne!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You see, monsieur,
I was right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, when I
say a thing - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Brought here by M.

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "This is infamous!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How could he possibly have come
here?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the comte rang
again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Who has been here
during my absence with the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No one,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is
impossible!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Some one must
have been here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No one could
possibly have entered, monsieur, since the keys have never left
my pocket."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And yet I find the
letter in yonder lock; some one must have put it there; it could
not have come here of its own accord."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Basque opened his
arms as if signifying the most absolute ignorance on the
subject.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Probably it was M.
de Bragelonne himself who placed it there," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In that case he
must have entered here."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How could that
have been, since I have the key in my own pocket?" returned
Basque, perseveringly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan
crumpled the letter in his palm, after having read it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "There is something mysterious
about this," he murmured, absorbed in thought.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos left him to his reflections;
but after a while returned to the mission he had undertaken.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Shall we return to
our little affair?" Porthos resumed, addressing Saint-Aignan
after a brief pause.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I think I can now
understand it, from this note, which has arrived here in so
singular a manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Monsieur de Bragelonne says that a friend will call."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am his

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"For the purpose of
giving me a challenge?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Precisely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And he complains
that I have insulted him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Mortally."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In what way, may I
ask; for his conduct is so mysterious, that, at least, it needs
some explanation?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur," replied
Porthos, "my friend cannot but be right; and, as far as his
conduct is concerned, if it be mysterious, as you say, you have
only yourself to blame for it."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos pronounced these words with
an amount of confidence which, for a man who was unaccustomed to
his ways, must have revealed an infinity of sense.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Mystery, so be it;
but what is all the mystery about?" said Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will think it
the best, perhaps," Porthos replied, with a low bow, "if I do not
enter in to particulars."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, I perfectly
understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We will touch
very lightly upon it, then, so speak, monsieur, I am
listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In the first
place, monsieur," said Porthos, "you have changed your
apartments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, that is quite
true," said Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You admit it,"
said Porthos, with an air of satisfaction.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Admit it! of
course I admit it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why
should I not admit it, do you suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You have admitted
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Very good," said
Porthos, lifting up one finger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But how can my
having moved my lodgings have done M. de Bragelonne any
harm?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have the goodness
to tell me that, for I positively do not comprehend a word of
what you are saying."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos stopped
him, and then said, with great gravity, "Monsieur, this is the
first of M. de Bragelonne's complaints against you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he makes a complaint, it is
because he feels himself insulted."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan began
to beat his foot impatiently on the ground.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "This looks like a spurious
quarrel," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No one can
possibly have a spurious quarrel with the Vicomte de Bragelonne,"
returned Porthos; "but, at all events, you have nothing to add on
the subject of your changing your apartments, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nothing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And what is the next
point?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah, the next!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will observe, monsieur,
that the one I have already mentioned is a most serious injury,
to which you have given no answer, or rather, have answered very
indifferently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it
possible, monsieur, that you have changed your lodgings?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. de Bragelonne feels
insulted at your having done so, and you do not attempt to excuse
yourself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What!" cried
Saint-Aignan, who was getting annoyed at the perfect coolness of
his visitor - "what! am I to consult M. de Bragelonne whether I
am to move or not?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You
can hardly be serious, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And it is absolutely necessary,
monsieur; but under any circumstances, you will admit that it is
nothing in comparison with the second ground of complaint."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, what is
that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos assumed a
very solemn expression as he said: "How about the trap-door,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan turned
exceedingly pale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
pushed back his chair so abruptly, that Porthos, simple as he
was, perceived that the blow had told.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The trap-door," murmured
Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, monsieur,
explain that if you can," said Porthos, shaking his head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan held
down his head, as he murmured: "I have been betrayed, everything
is known!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Everything,"
replied Porthos, who knew nothing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You see me
perfectly overwhelmed," pursued Saint-Aignan, "overwhelmed to a
degree that I hardly know what I am about."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A guilty
conscience, monsieur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Your affair is a bad one, and when the public learns all about
it, it will judge - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, monsieur!"
exclaimed the count, hurriedly, "such a secret ought not to be
known even by one's confessor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That we will think
about," said Porthos; "the secret will not go far, in fact."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Surely, monsieur,"
returned Saint-Aignan, "since M. de Bragelonne has penetrated the
secret, he must be aware of the danger he as well as others run
the risk of incurring."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"M. de Bragelonne
runs no danger, monsieur, nor does he fear any either, as you, if
it please Heaven, will find out very soon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"This fellow is a
perfect madman," thought Saint-Aignan.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What, in Heaven's name, does he
want?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then said
aloud: "Come, monsieur, let us hush up this affair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You forget the
portrait," said Porthos, in a voice of thunder, which made the
comte's blood freeze in his veins.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>As the portrait in
question was La Valli&egrave;re's portrait, and no mistake could
any longer exist on the subject, Saint-Aignan's eyes were
completely opened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah!"
he exclaimed - "ah! monsieur, I remember now that M. de
Bragelonne was engaged to be married to her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos assumed an
imposing air, all the majesty of ignorance, in fact, as he said:
"It matters nothing whatever to me, nor to yourself, indeed,
whether or not my friend was, as you say, engaged to be
married.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am even
astonished that you should have made use of so indiscreet a
remark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It may possibly
do your cause harm, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur," replied
Saint-Aignan, "you are the incarnation of intelligence, delicacy,
and loyalty of feeling united.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I see the whole matter now clearly
enough."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So much the
better," said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And," pursued
Saint-Aignan, "you have made me comprehend it in the most
ingenious and the most delicate manner possible.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I beg you to accept my best
thanks."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos drew
himself up, unable to resist the flattery of the remark.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Only, now that I know
everything, permit me to explain - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos shook his
head, as a an who does not wish to hear, but Saint-Aignan
continued: "I am in despair, I assure you, at all that has
happened; but how would you have acted in my place?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Come, between ourselves, tell me
what you would have done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos drew
himself up as he answered: "There is now no question of all of
what I should have done, young man; you have been made acquainted
with the three causes of complaint against you, I believe?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As for the first,
my change of rooms, and I now address myself to you as a man of
honor and of great intelligence, could I, when the desire of so
august a personage was so urgently expressed that I should move,
ought I to have disobeyed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos was about
to speak, but Saint-Aignan did not give him time to answer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Ah! my frankness, I see,
convinces you," he said, interpreting the movement according to
his own fancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You feel
that I am right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos did not
reply, and so Saint-Aignan continued: "I pass by that unfortunate
trap-door," he said, placing his hand on Porthos's arm, "that
trap-door, the occasion and means of so much unhappiness, and
which was constructed for - you know what.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, then, in plain truth, do you
suppose that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> it was I
who, of my own accord, in such a place, too, had that trap-door
made? - Oh, no! - you do not believe it; and here, again, you
feel, you guess, you understand the influence of a will superior
to my own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You can
conceive the infatuation, the blind, irresistible passion which
has been at work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But,
thank Heaven!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am
fortunate in speaking to a man who has so much sensitiveness of
feeling; and if it were not so, indeed, what an amount of misery
and scandal would fall upon her, poor girl! and upon him - whom I
will not name."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos, confused
and bewildered by the eloquence and gestures of Saint-Aignan,
made a thousand efforts to stem this torrent of words, of which,
by the by, he did not understand a single one; he remained
upright and motionless on his seat, and that was all he could
do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan
continued, and gave a new inflection to his voice, and an
increasing vehemence to his gesture: "As for the portrait, for I
readily believe the portrait is the principal cause of complaint,
tell me candidly if you think me to blame? - Who was it who
wished to have her portrait?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Was it I? - Who is in love with
her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is it I? - Who
wishes to gain her affection?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Again, is it I? - Who took her
likeness?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I, do you
think?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No! a thousand
times no!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know M. de
Bragelonne must be in a state of despair; I know these
misfortunes are most cruel.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I, too, am suffering as well;
and yet there is no possibility of offering any resistance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Suppose we were to fight? we
would be laughed at.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If
he obstinately persist in his course, he is lost.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will tell me, I know, that
despair is ridiculous, but then you are a sensible man.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have understood me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I perceived by your serious,
thoughtful, embarrassed air, even, that the importance of the
situation we are placed in has not escaped you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Return, therefore, to M. de
Bragelonne; thank him - as I have indeed reason to thank him -
for having chosen as an intermediary a man of your high
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Believe me that I
shall, on my side, preserve an eternal gratitude for the man who
has so ingeniously, so cleverly arranged the misunderstanding
between us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And since ill
luck would have it that the secret should be known to four
instead of three, why, this secret, which might make the most
ambitious man's fortune, I am delighted to share with you,
monsieur, from the bottom of my heart I am delighted at it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From this very moment you can
make use of me as you please, I place myself entirely at your
mercy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What can I
possibly do for you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What
can I solicit, nay, require even?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You have only to speak, monsieur,
only to speak."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And, according to
the familiarly friendly fashion of that period, Saint-Aignan
threw his arms round Porthos, and clasped him tenderly in his
embrace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos allowed
him to do this with the most perfect indifference.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Speak," resumed Saint-Aignan, "what
do you require?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur," said
Porthos, "I have a horse below: be good enough to mount him; he
is a very good one and will play you no tricks."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Mount on
horseback! what for?" inquired Saint-Aignan, with no little
curiosity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To accompany me to
where M. de Bragelonne is waiting us."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! he wishes to
speak to me, I suppose?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
can well believe that; he wishes to have the details, very
likely; alas! it is a very delicate matter; but at the present
moment I cannot, for the king is waiting for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The king must
wait, then" said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you say?
the king must wait!" interrupted the finished courtier, with a
smile of utter amazement, for he could not understand that the
king could under any circumstances be supposed to have to
wait.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is merely the
affair of a very short hour," returned Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But where is M. de
Bragelonne waiting for me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At the Minimes, at
Vincennes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah, indeed! but
are we going to laugh over the affair when we get there?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I don't think it
likely," said Porthos, as his face assumed a look of utter
hardness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But the Minimes is
a rendezvous where duels take place, and what can I have to do at
the Minimes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos slowly drew
his sword, and said: "That is the length of my friend's
sword."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, the man is
mad!" cried Saint-Aignan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The color mounted
to Porthos's face, as he replied: "If I had not the honor of
being in your own apartment, monsieur, and of representing M. de
Bragelonne's interests, I would throw you out of the window.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It will be merely a pleasure
postponed, and you will lose nothing by waiting.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will you come with me to the
Minimes, monsieur, of your own free will?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Take care, I will
carry you if you do not come quickly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Basque!" cried
Saint-Aignan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as
Basque appeared, he said, "The king wishes to see monsieur le
comte."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is very
different," said Porthos; "the king's service before anything
else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We will wait until
this evening, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And saluting
Saint-Aignan with his usual courtesy, Porthos left the room,
delighted at having arranged another affair.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan looked after him as he
left; and then hastily putting on his court dress again, he ran
off, arranging his costume as he went along, muttering to
himself, "The Minimes! the Minimes!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We shall see how the king will fancy
this challenge; for it is for him after all, that is
certain."</p>

O</span>n his return from the promenade, which had been so
prolific in poetical effusions, and in which every one had paid
his or her tribute to the Muses, as the poets of the period used
to say, the king found M. Fouquet waiting for an audience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Colbert had lain in wait
for his majesty in the corridor, and followed him like a jealous
and watchful shadow; M. Colbert, with his square head, his vulgar
and untidy, though rich costume, somewhat resembled a Flemish
gentleman after he had been over-indulging in his national drink
- beer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet, at sight
of his enemy, remained perfectly unmoved, and during the whole of
the scene which followed scrupulously resolved to observe a line
of conduct particularly difficult to the man of superior mind,
who does not even wish to show his contempt, for fear of doing
his adversary too much honor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert made no attempt to conceal
his insolent expression of the vulgar joy he felt.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In his opinion, M. Fouquet's was a
game very badly played and hopelessly lost, although not yet
finished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert
belonged to that school of politicians who think cleverness alone
worthy of their admiration, and success the only thing worth
caring for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert,
moreover, who was not simply an envious and jealous man, but who
had the king's interest really at heart, because he was
thoroughly imbued with the highest sense of probity in all
matters of figures and accounts, could well afford to assign as a
pretext for his conduct, that in hating and doing his utmost to
ruin M. Fouquet, he had nothing in view but the welfare of the
state and the dignity of the crown.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> None of these details escaped
Fouquet's observation; through his enemy's thick, bushy brows,
and despite the restless movement of his eyelids, he could, by
merely looking at his eyes, penetrate to the very bottom of
Colbert's heart, and he read to what an unbounded extent hate
towards himself and triumph at his approaching fall existed
there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But as, in
observing everything, he wished to remain himself impenetrable,
he composed his features, smiled with the charmingly sympathetic
smile that was peculiarly his own, and saluted the king with the
most dignified and graceful ease and elasticity of manner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire," he said, "I perceive
by your majesty's joyous air that you have been gratified with
the promenade."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Most gratified, indeed,
monsieur le surintendant, most gratified.<span style=

us, as I invited you to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I was working, sire,"
replied the superintendent, who did not even seem to take the
trouble to turn aside his head in merest respect of Colbert's
presence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> M. Fouquet," cried the king, "there
is nothing like the country.<span style=

country always, in the open air and under the trees."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I should hope that your
majesty is not yet weary of the throne," said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

turf are very pleasant."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

my utmost wishes in speaking in that manner, for I have a request
to submit to you."</p>

monsieur?"</p>

XIV.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty, too, once
deigned to make me a promise," said Fouquet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

celebrated <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i>,

importance by taking part in the conversation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet, with the
profoundest contempt, did not take the slightest notice of the
remark, as if, as far as he was concerned, Colbert had not even
thought or said a word.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty is aware,"
he said, "that I destine my estate at Vaux to receive the most
amiable of princes, the most powerful of monarchs."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have given you my
promise, monsieur," said Louis XIV., smiling; "and a king never
departs from his word."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

sire, to inform your majesty that I am ready to obey your orders
in every respect."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do you promise me many
wonders, monsieur le surintendant?" said Louis, looking at
Colbert.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

majesty a little pleasure, perhaps even a little forgetfulness of
the cares of state."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nay, nay, M. Fouquet,"
returned the king; "I insist upon the word 'wonders.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are a magician, I believe; we
all know the power you wield; we also know that you can find gold
even when there is none to be found elsewhere; so much so,
indeed, that people say you coin it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Fouquet felt that the
shot was discharged from a double quiver, and that the king had
launched an arrow from his own bow as well as one from
Colbert's.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh!" said he,
laughingly, "the people know perfectly well out of what mine I
procure the gold; and they know it only too well, perhaps;
besides," he added, "I can assure your majesty that the gold
destined to pay the expenses of the <i style=

neither blood nor tears; hard labor it may, perhaps, but that can
be paid for."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

confused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He wished to
look at Colbert; Colbert, too, wished to reply to him; a glance
as swift as an eagle's, a king-like glance, indeed, which Fouquet
darted at the latter, arrested the words upon his lips.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, who had by this time
recovered his self-possession, turned towards Fouquet, saying, "I
presume, therefore, I am now to consider myself formally
invited?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire, if your
majesty will condescend so far as to accept my invitation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What day have you
fixed?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Any day your majesty
may find most convenient."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You speak like an
enchanter who has but to conjure up in actuality the wildest
fancies, Monsieur Fouquet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I could not say so much, indeed,
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty will do,
whenever you please, everything that a monarch can and ought to
do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king of France
has servants at his bidding who are able to do anything on his
behalf, to accomplish everything to gratify his pleasures."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert tried to
look at the superintendent, in order to see whether this remark
was an approach to less hostile sentiments on his part; but
Fouquet had not even looked at his enemy, and Colbert hardly
seemed to exist as far as he was concerned.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Very good, then," said the
king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Will a week hence
suit you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Perfectly well,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "This is Tuesday; if I
give you until next Sunday week, will that be sufficient?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The delay which your
majesty deigns to accord me will greatly aid the various works
which my architects have in hand for the purpose of adding to the
amusement of your majesty and your friends."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "By the by, speaking of
my friends," resumed the king; "how do you intend to treat
them?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The king is master
everywhere, sire; your majesty will draw up your own list and
give your own orders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All
those you may deign to invite will be my guests, my honored
guests, indeed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I thank you!" returned
the king, touched by the noble thought expressed in so noble a
tone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet, therefore,
took leave of Louis XIV., after a few words had been added with
regard to the details of certain matters of business.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He felt that Colbert would remain
behind with the king, that they would both converse about him,
and that neither of them would spare him in the least
degree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The satisfaction
of being able to give a last and terrible blow to his enemy
seemed to him almost like a compensation for everything they were
about to subject him to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He turned back again immediately, as soon, indeed, as he had
reached the door, and addressing the king, said, "I was
forgetting that I had to crave your majesty's forgiveness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In what respect?"
said the king, graciously.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"For having
committed a serious fault without perceiving it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A fault!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur Fouquet, I shall be unable
to do otherwise than forgive you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In what way or against whom have you
been found wanting?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Against every
sense of propriety, sire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I forgot to inform your majesty of a circumstance that has lately
occurred of some little importance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert trembled;
he fancied that he was about to frame a denunciation against
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His conduct had been
unmasked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A single
syllable from Fouquet, a single proof formally advanced, and
before the youthful loyalty of feeling which guided Louis XIV.,
Colbert's favor would disappear at once; the latter trembled,
therefore, lest so daring a blow might overthrow his whole
scaffold; in point of fact, the opportunity was so admirably
suited to be taken advantage of, that a skillful, practiced
player like Aramis would not have let it slip.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Sire," said Fouquet, with an easy,
unconcerned air, "since you have had the kindness to forgive me,
I am perfectly indifferent about my confession; this morning I
sold one of the official appointments I hold."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"One of your
appointments," said the king, "which?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert turned
perfectly livid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "That
which conferred upon me, sire, a grand gown, and a stern air of
gravity; the appointment of procureur-g&eacute;n&eacute;ral."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king
involuntarily uttered a loud exclamation and looked at Colbert,
who, with his face bedewed with perspiration, felt almost on the
point of fainting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "To
whom have you sold this department, Monsieur Fouquet?" inquired
the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert was obliged
to lean against a column of the fireplace.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "To a councilor belonging to the
parliament, sire, whose name is Vanel."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Vanel?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire, a
particular friend of the intendant Colbert," added Fouquet;
letting every word fall from his lips with the most inimitable
nonchalance, and with an admirably assumed expression of
forgetfulness and ignorance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And having finished, and having
overwhelmed Colbert beneath the weight of this superiority, the
superintendent again saluted the king and quitted the room,
partially revenged by the stupefaction of the king and the
humiliation of the favorite.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Is it really
possible," said the king, as soon as Fouquet had disappeared,
"that he has sold that office?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire," said
Colbert, meaningly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He must be mad,"
the king added.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert this time
did not reply; he had penetrated the king's thought, a thought
which amply revenged him for the humiliation he had just been
made to suffer; his hatred was augmented by a feeling of bitter
jealousy of Fouquet; and a threat of disgrace was now added to
the plan he had arranged for his ruin.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert felt perfectly assured that
for the future, between Louis XIV. and himself, their hostile
feelings and ideas would meet with no obstacles, and that at the
first fault committed by Fouquet, which could be laid hold of as
a pretext, the chastisement so long impending would be
precipitated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Fouquet had
thrown aside his weapons of defense, and hate and jealousy had
picked them up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Colbert
was invited by the king to the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> at Vaux; he bowed
like a man confident in himself, and accepted the invitation with
the air of one who almost confers a favor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king was about writing down
Saint-Aignan's name on his list of royal commands, when the usher
announced the Comte de Saint-Aignan.<span style=

entered, Colbert discreetly withdrew.</p>

was obliged to talk about her.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, the only person with whom
he could speak about her at his ease was Saint-Aignan, and thus
Saint-Aignan had become an indispensable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, is that you,
comte?" he exclaimed, as soon as he perceived him, doubly
delighted, not only to see him again, but also to get rid of
Colbert, whose scowling face always put him out of humor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "So much the better, I am very
glad to see you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will

some one must have sold the secret of the trap-door."</p>

it."</p>

distinction?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

certain persons, sire, who, being above the price of treason,
give, and do not sell."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, sire!<span style=

clear-sighted not to guess what I mean, and you will save me the
embarrassment of naming the person I allude to."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are right: you mean
Madame; I suppose her suspicions were aroused by your changing
your lodgings."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Madame has keys of the
apartments of her maids of honor, and she is powerful enough to
discover what no one but yourself could do, or she would not be
able to discover anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you suppose, then,
that my sister must have entered into an alliance with
Bragelonne, and has informed him of all the details of the
affair."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Possibly even better
still, for she perhaps accompanied him there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

own apartments?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

impossible, sire?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well,
listen to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your
majesty knows that Madame is very fond of perfumes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, she acquired that
taste from my mother."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

particularly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Yes, it is the
scent she prefers to all others."<br>
"Very good, sire! my apartments happen to smell very strongly of
vervain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king remained
silent and thoughtful for a few moments, and then resumed: "But
why should Madame take Bragelonne's part against me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan could
very easily have replied: "A woman's jealousy!"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king probed his friend to the
bottom of his heart to ascertain if he had learned the secret of
his flirtation with his sister-in-law.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Saint-Aignan was not an ordinary
courtier; he did not lightly run the risk of finding out family
secrets; and he was too a friend of the Muses not to think very
frequently of poor Ovidius Naso, whose eyes shed so many tears in
expiation of his crime for having once beheld something, one
hardly knows what, in the palace of Augustus.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He therefore passed by Madame's
secret very skillfully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
But as he had shown no ordinary sagacity in indicating Madame's
presence in his rooms in company with Bragelonne, it was
necessary, of course, for him to repay with interest the king's
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>amour propre</i>, and reply
plainly to the question which had been put to him of: "Why has
Madame taken Bragelonne's part against me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why?" replied
Saint-Aignan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Your
majesty forgets, I presume, that the Comte de Guiche is the
intimate friend of the Vicomte de Bragelonne."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I do not see the
connection, however," said the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I beg your pardon, then, sire; but I
thought the Comte de Guiche was a very great friend of
Madame's."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quite true," the
king returned; "there is no occasion to search any further, the
blow came from that direction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And is not your
majesty of opinion that, in order to ward it off, it will be
necessary to deal another blow?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, but not one
of the kind given in the Bois de Vincennes," replied the
king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You forget, sire,"
said Saint-Aignan, "that I am a gentleman, and that I have been
challenged."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The challenge
neither concerns nor was it intended for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But I am the man,
sire, who has been expected at the Minimes, sire, during the last
hour and more; and I shall be dishonored if I do not go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The first honor
and duty of a gentleman is obedience to his sovereign."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I order you to
remain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Obey,
monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As your majesty
pleases."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Besides, I wish to
have the whole of this affair explained; I wish to know how it is
that I have been so insolently trifled with, as to have the
sanctuary of my affections pried into.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is not you, Saint-Aignan, whose
business it is to punish those who have acted in this manner, for
it is not your honor they have attacked, but my own."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I implore your
majesty not to overwhelm M. de Bragelonne with your wrath, for
although in the whole of this affair he may have shown himself
deficient in prudence, he has not been so in his feelings of
loyalty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Enough!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I shall know how to decide
between the just and the unjust, even in the height of my
anger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But take care that
not a word of this is breathed to Madame."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But what am I to
do with regard to M. de Bragelonne?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He will be seeking me in every
direction, and - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I shall either
have spoken to him, or taken care that he has been spoken to,
before the evening is over."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let me once more
entreat your majesty to be indulgent towards him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have been
indulgent long enough, comte," said Louis XIV., frowning
severely; "it is now quite time to show certain persons that I am
master in my own palace."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king had hardly
pronounced these words, which betokened that a fresh feeling of
irritation was mingling with the recollections of old, when an
usher appeared at the door of the cabinet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What is the matter?" inquired the
king, "and why do you presume to come when I have not summoned
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire," said the
usher, "your majesty desired me to permit M. le Comte de la
F&egrave;re to pass freely on any and every occasion, when he
might wish to speak to your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"M. le Comte de la
F&egrave;re is now waiting to see your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king and
Saint-Aignan at this reply exchanged a look which betrayed more
uneasiness than surprise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Louis hesitated for a moment, but immediately afterwards, seeming
to make up his mind, he said:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Go, Saint-Aignan,
and find Louise; inform her of the plot against us; do not let
her be ignorant that Madame will return to her system of
persecutions against her, and that she has set those to work who
would have found it far safer to remain neuter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If Louise gets
nervous and frightened, reassure her as much as you can; tell her
that the king's affection is an impenetrable shield over her; if,
which I suspect is the case, she already knows everything, or if
she has already been herself subjected to an attack of some kind
or other from any quarter, tell her, be sure to tell her,
Saint-Aignan," added the king, trembling with passion, "tell her,
I say, that this time, instead of defending her, I will avenge
her, and that too so terribly that no one will in future even
dare to raise his eyes towards her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Is that all,
sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, all.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Go as quickly as you can, and
remain faithful; for, you who live in the midst of this stake of
infernal torments, have not, like myself, the hope of the
paradise beyond it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Saint-Aignan
exhausted himself in protestations of<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> devotion, took the king's hand,
kissed it, and left the room radiant with delight.</p>

T</span>he king endeavored to recover his self-possession as
quickly as possible, in order to meet M. de la F&egrave;re with
an untroubled countenance.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He clearly saw it was not mere
chance that had induced the comte's visit, he had some vague
impression of its importance; but he felt that to a man of
Athos's tone of mind, to one of such a high order of intellect,
his first reception ought not to present anything either
disagreeable or otherwise than kind and courteous.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as the king had satisfied
himself that, as far as appearances went, he was perfectly calm
again, he gave directions to the ushers to introduce the
comte.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A few minutes
afterwards Athos, in full court dress, and with his breast
covered with the orders that he alone had the right to wear at
the court of France, presented himself with so grave and solemn
an air that the king perceived, at the first glance, that he was
not deceived in his anticipations.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis advanced a step towards the
comte, and, with a smile, held out his hand to him, over which
Athos bowed with the air of the deepest respect.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Monsieur le Comte de la
F&egrave;re," said the king rapidly, "you are so seldom here,
that it is a real piece of good fortune to see you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos bowed and replied,
"I should wish always to enjoy the happiness of being near your
majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The tone, however, in
which this reply was conveyed, evidently signified, "I should
wish to be one of your majesty's advisers, to save you the
commission of faults."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The king felt it so, and determined in this man's presence to
preserve all the advantages which could be derived from his
command over himself, as well as from his rank and position.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I see you have
something to say to me," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

should not have presumed to present myself before your
majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Speak quickly, I am
anxious to satisfy you," returned the king, seating himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am persuaded,"
replied Athos, in a somewhat agitated tone of voice, "that your
majesty will give me every satisfaction."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" said the king,
with a certain haughtiness of manner, "you have come to lodge a
complaint here, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It would be a
complaint," returned Athos, "only in the event of your majesty -
but if you will deign to permit me, sire, I will begin the
conversation from the very commencement."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Do so, I am
listening."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Your majesty will
remember that at the period of the Duke of Buckingham's
departure, I had the honor of an interview with you."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At or about
that period, I think I remember you did; only, with regard to the
subject of the conversation, I have quite forgotten it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos started, as he
replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I shall have
the honor to remind your majesty of it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was with regard to a formal
demand I had addressed to you respecting a marriage which M. de
Bragelonne wished to contract with Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah!" thought the king,
"we have come to it now. - I remember," he said, aloud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "At that period,"
pursued Athos, "your majesty was so kind and generous towards M.
de Bragelonne and myself, that not a single word which then fell
from your lips has escaped my memory; and, when I asked your
majesty to accord me Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re's hand
for M. de Bragelonne, you refused."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Quite true," said
Louis, dryly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Alleging," Athos
hastened to say, "that the young lady had no position in
society."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Louis could hardly force
himself to listen with an appearance of royal propriety.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That," added Athos,
"she had but little fortune."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king threw himself
back in his armchair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That her
extraction was indifferent."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>A renewed
impatience on the part of the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And little
beauty," added Athos, pitilessly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>This last bolt
buried itself deep in the king's heart, and made him almost bound
from his seat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You have a good
memory, monsieur," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I invariably have,
on occasions when I have had the distinguished honor of an
interview with your majesty," retorted the comte, without being
in the least disconcerted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good: it is
admitted that I said all that."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And I thanked your
majesty for your remarks at the time, because they testified an
interest in M. de Bragelonne which did him much honor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And you may
possibly remember," said the king, very deliberately, "that you
had the greatest repugnance for this marriage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quite true,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And that you
solicited my permission, much against your own inclination?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And finally, I
remember, for I have a memory nearly as good as your own; I
remember, I say, that you observed at the time: 'I do not believe
that Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re loves M. de
Bragelonne.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Is that
true?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The blow told well,
but Athos did not draw back.<span style=

begged your majesty's forgiveness; but there are certain
particulars in that conversation which are only intelligible from
the <i style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, what is the
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>d&eacute;nouement</i>,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"This: that your
majesty then said, 'that you would defer the marriage out of
regard for M. de Bragelonne's own interests.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king remained
silent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "M. de Bragelonne
is now so exceedingly unhappy that he cannot any longer defer
asking your majesty for a solution of the matter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king turned
pale; Athos looked at him with fixed attention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And what," said
the king, with considerable hesitation, "does M. de Bragelonne
request?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Precisely the very
thing that I came to ask your majesty for at my last audience,
namely, your majesty's consent to his marriage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king remained
perfectly silent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The
questions which referred to the different obstacles in the way
are all now quite removed for us," continued Athos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re,
without fortune, birth, or beauty, is not the less on that
account the only good match in the world for M. de Bragelonne,
since he loves this young girl."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king pressed
his hands impatiently together.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Does your majesty hesitate?"
inquired the comte, without losing a particle of either his
firmness of his politeness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I do not hesitate
- I refuse," replied the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos paused a
moment, as if to collect himself: "I have had the honor," he
said, in a mild tone, "to observe to your majesty that no
obstacle now interferes with M. de Bragelonne's affections, and
that his determination seems unalterable."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There is my will -
and that is an obstacle, I should imagine!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is the most
serious of all," Athos replied quickly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And may we,
therefore, be permitted to ask your majesty, with the greatest
humility, your reason for this refusal?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The reason! - A
question to me!" exclaimed the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A demand,
sire!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king, leaning
with both his hands upon the table, said, in a deep tone of
concentrated passion: "You have lost all recollection of what is
usual at court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At court,
please to remember, no one ventures to put a question to the
king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very true, sire;
but if men do not question, they conjecture."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Conjecture!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What may that mean,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very frequently,
sire, conjecture with regard to a particular subject implies a
want of frankness on the part of the king - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And a want of
confidence on the part of the subject," pursued Athos,
intrepidly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You forget
yourself," said the king, hurried away by anger in spite of all
his self-control.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire, I am obliged
to seek elsewhere for what I thought I should find in your
majesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Instead of
obtaining a reply from you, I am compelled to make one for
myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king rose.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Monsieur le comte," he said,
"I have now given you all the time I had at my disposal."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was a dismissal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire," replied the
comte, "I have not yet had time to tell your majesty what I came
with the express object of saying, and I so rarely see your
majesty that I ought to avail myself of the opportunity."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Just now you spoke
rudely of conjectures; you are now becoming offensive,
monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, sire! offend
your majesty!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I? -
never!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All my life
through I have maintained that kings are above all other men, not
only from their rank and power, but from their nobleness of heart
and their true dignity of mind.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I never can bring myself to believe
that my sovereign, he who passed his word to me, did so with a
mental reservation."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you mean?
what mental reservation do you allude to?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will explain my
meaning," said Athos, coldly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "If, in refusing Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re to Monsieur de Bragelonne, your majesty had some
other object in view than the happiness and fortune of the
vicomte - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You perceive,
monsieur, that you are offending me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If, in requiring
the vicomte to delay his marriage, your majesty's only object was
to remove the gentleman to whom Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re was engaged - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur!
monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have heard it
said so in every direction, sire.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty's affection for
Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re is spoken of on all
sides."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king tore his
gloves, which he had been biting for some time.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Woe to those," he cried, "who
interfere in my affairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I have made up my mind to take a particular course, and I will
break through every obstacle in my way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What obstacle?"
said Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king stopped
short, like a horse which, having taken the bit between his teeth
and run away, finds it has slipped it back again, and that his
career is checked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I
love Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re," he said suddenly, with
mingled nobleness of feeling and passion.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But," interrupted
Athos, "that does not preclude your majesty from allowing M. de
Bragelonne to marry Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The sacrifice is worthy of so
great a monarch; it is fully merited by M. de Bragelonne, who has
already rendered great service to your majesty, and who may well
be regarded as a brave and worthy man.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty, therefore, in
renouncing the affection you entertain, offers a proof at once of
generosity, gratitude, and good policy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re does not love M. de Bragelonne," said the king,
hoarsely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Does your majesty
know that to be the case?" remarked Athos, with a searching
look.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I do know it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Since a very short
time, then; for doubtless, had your majesty known it when I first
preferred my request, you would have taken the trouble to inform
me of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Since a very short
time, it is true, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos remained
silent for a moment, and then resumed: "In that case, I do not
understand why your majesty should have sent M. de Bragelonne to
London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That exile, and
most properly so, too, is a matter of astonishment to every one
who regards your majesty's honor with sincere affection."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Who presumes to
impugn my honor, Monsieur de la F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The king's honor,
sire, is made up of the honor of his whole nobility.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whenever the king offends one of his
gentlemen, that is, whenever he deprives him of the smallest
particle of his honor, it is from him, from the king himself,
that that portion of honor is stolen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur de la
F&egrave;re!" said the king, haughtily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire, you sent M.
de Bragelonne to London either before you were Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re's lover, or since you have become so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king, irritated
beyond measure, especially because he felt that he was being
mastered, endeavored to dismiss Athos by a gesture.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire," replied the
comte, "I will tell you all; I will not leave your presence until
I have been satisfied by your majesty or by myself; satisfied if
you prove to me that you are right, - satisfied if I prove to you
that you are wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nay,
sire, you can but listen to me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am old now, and I am attached to
everything that is really great and really powerful in your
kingdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am of those
who have shed their blood for your father and for yourself,
without ever having asked a single favor either from yourself or
from your father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have
never inflicted the slightest wrong or injury on any one in this
world, and even kings are still my debtors.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You can but listen to me, I
repeat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have come to
ask you for an account of the honor of one of your servants whom
you have deceived by a falsehood, or betrayed by want of heart of
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know that
these words irritate your majesty, but the facts themselves are
killing us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know that
you are endeavoring to find some means whereby to chastise me for
my frankness; but I know also the chastisement I will implore God
to inflict upon you when I relate to Him your perjury and my
son's unhappiness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king during
these remarks was walking hurriedly to and fro, his hand thrust
into the breast of his coat, his head haughtily raised, his eyes
blazing with wrath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Monsieur," he cried, suddenly, "if I acted towards you as a
king, you would be already punished; but I am only a man, and I
have the right to love in this world every one who loves me, - a
happiness which is so rarely found."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You cannot pretend
to such a right as a man any more than as a king, sire; or if you
intend to exercise that right in a loyal manner, you should have
told M. de Bragelonne so, and not have exiled him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is too great a
condescension, monsieur, to discuss these things with you,"
interrupted Louis XIV., with that majesty of air and manner he
alone seemed able to give his look and his voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I was hoping that
you would reply to me," said the comte.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You shall know my
reply, monsieur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You already know
my thoughts on the subject," was the Comte de la F&egrave;re's
answer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You have forgotten
you are speaking to the king, monsieur.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is a crime."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You have forgotten
you are destroying the lives of two men, sire.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is a mortal sin."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Leave the
room!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not until I have
said this: 'Son of Louis XIII., you begin your reign badly, for
you begin it by abduction and disloyalty!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My race - myself too - are now freed
from all that affection and respect towards you, which I made my
son swear to observe in the vaults of Saint-Denis, in the
presence of the relics of your noble forefathers.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are now become our enemy, sire,
and henceforth we have nothing to do save with Heaven alone, our
sole master.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Be warned,
be warned, sire.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What! do you
threaten?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, no," said
Athos, sadly, "I have as little bravado as fear in my soul.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The God of whom I spoke to you
is now listening to me; He knows that for the safety and honor of
your crown I would even yet shed every drop of blood twenty years
of civil and foreign warfare have left in my veins.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I can well say, then, that I
threaten the king as little as I threaten the man; but I tell
you, sire, you lose two servants; for you have destroyed faith in
the heart of the father, and love in the heart of the son; the
one ceases to believe in the royal word, the other no longer
believes in the loyalty of the man, or the purity of woman: the
one is dead to every feeling of respect, the other to
obedience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Adieu!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Thus saying, Athos
broke his sword across his knee, slowly placed the two pieces
upon the floor, and saluting the king, who was almost choking
from rage and shame, he quitted the cabinet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis, who sat near the table,
completely overwhelmed, was several minutes before he could
collect himself; but he suddenly rose and rang the bell
violently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Tell M.
d'Artagnan to come here," he said to the terrified ushers.</p>

O</span>ur readers will doubtlessly have been asking themselves
how it happened that Athos, of whom not a word has been said for
some time past, arrived so very opportunely at court.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We will, without delay, endeavor to
satisfy their curiosity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Porthos, faithful to his
duty as an arranger of affairs, had, immediately after leaving
the Palais Royal, set off to join Raoul at the Minimes in the
Bois de Vincennes, and had related everything, even to the
smallest details, which had passed between Saint-Aignan and
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He finished by
saying that the message which the king had sent to his favorite
would probably not occasion more than a short delay, and that
Saint-Aignan, as soon as he could leave the king, would not lose
a moment in accepting the invitation Raoul had sent him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> But Raoul, less
credulous than his old friend, had concluded from Porthos's
recital that if Saint-Aignan was going to the king, Saint-Aignan
would tell the king everything, and that the king would most
assuredly forbid Saint-Aignan to obey the summons he had received
to the hostile meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The consequence of his reflections was, that he had left Porthos
to remain at the place appointed for the meeting, in the very
improbable case that Saint-Aignan would come there; having
endeavored to make Porthos promise that he would not remain there
more than an hour or an hour and a half at the very longest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos, however, formally
refused to do anything of the kind, but, on the contrary,
installed himself in the Minimes as if he were going to take root
there, making Raoul promise that when he had been to see his
father, he would return to his own apartments, in order that
Porthos's servant might know where to find him in case M. de
Saint-Aignan should happen to come to the rendezvous.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Bragelonne had left
Vincennes, and proceeded at once straight to the apartments of
Athos, who had been in Paris during the last two days, the comte
having been already informed of what had taken place, by a letter
from D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul
arrived at his father's; Athos, after having held out his hand to
him, and embraced him most affectionately, made a sign for him to
sit down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I know you come to me
as a man would go to a friend, vicomte, whenever he is suffering;
tell me, therefore, what is it that brings you now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The young man bowed, and
began his recital; more than once in the course of it his tears
almost choked his utterance, and a sob, checked in his throat,
compelled him to suspend his narrative for a few minutes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos most probably already
knew how matters stood, as we have just now said D'Artagnan had
already written to him; but, preserving until the conclusion that
calm, unruffled composure of manner which constituted the almost
superhuman side of his character, he replied, "Raoul, I do not
believe there is a word of truth in these rumors; I do not
believe in the existence of what you fear, although I do not deny
that persons best entitled to the fullest credit have already
conversed with me on the subject.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In my heart and soul I think it
utterly impossible that the king could be guilty of such an
outrage on a gentleman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I
will answer for the king, therefore, and will soon bring you back
the proof of what I say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul, wavering like a
drunken man between what he had seen with his own eyes and the
imperturbable faith he had in a man who had never told a
falsehood, bowed and simply answered, "Go, then, monsieur le
comte; I will await your return."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he sat down, burying his face in
his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos dressed,
and then left him, in order to wait upon the king; the result of
that interview is already known to our readers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> When he returned to his
lodgings, Raoul, pale and dejected, had not quitted his attitude
of despair. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the
sound, however, of the opening doors, and of his father's
footsteps as he approached him, the young man raised his
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos's face was
very pale, his head uncovered, and his manner full of
seriousness; he gave his cloak and hat to the lackey, dismissed
him with a gesture, and sat down near Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well, monsieur,"
inquired the young man, "are you convinced yet?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I am, Raoul; the king
loves Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He confesses it, then?"
cried Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," replied
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And she?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have not
seen her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No; but the king spoke
to you about her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What
did he say?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "He says
that she loves him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, you see - you see,
monsieur!" said the young man, with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Raoul," resumed the
comte, "I told the king, believe me, all that you yourself could
possibly have urged, and I believe I did so in becoming language,
though sufficiently firm."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And what did you say to
him, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I told him, Raoul, that
everything was now at an end between him and ourselves; that you
would never serve him again.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I told him that I, too, should
remain aloof.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing
further remains for me, then, but to be satisfied of one
thing."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "What is that,
monsieur?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Whether you
have determined to adopt any steps."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Any
steps?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Regarding
what?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "With reference to your
disappointed affection, and - your ideas of vengeance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, monsieur, with
regard to my affection, I shall, perhaps, some day or other,
succeed in tearing it from my heart; I trust I shall do so, aided
by Heaven's merciful help, and your own wise exhortations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As far as vengeance is
concerned, it occurred to me only when under the influence of an
evil thought, for I could not revenge myself upon the one who is
actually guilty; I have, therefore, already renounced every idea
of revenge."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you no longer think
of seeking a quarrel with M. de Saint-Aignan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "No, monsieur; I sent
him a challenge: if M. de Saint-Aignan accepts it, I will
maintain it; if he does not take it up, I will leave things as
they are."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And La
Valli&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You cannot, I know,
have seriously thought that I should dream of revenging myself
upon a woman!" replied Raoul, with a smile so sad that a tear
started even to the eyes of his father, who had so many times in
the course of his life bowed beneath his own sorrows and those of
others.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He held out his hand to
Raoul, which the latter seized most eagerly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And so, monsieur le
comte, you are quite satisfied that the misfortune is one beyond
all remedy?" inquired the young man.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Poor boy!" he
murmured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You think that I still
live in hope," said Raoul, "and you pity me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, it is indeed horrible suffering
for me to despise, as I am bound to do, the one I have loved so
devotedly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I had but
some real cause of complaint against her, I should be happy, I
should be able to forgive her."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos looked at his son
with a profoundly sorrowful air, for the words Raoul had just
pronounced seemed to have issued out of his own heart.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this moment the servant
announced M. d'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
This name sounded very differently to the ears of Athos and
Raoul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The musketeer
entered the room with a vague smile on his lips.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul paused.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos walked towards his friend with
an expression of face that did not escape Bragelonne.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan answered Athos's look by
an imperceptible movement of the eyelid; and then, advancing
towards Raoul, whom he took by the hand, he said, addressing both
father and son, "Well, you are trying to console this poor boy,
it seems."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And you, kind and good
as usual, have come to help me in my difficult task."<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> As he said
this, Athos pressed D'Artagnan's hand between both his own.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul fancied he observed in
this pressure something beyond the sense his mere words
conveyed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes," replied the
musketeer, smoothing his mustache with the hand that Athos had
left free, "yes, I have come too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are most welcome,
chevalier; not for the consolation you bring with you, but on
your own account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am
already consoled," said Raoul; and he attempted to smile, but the
effort was more sad than any tears D'Artagnan had ever seen
shed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That is all well and
good, then," said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Only," continued Raoul,
"you have arrived just as the comte was about to give me the
details of his interview with the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will allow the comte to
continue?" added the young man, as, with his eyes fixed on the
musketeer, he seemed to read the very depths of his heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "His interview with the
king?" said D'Artagnan, in a tone so natural and unassumed that
there was no means of suspecting that his astonishment was
feigned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You have seen
the king, then, Athos?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Athos smiled
as he said, "Yes, I have seen him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah, indeed; you were
unaware, then, that the comte had seen his majesty?" inquired
Raoul, half reassured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In that case, I am less
uneasy," said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

what?" inquired Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

said Raoul, "but knowing so well the regard and affection you
have for me, I was afraid you might possibly have expressed
somewhat plainly to his majesty my own sufferings and your

'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "And that the king had
consequently?" repeated D'Artagnan; "well, go on, finish what you
were going to say."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I have now to ask you
to forgive me, Monsieur d'Artagnan," said Raoul.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "For a moment, and I cannot help
confessing it, I trembled lest you had come here, not as M.
d'Artagnan, but as captain of the musketeers."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "You are mad, my poor
boy," cried D'Artagnan, with a burst of laughter, in which an
exact observer might perhaps have wished to have heard a little
more frankness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "So much the better,"
said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, mad; and do you
know what I would advise you to do?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Tell me, monsieur, for
the advice is sure to be good, as it comes from you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Very good, then; I
advise you, after your long journey from England, after your
visit to M. de Guiche, after your visit to Madame, after your
visit to Porthos, after your journey to Vincennes, I advise you,
I say, to take a few hours' rest; go and lie down, sleep for a
dozen hours, and when you wake up, go and ride one of my horses
until you have tired him to death."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And drawing Raoul
towards him, he embraced him as he would have done his own
child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos did the
like; only it was very visible that the kiss was still more
affectionate, and the pressure of his lips even warmer with the
father than with the friend.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young man again looked at both
his companions, endeavoring to penetrate their real meaning or
their real feelings with the utmost strength of his intelligence;
but his look was powerless upon the smiling countenance of the
musketeer or upon the calm and composed features of the Comte de
la F&egrave;re.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Where
are you going, Raoul?" inquired the latter, seeing that
Bragelonne was preparing to go out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "To my own apartments,"
replied the latter, in his soft, sad voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "We shall be sure to
find you there, then, if we should have anything to say to
you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, monsieur; but do
you suppose it likely you will have something to say to me?"<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "How can I
tell?" said Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, something fresh to
console you with," said D'Artagnan, pushing him towards the
door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul, observing the
perfect composure which marked every gesture of his two friends,
quitted the comte's room, carrying away with him nothing but the
individual feeling of his own particular distress.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Thank Heaven," he said,
"since that is the case, I need only think of myself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And wrapping himself up
in his cloak, in order to conceal from the passers-by in the
streets his gloomy and sorrowful face, he quitted them, for the
purpose of returning to his own rooms, as he had promised
Porthos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two friends
watched the young man as he walked away with a feeling of genuine
disinterested pity; only each expressed it in a different
way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Poor Raoul!" said
Athos, sighing deeply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

D'Artagnan, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

"P</span>oor Raoul!" had said Athos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Poor Raoul!" had said D'Artagnan:
and, in point of fact, to be pitied by both these men, Raoul must
indeed have been most unhappy.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And therefore, when he found himself
alone, face to face, as it were, with his own troubles, leaving
behind him the intrepid friend and the indulgent father; when he
recalled the avowal of the king's affection, which had robbed him
of Louise de la Valli&egrave;re, whom he loved so deeply, he felt
his heart almost breaking, as indeed we all have at least once in
our lives, at the first illusion destroyed, the first affection
betrayed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh!" he
murmured, "all is over, then.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing is now left me in this
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing to look
forward to, nothing to hope for.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Guiche has told me so, my father has
told me so, M. d'Artagnan has told me so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All life is but an idle dream.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The future which I have been
hopelessly pursuing for the last ten years is a dream! the union
of hearts, a dream! a life of love and happiness, a dream!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Poor fool that I am," he
continued, after a pause, "to dream away my existence aloud,
publicly, and in the face of others, friends and enemies - and
for what purpose, too? in order that my friends may be saddened
by my troubles, and my enemies may laugh at my sorrows.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so my unhappiness will
soon become a notorious disgrace, a public scandal; and who knows
but that to-morrow I may even be a public laughing-stock?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> And, despite the
composure which he had promised his father and D'Artagnan to
observe, Raoul could not resist uttering a few words of darkest
menace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And yet," he
continued, "if my name were De Wardes, and if I had the pliancy
of character and strength of will of M. d'Artagnan, I should
laugh, with my lips at least; I should convince other women that
this perfidious girl, honored by the affection I have wasted on
her, leaves me only one regret, that of having been abused and
deceived by her seemingly modest and irreproachable conduct; a
few might perhaps fawn on the king by jesting at my expense; I
should put myself on the track of some of those buffoons; I
should chastise a few of them, perhaps; the men would fear me,
and by the time I had laid three dying or dead at my feet, I
should be adored by the women.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Yes, yes, that, indeed, would be the
proper course to adopt, and the Comte de la F&egrave;re himself
would not object to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Has not he also been tried, in his earlier days, in the same
manner as I have just been tried myself?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Did he not replace affection by
intoxication?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He has
often told me so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why
should I not replace love by pleasure?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He must have suffered as much as I
suffer, even more - if that is possible.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The history of one man is the
history of all, a dragging trial, more or less prolonged, more or
less bitter - sorrowful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The note of human nature is nothing but one sustained cry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But what are the sufferings of
others compared to those from which I am now suffering?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Does the open wound in
another's breast soften the anguish of the gaping ulcer in our
own?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Does the blood which
is welling from another man's side stanch that which is pouring
from our own?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Does the
general grief of our fellow-creatures lessen our own private and
particular woe?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, no,
each suffers on his own account, each struggles with his own
grief, each sheds his own tears.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And besides," he went on, "what has
my life been up to the present moment?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A cold, barren, sterile arena, in
which I have always fought for others, never for myself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sometimes for a king,
sometimes for a woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The king has betrayed, the woman disdained me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Miserable, unlucky wretch that I
am!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Women!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Can I not make all expiate the crime
of one of their sex?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What
does that need?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To have a
heart no longer, or to forget that I ever had one; to be strong,
even against weakness itself; to lean always, even when one feels
that the support is giving way.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is needed to attain, or succeed
in all that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To be young,
handsome, strong, valiant, rich.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am, or shall be, all that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But honor?" he still
continued, "and what is honor after all?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A theory which every man understands
in his own way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My father
tells me: 'Honor is the consideration of what is due to others,
and particularly what is due to oneself.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Guiche, and Manicamp, and
Saint-Aignan particularly, would say to me: 'What's honor?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Honor consists in studying and
yielding to the passions and pleasures of one's king.'<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Honor such as that indeed, is
easy and productive enough.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With honor like that, I can keep my
post at the court, become a gentleman of the chamber, and accept
the command of a regiment, which may at any time be presented to
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> With honor such as
that, I can be duke and peer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The stain which that
woman has stamped upon me, the grief that has broken my heart,
the heart of the friend and playmate of her childhood, in no way
affects M. de Bragelonne, an excellent officer, a courageous
leader, who will cover himself with glory at the first encounter,
and who will become a hundred times greater than Mademoiselle de
la Valli&egrave;re is to-day, the mistress of the king - for the
king will not marry her - and the more publicly he will proclaim
her as his mistress, the more opaque will grow the shadow of
shame he casts upon her face, in the guise of a crown; and in
proportion as others despise, as I despise her, I shall be
gleaning honors in the field.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Alas! we had walked together side by
side, she and I, during the earliest, the brightest, the most
angelic portion of our existence, hand in hand along the charming
path of life, covered with the blossoms of youth; and then, alas!
we reach a cross-road, where she separates herself from me, in
which we have to follow a different route, whereby we become more
and more widely separated from each other.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And to attain the end of this path,
oh, Heaven!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am now
alone, in utter despair, and crushed to the very earth."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Such were the sinister
reflections in which Raoul indulged, when his foot mechanically
paused at the door of his own dwelling.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had reached it without remarking
the streets through which he passed, without knowing how he had
come; he pushed open the door, continued to advance, and ascended
the staircase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
staircase, as in most of the houses at that period, was very
dark, and the landings most obscure.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul lived on the first floor; he
paused in order to ring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Olivain appeared, took his sword and cloak from his hands; Raoul
himself opened the door which, from the ante-chamber, led into a
small <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salon</i>, richly
furnished enough for the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salon</i> of a young man, and
completely filled with flowers by Olivain, who, knowing his
master's tastes, had shown himself studiously attentive in
gratifying them, without caring whether his master perceived his
attention or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There
was a portrait of La Valli&egrave;re in the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>salon</i>, which had been drawn by
herself and given by her to Raoul.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This portrait, fastened above a
large easy chair covered with dark colored damask, was the first
point towards which Raoul bent his steps - the first object on
which he fixed his eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
It was, moreover, Raoul's usual habit to do so; every time he
entered his room, this portrait, before anything else, attracted
his attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This time,
as usual, he walked straight up to the portrait, placed his knees
upon the arm chair, and paused to look at it sadly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His arms were crossed upon his
breast, his head slightly thrown back, his eyes filled with
tears, his mouth worked into a bitter smile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He looked at the portrait of the one
he had so tenderly loved; and then all that he had said passed
before his mind again, all that he had suffered seemed again to
assail his heart; and, after a long silence, he murmured for the
third time, "Miserable, unhappy wretch that I am!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> He had hardly pronounced
these words, when he heard the sound of a sigh and a groan behind
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He turned sharply
round and perceived, in the angle of the <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>salon</i>, standing up, a bending
veiled female figure, which he had been the means of concealing
behind the door as he opened it, and which he had not perceived
as he entered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
advanced towards the figure, whose presence in his room had not
been announced to him; and as he bowed, and inquired at the same
moment who she was, she suddenly raised her head, and removed the
veil from her face, revealing her pale and sorrow-stricken
features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul staggered
back as if he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Louise!" he cried, in a
tone of such absolute despair, one could hardly have thought the
human voice was capable of so desponding a cry, without the
snapping of the human heart.</p>

"You here!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

the sound of their throbbing hearts might have been heard, not in
unison with each other, but the one beating as violently as the
other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was for Louise
to speak, and she made an effort to do so.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

Raoul stammered out, almost breathless from emotion, "as far as I

interrupting him with her soft, sweet voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

fell down on a chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Speak," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> She cast a glance all
round her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This look was
a timid entreaty, and implored secrecy far more effectually than
her expressed words had done a few minutes before.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul rouse, and went to the door,
which he opened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Olivain," he said, "I am not within for any one."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then, turning towards Louise, he
added, "Is not that what you wished?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Nothing could have
produced a greater effect upon Louise than these few words, which
seemed to signify, "You see that I still understand you."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She passed a handkerchief
across her eyes, in order to remove a rebellious tear which she
could not restrain; and then, having collected herself for a
moment, she said, "Raoul, do not turn your kind, frank look away
from me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are not one
of those men who despise a woman for having given her heart to
another, even though her affection might render him unhappy, or
might wound his pride."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Raoul did not reply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul
continued to preserve the same unbroken silence.<span style=

with an air that seemed to say, "Encourage me; for pity's sake,
but a single word!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But
Raoul did not open his lips; and the young girl was obliged to
continue:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Just now," she said,
"M. de Saint-Aignan came to me by the king's directions."<span

said this; while Raoul, on his side, turned his away, in order to
avoid looking at her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "M.
de Saint-Aignan came to me from the king," she repeated, "and
told me that you knew all;" and she attempted to look Raoul in
the face, after inflicting this further wound upon him, in
addition to the many others he had already received; but it was
impossible to meet Raoul's eyes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

incensed with me - and justly so, I admit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

at the young girl, and a smile full of disdain passed across his
lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

entreat you, do not say that you have had any other feeling
against me than that of anger merely.<span style=

all - wait until I have said to you all that I had to say - all

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Raoul, by the strength
of his iron will, forced his features to assume a calmer
expression, and the disdainful smile upon his lip passed
away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "In the first place,"
said La Valli&egrave;re, "in the first place, with my hands

ground before you, I entreat you, as the most generous, as the
noblest of men, to pardon, to forgive me.<span style=

- on that day, when I read in the depths of my own heart, when I
confessed to myself that you no longer filled my mind entirely,
when I saw another future before me than that of being your
friend, your life-long companion, your wife - on that day, Raoul,
you were not, alas! any more beside me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

knew you so thoroughly - I knew how devotedly you loved me, that
I trembled at the bare idea of the grief I was about to cause
you; and that is so true, Raoul, that this very moment I am now
speaking to you, bending thus before you, my heart crushed in my
bosom, my voice full of sighs, my eyes full of tears, it is so
perfectly true, that I have no other defense than my frankness, I
have no other sorrow greater than that which I read in your

A</span>s soon as Raoul had quitted Athos and D'Artagnan, as the
two exclamations that had followed his departure escaped their
lips, they found themselves face to face alone.<span style=

earnest air that he had assumed at D'Artagnan's arrival.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," he said, "what
have you come to announce to me, my friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I?" inquired
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; I do not see
you in this way without some reason for it," said Athos,
smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The deuce!" said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will place you
at your ease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king is
furious, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, I must say
he is not altogether pleased."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And you have come
to arrest me, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My dear friend,
you have hit the very mark."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, I expected
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am quite ready to
go with you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Deuce take it!"
said D'Artagnan, "what a hurry you are in."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am afraid of
delaying you," said Athos, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have plenty of
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you not
curious, besides, to know how things went on between the king and
me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If you will be
good enough to tell me, I will listen with the greatest of
pleasure," said Athos, pointing out to D'Artagnan a large chair,
into which the latter threw himself, assuming the easiest
possible attitude.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, I will do so
willingly enough," continued D'Artagnan, "for the conversation is
rather curious, I must say.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the first place the king sent for
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As soon as I had
left?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You were just
going down the last steps of the staircase, as the musketeers
told me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I arrived.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My dear Athos, he was not red
in the face merely, he was positively purple.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I was not aware, of course, of what
had passed; only, on the ground, lying on the floor, I saw a
sword broken in two."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Captain
d'Artagnan,' cried the king, as soon as he saw me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Sire,' I
replied.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'M. de la
F&egrave;re has just left me; he is an insolent man.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'An insolent man!'
I exclaimed, in such a tone that the king stopped suddenly
short.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Captain
d'Artagnan,' resumed the king, with his teeth clenched, 'you will
be good enough to listen to and hear me.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'That is my duty,
sire.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'I have, out of
consideration for M. de la F&egrave;re, wished to spare him - he
is a man of whom I still retain some kind recollections - the
discredit of being arrested in my palace.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You will therefore take a
carriage.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At this I made
a slight movement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'If you object to
arrest him yourself,' continued the king, 'send me my captain of
the guards.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Sire,' I replied,
'there is no necessity for the captain of the guards, since I am
on duty.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'I should not like
to annoy you,' said the king, kindly, 'for you have always served
me well, Monsieur D'Artagnan.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'You do not
"annoy" me, sire,' I replied; 'I am on duty, that is all.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'But,' said the
king, in astonishment, 'I believe the comte is your friend?'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'If he were my
father, sire, it would not make me less on duty than I am.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The king looked at
me; he saw how unmoved my face was, and seemed satisfied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> 'You will arrest M. le Comte
de la F&egrave;re, then?' he inquired.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Most certainly,
sire, if you give me the order to do so.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Very well; I
order you to do so.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I bowed, and
replied, 'Where is the comte, sire?'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'You will look for
him.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'And am I to
arrest him, wherever he may be?'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Yes; but try that
he may be at his own house.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If he should have started for his
own estate, leave Paris at once, and arrest him on his way
thither.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I bowed; but as I
did not move, he said, 'Well, what are you waiting for?'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'For the order to
arrest the comte, signed by yourself.'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The king seemed
annoyed; for, in point of fact, it was the exercise of a fresh
act of authority, a repetition of the arbitrary act, if, indeed,
it is to be considered as such.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He took hold of his pen slowly, and
evidently in no very good temper; and then he wrote, 'Order for
M. le Chevalier d'Artagnan, captain of my musketeers, to arrest
M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re, wherever he is to be found.'<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then turned towards me; but
I was looking on without moving a muscle of my face.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In all probability he thought he
perceived something like bravado in my tranquil manner, for he
signed hurriedly, and then handing me the order, he said, 'Go,
monsieur!'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I obeyed; and
here I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos pressed his
friend's hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well, let
us set off," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! surely," said
D'Artagnan, "you must have some trifling matters to arrange
before you leave your apartments in this manner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I? - not at
all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, you know,
D'Artagnan, that I have always been a very simple traveler on
this earth, ready to go to the end of the world by the order of
my sovereign; ready to quit it at the summons of my Maker.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What does a man who is thus
prepared require in such a case? - a portmanteau, or a
shroud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am ready at
this moment, as I have always been, my dear friend, and can
accompany you at once."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But, Bragelonne -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have brought him
up in the same principles I laid down for my own guidance; and
you observed that, as soon as he perceived you, he guessed, that
very moment, the motive of your visit.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We have thrown him off his guard for
a moment; but do not be uneasy, he is sufficiently prepared for
my disgrace not to be too much alarmed at it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So, let us go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well, let us
go," said D'Artagnan, quietly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As I broke my
sword in the king's presence, and threw the pieces at his feet, I
presume that will dispense with the necessity of delivering it
over to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are quite
right; and besides that, what the deuce do you suppose I could do
with your sword?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Am I to walk
behind, or before you?" inquired Athos, laughing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will walk arm
in arm with me," replied D'Artagnan, as he took the comte's arm
to descend the staircase; and in this manner they arrived at the
landing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Grimaud, whom
they had met in the ante-room, looked at them as they went out
together in this manner, with some little uneasiness; his
experience of affairs was quite sufficient to give him good
reason to suspect that there was something wrong.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! is that you,
Grimaud?" said Athos, kindly.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "We are going - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To take a turn in
my carriage," interrupted D'Artagnan, with a friendly nod of the
head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Grimaud thanked
D'Artagnan by a grimace, which was evidently intended for a
smile, and accompanied both the friends to the door.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos entered first into the
carriage; D'Artagnan followed him without saying a word to the
coachman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The departure
had taken place so quietly, that it excited no disturbance or
attention even in the neighborhood.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the carriage had reached the
quays, "You are taking me to the Bastile, I perceive," said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I?" said
D'Artagnan, "I take you wherever you may choose to go; nowhere
else, I can assure you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you mean?"
said the comte, surprised.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, surely, my
dear friend," said D'Artagnan, "you quite understand that I
undertook the mission with no other object in view than that of
carrying it out exactly as you liked.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You surely did not expect that I was
going to get you thrown into prison like that, brutally, and
without any reflection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
If I had anticipated that, I should have let the captain of the
guards undertake it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And so - ?" said
Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And so, I repeat
again, we will go wherever you may choose."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My dear friend,"
said Athos, embracing D'Artagnan, "how like you that is!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, it seems
simple enough to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The
coachman will take you to the barrier of the Cours-la-Reine; you
will find a horse there which I have ordered to be kept ready for
you; with that horse you will be able to do three posts without
stopping; and I, on my side, will take care not to return to the
king, to tell him that you have gone away, until the very moment
it will be impossible to overtake you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the meantime you will have
reached Le Havre, and from Le Havre across to England, where you
will find the charming residence of which M. Monk made me a
present, without speaking of the hospitality which King Charles
will not fail to show you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well, what do you think of this
project?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos shook his
head, and then said, smiling as he did so, "No, no, take me to
the Bastile."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are an
obstinate fellow, my dear Athos," returned D'Artagnan, "reflect
for a few moments."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"On what
subject?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That you are no
longer twenty years of age.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Believe me, I speak according to my
own knowledge and experience.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A prison is certain death for men
who are at our time of life.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No, no; I will never allow you to
languish in prison in such a way.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Why, the very thought of it makes my
head turn giddy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Dear D'Artagnan,"
Athos replied, "Heaven most fortunately made my body as strong,
powerful, and enduring as my mind; and, rely upon it, I shall
retain my strength up to the very last moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But this is not
strength of mind or character; it is sheer madness."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, D'Artagnan, it
is the highest order of reasoning.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not suppose that I should in the
slightest degree in the world discuss the question with you,
whether you would not be ruined in endeavoring to save me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should have done precisely
as you propose if flight had been part of my plan of action; I
should, therefore, have accepted from you what, without any
doubt, you would have accepted from me.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know you too well even to breathe
a word upon the subject."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! if you would
only let me do it," said D'Artagnan, "what a dance we would give
his most gracious majesty!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Still he is the
king; do not forget that, my dear friend."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! that is all
the same to me; and king though he be, I would plainly tell him,
'Sire, imprison, exile, kill every one in France and Europe;
order me to arrest and poniard even whom you like - even were it
Monsieur, your own brother; but do not touch one of the four
musketeers, or if so, <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mordioux!</i>'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My dear friend,"
replied Athos, with perfect calmness, "I should like to persuade
you of one thing; namely, that I wish to be arrested; that I
desire above all things that my arrest should take place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan made a
slight movement of his shoulders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nay, I wish it, I
repeat, more than anything; if you were to let me escape, it
would be only to return of my own accord, and constitute myself a
prisoner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I wish to prove
to this young man, who is dazzled by the power and splendor of
his crown, that he can be regarded as the first and chiefest
among men only on the one condition of his proving himself to be
the most generous and the wisest.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He may punish me, imprison, torture
me, it matters not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
abuses his opportunities, and I wish him to learn the bitterness
of remorse, while Heaven teaches him what chastisement is."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, well,"
replied D'Artagnan, "I know only too well that, when you have
once said, 'no,' you mean 'no.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I do not insist any longer; you wish
to go to the Bastile?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I do wish to go
there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let us go,
then!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To the Bastile!"
cried D'Artagnan to the coachman.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And throwing himself back in the
carriage, he gnawed the ends of his mustache with a fury which,
for Athos, who knew him well, signified a resolution either
already taken or in course of formation.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A profound silence ensued in the
carriage, which continued to roll on, but neither faster nor
slower than before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos
took the musketeer by the hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You are not angry
with me, D'Artagnan?" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I! - oh, no!
certainly not; of course not.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What you do for heroism, I should
have done from obstinacy."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But you are quite
of opinion, are you not, that Heaven will avenge me,
D'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And I know one or
two on earth who will not fail to lend a helping hand," said the
captain.</p>

T</span>he carriage arrived at the outside of the gate of the
Bastile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A soldier on
guard stopped it, but D'Artagnan had only to utter a single word
to procure admittance, and the carriage passed on without further
difficulty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whilst they
were proceeding along the covered way which led to the courtyard
of the governor's residence, D'Artagnan, whose lynx eyes saw
everything, even through the walls, suddenly cried out, "What is
that out yonder?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Well," said Athos,
quietly; "what is it?"</p>

Athos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"That would be too
droll."<br>
"I do not understand you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Make haste and
look again, and look at the man who is just getting out of that
carriage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>At that very moment
a second sentinel stopped D'Artagnan, and while the formalities
were being gone through, Athos could see at a hundred paces from
him the man whom his friend had pointed out to him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was, in fact, getting out of the
carriage at the door of the governor's house.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Well," inquired D'Artagnan, "do you
see him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; he is a man
in a gray suit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you say of
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I cannot very well
tell; he is, as I have just now told you, a man in a gray suit,
who is getting out of a carriage; that is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Athos, I will
wager anything that it is he."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He, who?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Aramis
arrested?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Impossible!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I do not say he is
arrested, since we see him alone in his carriage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then, what
is he doing here?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! he knows
Baisemeaux, the governor," replied the musketeer, slyly; "so we
have arrived just in time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In order to see
what we can see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I regret this
meeting exceedingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When
Aramis sees me, he will be very much annoyed, in the first place,
at seeing me, and in the next at being seen."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well
reasoned."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Unfortunately,
there is no remedy for it; whenever any one meets another in the
Bastile, even if he wished to draw back to avoid him, it would be
impossible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Athos, I have an
idea; the question is, to spare Aramis the annoyance you were
speaking of, is it not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is to be
done?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I will tell you;
or in order to explain myself in the best possible way, let me
relate the affair in my own manner; I will not recommend you to
tell a falsehood, for that would be impossible for you to do; but
I will tell falsehoods enough for both; it is easy to do that
when one is born to the nature and habits of a Gascon."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos smiled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The carriage stopped where the
one we have just now pointed out had stopped; namely, at the door
of the governor's house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"It is understood, then?" said D'Artagnan, in a low voice to his
friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos consented
by a gesture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They
ascended the staircase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
There will be no occasion for surprise at the facility with which
they had entered into the Bastile, if it be remembered that,
before passing the first gate, in fact, the most difficult of
all, D'Artagnan had announced that he had brought a prisoner of
state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At the third gate,
on the contrary, that is to say, when he had once fairly entered
the prison, he merely said to the sentinel, "To M. Baisemeaux;"
and they both passed on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
In a few minutes they were in the governor's dining-room, and the
first face which attracted D'Artagnan's observation was that of
Aramis, who was seated side by side with Baisemeaux, awaiting the
announcement of a meal whose odor impregnated the whole
apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If D'Artagnan
pretended surprise, Aramis did not pretend at all; he started
when he saw his two friends, and his emotion was very
apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos and
D'Artagnan, however, complimented him as usual, and Baisemeaux,
amazed, completely stupefied by the presence of his three guests,
began to perform a few evolutions around them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"By what lucky
accident - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"We were just going
to ask you," retorted D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Are we going to
give ourselves up as prisoners?" cried Aramis, with an affection
of hilarity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! ah!" said
D'Artagnan; "it is true the walls smell deucedly like a
prison.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur de
Baisemeaux, you know you invited me to sup with you the other
day."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I?" cried
Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, of course you
did, although you now seem so struck with amazement.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Don't you remember it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux turned
pale and then red, looked at Aramis, who looked at him, and
finished by stammering out, "Certainly - I am delighted - but,
upon my honor - I have not the slightest - Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I have such a wretched memory."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am wrong, I see," said D'Artagnan,
as if he were offended.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Wrong, what
for?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Wrong to remember
anything about it, it seems."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux hurried
towards him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Do not
stand on ceremony, my dear captain," he said; "I have the worst
memory in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I no
sooner leave off thinking of my pigeons and their pigeon-house,
than I am no better than the rawest recruit."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At all events, you
remember it now," said D'Artagnan, boldly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, yes," replied
the governor, hesitating; "I think I do remember."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It was when you
came to the palace to see me; you told me some story or other
about your accounts with M. de Louvi&egrave;re and M. de
Tremblay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, yes!
perfectly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And about M.
d'Herblay's kindness towards you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!" exclaimed
Aramis, looking at the unhappy governor full in the face, "and
yet you just now said you had no memory, Monsieur de
Baisemeaux."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux
interrupted the musketeer in the middle of his revelations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Yes, yes; you're quite right;
how could I have forgotten; I remember it now as well as
possible; I beg you a thousand pardons.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But now, once for all, my dear M.
d'Artagnan, be sure that at this present time, as at any other,
whether invited or not, you are perfectly at home here, you and
M. d'Herblay, your friend," he said, turning towards Aramis; "and
this gentleman, too," he added, bowing to Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, I thought it
would be sure to turn out so," replied D'Artagnan, "and that is
the reason I came.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Having
nothing to do this evening at the Palais Royal, I wished to judge
for myself what your ordinary style of living was like; and as I
was coming along, I met the Comte de la F&egrave;re."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos bowed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The comte, who had just left
his majesty, handed me an order which required immediate
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We were close
by here; I wished to call in, even if it were for no other object
than that of shaking hands with you and of presenting the comte
to you, of whom you spoke so highly that evening at the palace
when - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly,
certainly - M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Precisely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The comte is
welcome, I am sure."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And he will sup
with you two, I suppose, whilst I, unfortunate dog that I am,
must run off on a matter of duty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh! what happy beings you are,
compared to myself," he added, sighing as loud as Porthos might
have done.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And so you are
going away, then?" said Aramis and Baisemeaux together, with the
same expression of delighted surprised, the tone of which was
immediately noticed by D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I leave you in my
place," he said, "a noble and excellent guest."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he touched Athos gently on the
shoulder, who, astonished also, could not help exhibiting his
surprise a little; which was noticed by Aramis only, for M. de
Baisemeaux was not quite equal to the three friends in point of
intelligence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What, are you
going to leave us?" resumed the governor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I shall only be
about an hour, or an hour and a half.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will return in time for
dessert."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! we will wait
for you," said Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, no; that would
be really disobliging me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will be sure
to return, though?" said Athos, with an expression of doubt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Most certainly,"
he said, pressing his friend's hand confidently; and he added, in
a low voice, "Wait for me, Athos; be cheerful and lively as
possible, and above all, don't allude even to business affairs,
for Heaven's sake."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And with a renewed
pressure of the hand, he seemed to warn the comte of the
necessity of keeping perfectly discreet and impenetrable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Baisemeaux led D'Artagnan to
the gate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis, with
many friendly protestations of delight, sat down by Athos,
determined to make him speak; but Athos possessed every virtue
and quality to the very highest degree.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If necessity had required it, he
would have been the finest orator in the world, but on other
occasions he would rather have died than have opened his
lips.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Ten minutes after
D'Artagnan's departure, the three gentlemen sat down to table,
which was covered with the most substantial display of
gastronomic luxury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Large
joints, exquisite dishes, preserves, the greatest variety of
wines, appeared successively upon the table, which was served at
the king's expense, and of which expense M. Colbert would have
found no difficulty in saving two thirds, without any one in the
Bastile being the worse for it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Baisemeaux was the only one who ate
and drank with gastronomic resolution.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis allowed nothing to pass by
him, but merely touched everything he took; Athos, after the soup
and three <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hors
d'&oelig;uvres</i>, ate nothing more.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The style of conversation was such
as might have been anticipated between three men so opposite in
temper and ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis
was incessantly asking himself by what extraordinary chance Athos
was there at Baisemeaux's when D'Artagnan was no longer there,
and why D'Artagnan did not remain when Athos was there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos sounded all the depths
of the mind of Aramis, who lived in the midst of subterfuge,
evasion, and intrigue; he studied his man well and thoroughly,
and felt convinced that he was engaged upon some important
project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then he too
began to think of his own personal affair, and to lose himself in
conjectures as to D'Artagnan's reason for having left the Bastile
so abruptly, and for leaving behind him a prisoner so badly
introduced and so badly looked after by the prison
authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But we shall
not pause to examine into the thoughts and feelings of these
personages, but will leave them to themselves, surrounded by the
remains of poultry, game, and fish, which Baisemeaux's generous
knife and fork had so mutilated.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We are going to follow D'Artagnan
instead, who, getting into the carriage which had brought him,
said to the coachman, "Return to the palace, as fast as the
horses can gallop."</p>

M</span>. de Saint-Aignan had executed the commission with which
the king had intrusted him for La Valli&egrave;re - as we have
already seen in one of the preceding chapters; but, whatever his
eloquence, he did not succeed in persuading the young girl that
she had in the king a protector powerful enough for her under any
combination of circumstances, and that she had no need of any one
else in the world when the king was on her side.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In point of fact, at the very first
word which the favorite mentioned of the discovery of the famous
secret, Louise, in a passion of tears, abandoned herself in utter
despair to a sorrow which would have been far from flattering for
the king, if he had been a witness of it from one of the corners
of the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Saint-Aignan, in his character of ambassador, felt almost as
greatly offended at it as his master himself would have been, and
returned to inform the king what he had seen and heard; and it is
thus we find him, in a state of great agitation, in the presence
of the king, who was, if possible, in a state of even greater
flurry than himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "But," said the king to
the courtier, when the latter had finished his report, "what did
she decide to do?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Shall I
at least see her presently before supper?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Will she come to me, or shall I be
obliged to go to her room?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "I believe, sire, that
if your majesty wishes to see her, you will not only have to take

way."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "That I do not

has yet a secret fancy for young Bragelonne?" muttered the king
between his teeth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh! sire, that is not
possible; for it is you alone, I am convinced, Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re loves, and that, too, with all her heart.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But you know that De
Bragelonne belongs to that proud race who play the part of Roman
heroes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king smiled feebly;
he knew how true the illustration was, for Athos had just left
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "As for Mademoiselle de
la Valli&egrave;re," Saint-Aignan continued, "she was brought up
under the care of the Dowager Madame, that is to say, in the
greatest austerity and formality.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This young engaged couple coldly
exchanged their little vows in the prim presence of the moon and
stars; and now, when they find they have to break those vows
asunder, it plays the very deuce with them."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> Saint-Aignan thought to
have made the king laugh; but on the contrary, from a mere smile
Louis passed to the greatest seriousness of manner.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He already began to experience that
remorse which the comte had promised D'Artagnan he would inflict
upon him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He reflected
that, in fact, these young persons had loved and sworn fidelity
to each other; that one of the two had kept his word, and that
the other was too conscientious not to feel her perjury most
bitterly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And his remorse
was not unaccompanied; for bitter pangs of jealousy began to
beset the king's heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
He did not say another word, and instead of going to pay a visit
to his mother, or the queen, or Madame, in order to amuse himself
a little, and make the ladies laugh, as he himself used to say,
he threw himself into the huge armchair in which his august
father Louis XIII. had passed so many weary days and years in
company with Barradat and Cinq-Mars.<span style=

your majesty intend to do this evening - shall Mademoiselle de la
Valli&egrave;re be informed of your intention to see her?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "It seems she is already
aware of that," replied the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "No, no, Saint-Aignan," he
continued, after a moment's pause, "we will both of us pass our
time in thinking, and musing, and dreaming; when Mademoiselle de
la Valli&egrave;re shall have sufficiently regretted what she now
regrets, she will deign, perhaps, to give us some news of
herself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Ah! sire, is it
possible you can so misunderstand her heart, which is so full of
devotion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king rose, flushed
from vexation and annoyance; he was a prey to jealousy as well as
to remorse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Saint-Aignan
was just beginning to feel that his position was becoming
awkward, when the curtain before the door was raised.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king turned hastily round; his
first idea was that a letter from Louise had arrived; but,
instead of a letter of love, he only saw his captain of
musketeers, standing upright, and perfectly silent in the
doorway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "M. d'Artagnan,"
he said, "ah!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Well,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> D'Artagnan looked at
Saint-Aignan; the king's eyes took the same direction as those of
his captain; these looks would have been clear to any one, and
for a still greater reason they were so for Saint-Aignan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The courtier bowed and quitted
the room, leaving the king and D'Artagnan alone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Is it done?" inquired
the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Yes, sire," replied the
captain of the musketeers, in a grave voice, "it is done."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> The king was unable to
say another word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Pride,
however, obliged him not to pause at what he had done; whenever a
sovereign has adopted a decisive course, even though it be
unjust, he is compelled to prove to all witnesses, and
particularly to prove it to himself, that he was quite right all
through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A good means for
effecting that - an almost infallible means, indeed - is, to try
and prove his victim to be in the wrong.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis, brought up by Mazarin and
Anne of Austria, knew better than any one else his vocation as a
monarch; he therefore endeavored to prove it on the present
occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After a few
moment's pause, which he had employed in making silently to
himself the same reflections which we have just expressed aloud,
he said, in an indifferent tone: "What did the comte say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Nothing at all,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Surely he did not
allow himself to be arrested without saying something?"<br>
"He said he expected to be arrested, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king raised his
head haughtily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I
presume," he said, "that M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re has not
continued to play his obstinate and rebellious part."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In the first
place, sire, what do you wish to signify by <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rebellious?</i>" quietly asked the
musketeer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "A rebel, in
the eyes of the king, is a man who not only allows himself to be
shut up in the Bastile, but still more, who opposes those who do
not wish to take him there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Who do not wish to
take him there!" exclaimed the king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What do you say, captain!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Are you mad?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I believe not,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You speak of
persons who did not wish to arrest M. de la F&egrave;re!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Who are those persons, may I
ask?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I should say those
whom your majesty intrusted with that duty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But it was you
whom I intrusted with it," exclaimed the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire; it was
I."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And yet you say
that, despite my orders, you had the intention of not arresting
the man who had insulted me!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire - that
was really my intention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
I even proposed to the comte to mount a horse that I had prepared
for him at the Barri&egrave;re de la Conf&eacute;rence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And what was your
object in getting this horse ready?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why, sire, in
order that M. le Comte de la F&egrave;re might be able to reach
Le Havre, and from that place make his escape to England."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You betrayed me,
then, monsieur?" cried the king, kindling with a wild pride.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Exactly so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>There was nothing
to say in answer to statements made in such a tone; the king was
astounded at such an obstinate and open resistance on the part of
D'Artagnan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "At least you
had a reason, Monsieur d'Artagnan, for acting as you did?" said
the king, proudly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have always a
reason for everything, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your reason cannot
be your friendship for the comte, at all events, - the only one
that can be of any avail, the only one that could possibly excuse
you, - for I placed you perfectly at your ease in that
respect."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Me, sire?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Did I not give you
the choice to arrest, or not to arrest M. le Comte de la
F&egrave;re?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire, but -
"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But what?"
exclaimed the king, impatiently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But you warned me,
sire, that if I did not arrest him, your captain of the guard
should do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Was I not
considerate enough towards you, from the very moment I did not
compel you to obey me?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To me, sire, you
were, but not to my friend, for my friend would be arrested all
the same, whether by myself or by the captain of the guards."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And this is your
devotion, monsieur! a devotion which argues and reasons.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> You are no soldier,
monsieur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I wait for your
majesty to tell me what I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then - you
are a Frondeur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And since there is
no longer any Fronde, sire, in that case - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But if what you
say is true - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What I say is
always true, sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What have you come
to say to me, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have come to say
to your majesty, 'Sire, M. de la F&egrave;re is in the
Bastile.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is not your
fault, it would seem."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is true,
sire; but at all events he is there; and since he is there, it is
important that your majesty should know it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur d'Artagnan, so you set your
king at defiance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur
d'Artagnan!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I warn you
that you are abusing my patience."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"On the contrary,
sire."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you mean
by 'on the contrary'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have come to get
myself arrested, too."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To get yourself
arrested, - you!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of course.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My friend will get wearied to
death in the Bastile by himself; and I have come to propose to
your majesty to permit me to bear him company; if your majesty
will but give me the word, I will arrest myself; I shall not need
the captain of the guards for that, I assure you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king darted
towards the table and seized hold of a pen to write the order for
D'Artagnan's imprisonment.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Pay attention, monsieur, that this
is forever," cried the king, in tones of sternest menace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I can quite
believe that," returned the musketeer; "for when you have once
done such an act as that, you will never be able to look me in
the face again."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king dashed
down his pen violently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
"Leave the room, monsieur!" he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not so, if it
please your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is that you
say?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire, I came to
speak gently and temperately to your majesty; your majesty got
into a passion with me; that is a misfortune; but I shall not the
less on that account say what I had to say to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Your resignation,
monsieur, - your resignation!" cried the king.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Sire, you know
whether I care about my resignation or not, since at Blois, on
the very day when you refused King Charles the million which my
friend the Comte de la F&egrave;re gave him, I then tendered my
resignation to your majesty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well,
monsieur - do it at once!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, sire; for
there is no question of my resignation at the present
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Your majesty took
up your pen just now to send me to the Bastile, - why should you
change your intention?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"D'Artagnan!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Gascon that you are! who is
king, allow me to ask, - you or myself?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You, sire,
unfortunately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you mean
by 'unfortunately'?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, sire; for if
it were I - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If it were you,
you would approve of M. d'Artagnan's rebellious conduct, I
suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Really!" said the
king, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And I should tell
my captain of the musketeers," continued D'Artagnan, "I should
tell him, looking at him all the while with human eyes, and not
with eyes like coals of fire, 'M. d'Artagnan, I had forgotten
that I was the king, for I descended from my throne in order to
insult a gentleman.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur," said
the king, "do you think you can excuse your friend by exceeding
him in insolence?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! sire!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should go much further than
he did," said D'Artagnan; "and it would be your own fault.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should tell you what he, a
man full of the finest sense of delicacy, did not tell you; I
should say - 'Sire, you have sacrificed his son, and he defended
his son - you sacrificed himself; he addressed you in the name of
honor, of religion, of virtue - you repulsed, drove him away,
imprisoned him.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should
be harder than he was, for I should say to you - 'Sire; it is for
you to choose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you
wish to have friends or lackeys - soldiers or slaves - great men
or mere puppets?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you
wish men to serve you, or to bend and crouch before you?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you wish men to love you,
or to be afraid of you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
If you prefer baseness, intrigue, cowardice, say so at once,
sire, and we will leave you, - we who are the only individuals
who are left, - nay, I will say more, the only models of the
valor of former times; we who have done our duty, and have
exceeded, perhaps, in courage and in merit, the men already great
for posterity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Choose,
sire! and that, too, without delay.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Whatever relics remain to you of the
great nobility, guard them with a jealous eye; you will never be
deficient in courtiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Delay not - and send me to the Bastile with my friend; for, if
you did not know how to listen to the Comte de la F&egrave;re,
whose voice is the sweetest and noblest in all the world when
honor is the theme; if you do not know how to listen to
D'Artagnan, the frankest and honestest voice of sincerity, you
are a bad king, and to-morrow will be a poor king.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And learn from me, sire, that bad
kings are hated by their people, and poor kings are driven
ignominiously away.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That
is what I had to say to you, sire; you were wrong to drive me to
say it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The king threw
himself back in his chair, cold as death, and as livid as a
corpse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Had a thunderbolt
fallen at his feet, he could not have been more astonished; he
seemed as if his respiration had utterly ceased, and that he was
at the point of death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The honest voice of sincerity, as D'Artagnan had called it, had
pierced through his heart like a sword-blade.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan had said
all he had to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Comprehending the king's anger, he drew his sword, and,
approaching Louis XIV. respectfully, he placed it on the
table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the king, with
a furious gesture, thrust aside the sword, which fell on the
ground and rolled to D'Artagnan's feet.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Notwithstanding the perfect mastery
which D'Artagnan exercised over himself, he, too, in his turn,
became pale, and, trembling with indignation, said: "A king may
disgrace a soldier, - he may exile him, and may even condemn him
to death; but were he a hundred times a king, he has no right to
insult him by casting a dishonor upon his sword!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sire, a king of France has never
repulsed with contempt the sword of a man such as I am!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Stained with disgrace as this
sword now is, it has henceforth no other sheath than either your
heart or my own!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I choose
my own, sire; and you have to thank Heaven and my own patience
that I do so."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then
snatching up his sword, he cried, "My blood be upon your head!"
and, with a rapid gesture, he placed the hilt upon the floor and
directed the point of the blade towards his breast.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The king, however, with a movement
far more rapid than that of D'Artagnan, threw his right arm
around the musketeer's neck, and with his left hand seized hold
of the blade by the middle, and returned it silently to the
scabbard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan,
upright, pale, and still trembling, let the king do all to the
very end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Louis, overcome
and softened by gentler feelings, returned to the table, took a
pen in his hand, wrote a few lines, signed them, and then held it
out to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is this
paper, sire?" inquired the captain.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"An order for M.
d'Artagnan to set the Comte de la F&egrave;re at liberty
immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan seized
the king's hand, and imprinted a kiss upon it; he then folded the
order, placed it in his belt, and quitted the room. Neither the
king nor the captain had uttered a syllable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, human heart!
thou guide and director of kings," murmured Louis, when alone,
"when shall I learn to read in your inmost recesses, as in the
leaves of a book!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh, I
am not a bad king - nor am I poor king; I am but still a child,

for dessert, and he kept his word.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They had just reached the finer and
more delicate class of wines and liqueurs with which the
governor's cellar had the reputation of being most admirably
stocked, when the silver spurs of the captain resounded in the
corridor, and he himself appeared at the threshold.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos and Aramis had played a close
game; neither of the two had been able to gain the slightest
advantage over the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
They had supped, talked a good deal about the Bastile, of the
last journey to Fontainebleau, of the intended <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>f&ecirc;te</i> that M. Fouquet was
about to give at Vaux; they had generalized on every possible
subject; and no one, excepting Baisemeaux, had in the slightest
degree alluded to private matters.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan arrived in the very midst
of the conversation, still pale and much disturbed by his
interview with the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Baisemeaux hastened to give him a chair; D'Artagnan accepted a
glass of wine, and set it down empty.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos and Aramis both remarked his
emotion; as for Baisemeaux, he saw nothing more than the captain
of the king's musketeers, to whom he endeavored to show every
possible attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But,
although Aramis had remarked his emotion, he had not been able to
guess the cause of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Athos alone believed he had detected it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For him, D'Artagnan's return, and
particularly the manner in which he, usually so impassible,
seemed overcome, signified, "I have just asked the king something
which the king has refused me."<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thoroughly convinced that his
conjecture was correct, Athos smiled, rose from the table, and
made a sign to D'Artagnan, as if to remind him that they had
something else to do than to sup together.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan immediately understood
him, and replied by another sign.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis and Baisemeaux watched this
silent dialogue, and looked inquiringly at each other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos felt that he was called
upon to give an explanation of what was passing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "The truth is, my
friend," said the Comte de la F&egrave;re, with a smile, "that
you, Aramis, have been supping with a state criminal, and you,
Monsieur de Baisemeaux, with your prisoner."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux uttered
an exclamation of surprise, and almost of delight; for he was
exceedingly proud and vain of his fortress, and for his own
individual profit, the more prisoners he had, the happier he was,
and the higher in rank the prisoners happened to be, the prouder
he felt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Aramis assumed
the expression of countenance he thought the position justified,
and said, "Well, dear Athos, forgive me, but I almost suspected
what has happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Some
prank of Raoul and La Valli&egrave;re, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Alas!" said
Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And," continued
Aramis, "you, a high and powerful nobleman as you are, forgetful
that courtiers now exist - you have been to the king, I suppose,
and told him what you thought of his conduct?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, you have
guessed right."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So that," said
Baisemeaux, trembling at having supped so familiarly with a man
who had fallen into disgrace with the king; "so that, monsieur le
comte - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"So that, my dear
governor," said Athos, "my friend D'Artagnan will communicate to
you the contents of the paper which I perceived just peeping out
of his belt, and which assuredly can be nothing else than the
order for my incarceration."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux held out
his hand with his accustomed eagerness.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan drew two papers from his
belt, and presented one of them to the governor, who unfolded it,
and then read, in a low tone of voice, looking at Athos over the
paper, as he did so, and pausing from time to time: "'Order to
detain, in my ch&acirc;teau of the Bastile, Monsieur le Comte de
la F&egrave;re.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Oh,
monsieur! this is indeed a very melancholy day for me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will have a
patient prisoner, monsieur," said Athos, in his calm, soft
voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"A prisoner, too,
who will not remain a month with you, my dear governor," said
Aramis; while Baisemeaux, still holding the order in his hand,
transcribed it upon the prison registry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not a day, or
rather not even a night," said D'Artagnan, displaying the second
order of the king, "for now, dear M. de Baisemeaux, you will have
the goodness to transcribe also this order for setting the comte
immediately at liberty."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!" said Aramis,
"it is a labor that you have deprived me of, D'Artagnan;" and he
pressed the musketeer's hand in a significant manner, at the same
moment as that of Athos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What!" said the
latter in astonishment, "the king sets me at liberty!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Read, my dear
friend," returned D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos took the
order and read it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "It is
quite true," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Are you sorry for
it?" asked D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, no, on the
contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I wish the king
no harm; and the greatest evil or misfortune that any one can
wish kings, is that they should commit an act of injustice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But you have had a difficult
and painful task, I know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Tell me, have you not, D'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I? not at all,"
said the musketeer, laughing: "the king does everything I wish
him to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis looked
fixedly at D'Artagnan, and saw that he was not speaking the
truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But Baisemeaux had
eyes for nothing but D'Artagnan, so great was his admiration for
a man who seemed to make the king do all he wished.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And does the king
exile Athos?" inquired Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, not precisely;
the king did not explain himself upon that subject," replied
D'Artagnan; "but I think the comte could not well do better
unless, indeed, he wishes particularly to thank the king - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, indeed,"
replied Athos, smiling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then, I
think," resumed D'Artagnan, "that the comte cannot do better than
to retire to his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own</i>
ch&acirc;teau.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However,
my dear Athos, you have only to speak, to tell me what you
want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If any particular
place of residence is more agreeable to you than another, I am
influential enough, perhaps, to obtain it for you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, thank you,"
said Athos; "nothing can be more agreeable to me, my dear friend,
than to return to my solitude beneath my noble trees on the banks
of the Loire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If Heaven
be the overruling physician of the evils of the mind, nature is a
sovereign remedy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so,
monsieur," continued Athos, turning again towards Baisemeaux, "I
am now free, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, monsieur le
comte, I think so - at least, I hope so," said the governor,
turning over and over the two papers in question, "unless,
however, M. d'Artagnan has a third order to give me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, my dear
Baisemeaux, no," said the musketeer; "the second is quite enough:
we will stop there - if you please."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! monsieur le
comte," said Baisemeaux addressing Athos, "you do not know what
you are losing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should
have placed you among the thirty-franc prisoners, like the
generals - what am I saying? - I mean among the fifty-francs,
like the princes, and you would have supped every evening as you
have done to-night."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Allow me,
monsieur," said Athos, "to prefer my own simpler fare."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And then, turning to
D'Artagnan, he said, "Let us go, my dear friend.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Shall I have that greatest of all
pleasures for me - that of having you as my companion?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To the city gate
only," replied D'Artagnan, "after which I will tell you what I
told the king: 'I am on duty.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And you, my dear
Aramis," said Athos, smiling; "will you accompany me?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> La F&egrave;re is on the road to
Vannes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Thank you, my dear
friend," said Aramis, "but I have an appointment in Paris this
evening, and I cannot leave without very serious interests
suffering by my absence."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In that case,"
said Athos, "I must say adieu, and take my leave of you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> My dear Monsieur de
Baisemeaux, I have to thank you exceedingly for your kind and
friendly disposition towards me, and particularly for the
enjoyable specimen you have given me of the ordinary fare of the
Bastile."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, having
embraced Aramis, and shaken hands with M. de Baisemeaux, and
having received best wishes for a pleasant journey from them
both, Athos set off with D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Whilst the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style: normal'>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the
scene of the Palais Royal was taking place at the Bastile, let us
relate what was going on at the lodgings of Athos and
Bragelonne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Grimaud, as
we have seen, had accompanied his master to Paris; and, as we
have said, he was present when Athos went out; he had observed
D'Artagnan gnaw the corners of his mustache; he had seen his
master get into the carriage; he had narrowly examined both their
countenances, and he had known them both for a sufficiently long
period to read and understand, through the mask of their
impassibility, that something serious was the matter.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as Athos had gone, he began
to reflect; he then, and then only, remembered the strange manner
in which Athos had taken leave of him, the embarrassment -
imperceptible as it would have been to any but himself - of the
master whose ideas were, to him, so clear and defined, and the
expression of whose wishes was so precise.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He knew that Athos had taken nothing
with him but the clothes he had on him at the time; and yet he
seemed to fancy that Athos had not left for an hour merely; or
even for a day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A long
absence was signified by the manner in which he pronounced the
word "Adieu."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All these
circumstances recurred to his mind, with feelings of deep
affection for Athos, with that horror of isolation and solitude
which invariably besets the minds of those who love; and all
these combined rendered poor Grimaud very melancholy, and
particularly uneasy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Without being able to account to himself for what he did since
his master's departure, he wandered about the room, seeking, as
it were, for some traces of him, like a faithful dog, who is not
exactly uneasy about his absent master, but at least is
restless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only as, in
addition to the instinct of the animal, Grimaud subjoined the
reasoning faculties of the man, Grimaud therefore felt uneasy and
restless too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Not having
found any indication which could serve as a guide, and having
neither seen nor discovered anything which could satisfy his
doubts, Grimaud began to wonder what could possibly have
happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides,
imagination is the resource, or rather the plague of gentle and
affectionate hearts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
fact, never does a feeling heart represent its absent friend to
itself as being happy or cheerful.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Never does the dove that wings its
flight in search of adventures inspire anything but terror at
home.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Grimaud soon passed
from uneasiness to terror; he carefully went over, in his own
mind, everything that had taken place: D'Artagnan's letter to
Athos, the letter which had seemed to distress Athos so much
after he had read it; then Raoul's visit to Athos, which resulted
in Athos desiring him (Grimaud) to get his various orders and his
court dress ready to put on; then his interview with the king, at
the end of which Athos had returned home so unusually gloomy;
then the explanation between the father and the son, at the
termination of which Athos had embraced Raoul with such sadness
of expression, while Raoul himself went away equally weary and
melancholy; and finally, D'Artagnan's arrival, biting, as if he
were vexed, the end of his mustache, and leaving again in the
carriage, accompanied by the Comte de la F&egrave;re.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All this composed a drama in five
acts very clearly, particularly for so analytical an observer as
Grimaud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The first step he
took was to search in his master's coat for M. d'Artagnan's
letter; he found the letter still there, and its contents were
found to run as follows:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"MY DEAR FRIEND, -
Raoul has been to ask me for some particulars about the conduct
of Mademoiselle de la Valli&egrave;re, during our young friend's
residence in London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am
a poor captain of musketeers, and I am sickened to death every
day by hearing all the scandal of the barracks and bedside
conversations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I had
told Raoul all I believe, I know the poor fellow would have died
of it; but I am in the king's service, and cannot relate all I
hear about the king's affairs.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If your heart tells you to do it,
set off at once; the matter concerns you more than it does
myself, and almost as much as Raoul."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Grimaud tore, not a
handful, but a finger-and-thumbful of hair out of his head; he
would have done more if his head of hair had been in a more
flourishing condition.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," he said,
"that is the key of the whole enigma.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The young girl has been playing her
pranks; what people say about her and the king is true, then; our
young master has been deceived; he ought to know it.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Monsieur le comte has been to see
the king, and has told him a piece of his mind; and then the king
sent M. d'Artagnan to arrange the affair.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ah! gracious goodness!" continued
Grimaud, "monsieur le comte, I now remember, returned without his
sword."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>This discovery made
the perspiration break out all over poor Grimaud's face.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not waste any more time
in useless conjecture, but clapped his hat on his head, and ran
to Raoul's lodgings.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul, after Louise
had left him, had mastered his grief, if not his affection; and,
compelled to look forward on that perilous road over which
madness and revulsion were hurrying him, he had seen, from the
very first glance, his father exposed to the royal obstinacy,
since Athos had himself been the first to oppose any resistance
to the royal will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At
this moment, from a very natural sequence of feeling, the unhappy
young man remembered the mysterious signs which Athos had made,
and the unexpected visit of D'Artagnan; the result of the
conflict between a sovereign and a subject revealed itself to his
terrified vision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As
D'Artagnan was on duty, that is, a fixture at his post without
the possibility of leaving it, it was certainly not likely that
he had come to pay Athos a visit merely for the pleasure of
seeing him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He must have
come to say something to him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This something in the midst of such
painful conjectures must have been the news of either a
misfortune or a danger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Raoul trembled at having been so selfish as to have forgotten his
father for his affection; at having, in a word, passed his time
in idle dreams, or in an indulgence of despair, at a time when a
necessity existed for repelling such an imminent attack on
Athos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The very idea
nearly drove him frantic; he buckled on his sword and ran towards
his father's lodgings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On
his way there he encountered Grimaud, who, having set off from
the opposite pole, was running with equal eagerness in search of
the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The two men
embraced each other most warmly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Grimaud,"
exclaimed Raoul, "is the comte well?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you seen
him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No; where is
he?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am trying to
find out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And M.
d'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Went out with
him."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"When?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ten minutes after
you did."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In what way did
they go out?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In a
carriage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where did they
go?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have no idea at
all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Did my father take
any money with him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Or his sword?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have an idea,
Grimaud, that M. d'Artagnan came in order to - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Arrest monsieur le
comte, do you not think, monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, Grimaud."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I could have sworn
it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What road did they
take?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The way leading
towards the quay."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To the Bastile,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Quick, quick; let
us run."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, let us not
lose a moment."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But where are we
to go?" said Raoul, overwhelmed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"We will go to M.
d'Artagnan's first, we may perhaps learn something there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No; if they keep
me in ignorance at my father's, they will do the same
everywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us go to
- Oh, good heavens! why, I must be mad to-day, Grimaud; I have
forgotten M. du Vallon, who is waiting for and expecting me
still."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where is he,
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At the Minimes of
Vincennes."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Thank goodness,
that is on the same side as the Bastile.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I will run and saddle the horses,
and we will go at once," said Grimaud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do, my friend,
do."</p>

T</span>he good and worthy Porthos, faithful to all the laws of
ancient chivalry, had determined to wait for M. de Saint-Aignan
until sunset; and as Saint-Aignan did not come, as Raoul had
forgotten to communicate with his second, and as he found that
waiting so long was very wearisome, Porthos had desired one of
the gate-keepers to fetch him a few bottles of good wine and a
good joint of meat, - so that, at least, he might pass away the
time by means of a glass or two and a mouthful of something to
eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had just finished
when Raoul arrived, escorted by Grimaud, both of them riding at
full speed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As soon as
Porthos saw the two cavaliers riding at such a pace along the
road, he did not for a moment doubt but that they were the men he
was expecting, and he rose from the grass upon which he had been
indolently reclining and began to stretch his legs and arms,
saying, "See what it is to have good habits.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The fellow has finished by coming,
after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I had gone
away he would have found no one here and would have taken

then threw himself into a martial attitude, and drew himself up
to the full height of his gigantic stature.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But instead of Saint-Aignan, he only
saw Raoul, who, with the most despairing gestures, accosted him

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Porthos gave a

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"Arrested!" he
cried out; "by whom?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"By
D'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"It is impossible,"
said Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>"My dear friend, it
is perfectly true."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos turned
towards Grimaud, as if he needed a second confirmation of the
intelligence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Grimaud
nodded his head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "And
where have they taken him?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Probably to the
Bastile."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What makes you
think that?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"As we came along
we questioned some persons, who saw the carriage pass; and others
who saw it enter the Bastile."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!" muttered
Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you intend
to do?" inquired Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing; only I will not have Athos
remain at the Bastile."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Do you know," said
Raoul, advancing nearer to Porthos, "that the arrest was made by
order of the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos looked at
the young man, as if to say, "What does that matter to me?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This dumb language seemed so
eloquent of meaning to Raoul that he did not ask any other
question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He mounted his
horse again; and Porthos, assisted by Grimaud, had already done
the same.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let us arrange our
plan of action," said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes," returned
Porthos, "that is the best thing we can do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul sighed
deeply, and then paused suddenly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is the
matter?" asked Porthos; "are you faint?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, only I feel
how utterly helpless our position is.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Can we three pretend to go and take
the Bastile?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, if
D'Artagnan were only here," replied Porthos, "I am not so very
certain we would fail."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul could not
resist a feeling of admiration at the sight of such perfect
confidence, heroic in its simplicity.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These were truly the celebrated men
who, by three or four, attacked armies and assaulted
castles!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Men who had
terrified death itself, who had survived the wrecks of a
tempestuous age, and still stood, stronger than the most robust
of the young.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur," said he
to Porthos, "you have just given me an idea; we absolutely must
see M. d'Artagnan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He ought by this
time to have returned home, after having taken my father to the
Bastile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Let us go to his
house."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"First inquire at
the Bastile," said Grimaud, who was in the habit of speaking
little, but that to the purpose.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Accordingly, they
hastened towards the fortress, when one of those chances which
Heaven bestows on men of strong will caused Grimaud suddenly to
perceive the carriage, which was entering by the great gate of
the drawbridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was
the moment that D'Artagnan was, as we have seen, returning from
his visit to the king.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In
vain was it that Raoul urged on his horse in order to join the
carriage, and to see whom it contained.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The horses had already gained the
other side of the great gate, which again closed, while one of
the sentries struck the nose of Raoul's horse with his musket;
Raoul turned about, only too happy to find he had ascertained
something respecting the carriage which had contained his
father.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"We have him," said
Grimaud.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If we wait a
little it is certain he will leave; don't you think so, my
friend?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Unless, indeed,
D'Artagnan also be a prisoner," replied Porthos, "in which case
everything is lost."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul returned no
answer, for any hypothesis was admissible.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He instructed Grimaud to lead the
horses to the little street Jean-Beausire, so as to give rise to
less suspicion, and himself with his piercing gaze watched for
the exit either of D'Artagnan or the carriage.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nor had he decided wrongly; for
twenty minutes had not elapsed before the gate reopened and the
carriage reappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A
dazzling of the eyes prevented Raoul from distinguishing what
figures occupied the interior.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Grimaud averred that he had seen two
persons, and that one of them was his master.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos kept looking at Raoul and
Grimaud by turns, in the hope of understanding their idea.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is clear," said
Grimaud, "that if the comte is in the carriage, either he is set
at liberty or they are taking him to another prison."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"We shall soon see
that by the road he takes," answered Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If he is set at
liberty," said Grimaud, "they will conduct him home."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"True," rejoined
Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The carriage does
not take that way," cried Raoul; and indeed the horses were just
disappearing down the Faubourg St. Antoine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let us hasten,"
said Porthos; "we will attack the carriage on the road and tell
Athos to flee."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Rebellion,"
murmured Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Porthos darted a
second glance at Raoul, quite worthy of the first.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul replied only by spurring the
flanks of his steed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In a
few moments the three cavaliers had overtaken the carriage, and
followed it so closely that their horses' breath moistened the
back of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan,
whose senses were ever on the alert, heard the trot of the
horses, at the moment when Raoul was telling Porthos to pass the
chariot, so as to see who was the person accompanying Athos.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos complied, but could
not see anything, for the blinds were lowered.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Rage and impatience were gaining
mastery over Raoul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
had just noticed the mystery preserved by Athos's companion, and
determined on proceeding to extremities.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On his part D'Artagnan had perfectly
recognized Porthos, and Raoul also, from under the blinds, and
had communicated to the comte the result of his observation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They were desirous only of
seeing whether Raoul and Porthos would push the affair to the
uttermost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And this they
speedily did, for Raoul, presenting his pistol, threw himself on
the leader, commanding the coachmen to stop.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos seized the coachman, and
dragged him from his seat.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Grimaud already had hold of the
carriage door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul
threw open his arms, exclaiming, "M. le comte! M. le comte!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! is it you,
Raoul?" said Athos, intoxicated with joy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not bad, indeed!"
added D'Artagnan, with a burst of laughter, and they both
embraced the young man and Porthos, who had taken possession of
them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"My brave Porthos!
best of friends," cried Athos, "it is still the same old way with
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He is still only
twenty," said D'Artagnan, "brave Porthos!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Confound it,"
answered Porthos, slightly confused, "we thought that you were
being arrested."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"While," rejoined
Athos, "the matter in question was nothing but my taking a drive
in M. d'Artagnan's carriage."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But we followed
you from the Bastile," returned Raoul, with a tone of suspicion
and reproach.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where we had been
to take supper with our friend M. Baisemeaux.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do you recollect Baisemeaux,
Porthos?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very well,
indeed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And there we saw
Aramis."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In the
Bastile?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At supper."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!" said Porthos,
again breathing freely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"He gave us a
thousand messages to you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And where is M. le
comte going?" asked Grimaud, already recompensed by a smile from
his master.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"We were going home
to Blois."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How can that
be?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"At once?" said
Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, right
forward."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Without any
luggage?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh!<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul would have been instructed to
forward me mine, or to bring it with him on his return, <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> he returns."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If nothing detains
him longer in Paris," said D'Artagnan, with a glance firm and
cutting as steel, and as painful (for it reopened the poor young
fellow's wounds), "he will do well to follow you, Athos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There is nothing
to keep me any longer in Paris," said Raoul.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Then we will go
immediately."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And M.
d'Artagnan?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! as for me, I
was only accompanying Athos as far as the barrier, and I return
with Porthos."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good," said
the latter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Come, my son,"
added the comte, gently passing his arm around Raoul's neck to
draw him into the carriage, and again embracing him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Grimaud," continued the comte, "you
will return quietly to Paris with your horse and M. du Vallon's,
for Raoul and I will mount here and give up the carriage to these
two gentlemen to return to Paris in; and then, as soon as you
arrive, you will take my clothes and letters and forward the
whole to me at home."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But," observed
Raoul, who was anxious to make the comte converse, "when you
return to Paris, there will not be a single thing there for you -
which will be very inconvenient."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I think it will be
a very long time, Raoul, ere I return to Paris.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The last sojourn we have made there
has not been of a nature to encourage me to repeat it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul hung down his
head and said not a word more.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Athos descended from the carriage
and mounted the horse which had brought Porthos, and which seemed
no little pleased at the exchange.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Then they embraced, and clasped each
other's hands, and interchanged a thousand pledges of eternal
friendship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Porthos
promised to spend a month with Athos at the first
opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> D'Artagnan
engaged to take advantage of his first leave of absence; and
then, having embraced Raoul for the last time: "To you, my boy,"
said he, "I will write."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Coming from D'Artagnan, who he knew wrote very seldom, these
words expressed everything.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Raoul was moved even to tears.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He tore himself away from the
musketeer and departed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan rejoined
Porthos in the carriage: "Well," said he, "my dear friend, what a
day we have had!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Indeed we have,"
answered Porthos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You must be quite
worn out."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Not quite;
however, I shall retire early to rest, so as to be ready for
to-morrow."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And
wherefore?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Why! to complete
what I have begun."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You make me
shudder, my friend, you seem to me quite angry.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What the devil <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have</i> you begun which is not
finished?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Listen; Raoul has
not fought, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i> must
fight!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"With whom? with
the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How!" exclaimed
Porthos, astounded, "with the king?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, I say, you
great baby, with the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I assure you it is
with M. Saint-Aignan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Look now, this is
what I mean; you draw your sword against the king in fighting
with this gentleman."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah!" said Porthos,
staring; "are you sure of it?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Indeed I am."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What in the world
are we to do, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"We must try and
make a good supper, Porthos.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The captain of the musketeers keeps
a tolerable table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There
you will see the handsome Saint-Aignan, and will drink his
health."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I?" cried Porthos,
horrified.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What!" said
D'Artagnan, "you refuse to drink the king's health?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But, body
alive!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am not talking
to you about the king at all; I am speaking of M. de
Saint-Aignan."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But when I repeat
that it is the same thing?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah, well, well!"
said Porthos, overcome.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You understand,
don't you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No," answered
Porthos, "but 'tis all the same."</p>

T</span>he reader has not forgotten that, on quitting the
Bastile, D'Artagnan and the Comte de la F&egrave;re had left
Aramis in close confabulation with Baisemeaux.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When once these two guests had
departed, Baisemeaux did not in the least perceive that the
conversation suffered by their absence.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He used to think that wine after
supper, and that of the Bastile in particular, was excellent, and
that it was a stimulation quite sufficient to make any honest man
talkative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But he little
knew his Greatness, who was never more impenetrable that at
dessert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His Greatness,
however, perfectly understood M. de Baisemeaux, when he reckoned
on making the governor discourse by the means which the latter
regarded as efficacious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The conversation, therefore, without flagging in appearance,
flagged in reality; for Baisemeaux not only had it nearly all to
himself, but further, kept speaking only of that singular event,
the incarceration of Athos, followed by so prompt an order to set
him again at liberty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Nor, moreover, had Baisemeaux failed to observe that the two
orders of arrest and of liberation, were both in the king's
hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But then, the king
would not take the trouble to write similar orders except under
pressing circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
All this was very interesting, and, above all, very puzzling to
Baisemeaux; but as, on the other hand, all this was very clear to
Aramis, the latter did not attach to the occurrence the same
importance as did the worthy governor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Besides, Aramis rarely put himself
out of the way for anything, and he had not yet told M. de
Baisemeaux for what reason he had now done so.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And so at the very climax of
Baisemeaux's dissertation, Aramis suddenly interrupted him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Tell me, my dear
Baisemeaux," said he, "have you never had any other diversions at
the Bastile than those at which I assisted during the two or
three visits I have had the honor to pay you?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> This address was so
unexpected that the governor, like a vane which suddenly receives
an impulsion opposed to that of the wind, was quite dumbfounded
at it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Diversions!" said
he; "but I take them continually, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Oh, to be sure!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And these diversions?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'mso-tab-count:1'>               </span> "Are of every kind."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Visits, no
doubt?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, not
visits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Visits are not
frequent at the Bastile."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What, are visits
rare, then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very much so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Even on the part
of your society?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What do you term
my society - the prisoners?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, no! - your
prisoners, indeed!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I know
well it is you who visit them, and not they you.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By your society, I mean, my dear
Baisemeaux, the society of which you are a member."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux looked
fixedly at Aramis, and then, as if the idea which had flashed
across his mind were impossible, "Oh," he said, "I have very
little society at present.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If I must own it to you, dear M.
d'Herblay, the fact is, to stay at the Bastile appears, for the
most part, distressing and distasteful to persons of the gay
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As for the ladies,
it is never without a certain dread, which costs me infinite
trouble to allay, that they succeed in reaching my quarters.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And, indeed, how should they
avoid trembling a little, poor things, when they see those gloomy
dungeons, and reflect that they are inhabited by prisoners who -
"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And in proportion as
the eyes of Baisemeaux concentrated their gaze on the face of
Aramis, the worthy governor's tongue faltered more and more until
it ended by stopping altogether.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, you don't
understand me, my dear M. Baisemeaux; you don't understand
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I do not at all mean
to speak of society in general, but of a particular society - of
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the</i> society, in a word
- to which you are affiliated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux nearly
dropped the glass of muscat which he was in the act of raising to
his lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Affiliated,"
cried he, "affiliated!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, affiliated,
undoubtedly," repeated Aramis, with the greatest
self-possession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Are you
not a member of a secret society, my dear M. Baisemeaux?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Secret?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Secret or
mysterious."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, M.
d'Herblay!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Consider, now,
don't deny it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But believe
me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I believe what I
know."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I swear to
you."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Listen to me, my
dear M. Baisemeaux; I say yes, you say no; one of us two
necessarily says what is true, and the other, it inevitably
follows, what is false."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, and
then?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, we shall
come to an understanding presently."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Let us see," said
Baisemeaux; "let us see."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Now drink your
glass of muscat, dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux," said Aramis.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What the devil! you look
quite scared."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, no; not the
least in the world; oh, no."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Drink then."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Baisemeaux drank, but he
swallowed the wrong way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well," resumed
Aramis, "if, I say, you are not a member of a secret or
mysterious society, which you like to call it - the epithet is of
no consequence - if, I say, you are not a member of a society
similar to that I wish to designate, well, then, you will not
understand a word of what I am going to say.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That is all."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! be sure
beforehand that I shall not understand anything."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, well!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Try, now; let us
see!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"That is what I am
going to do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"If, on the
contrary, you are one of the members of this society, you will
immediately answer me - yes or no."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Begin your
questions," continued Baisemeaux, trembling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"You will agree,
dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux," continued Aramis, with the same
impassibility, "that it is evident a man cannot be a member of a
society, it is evident that he cannot enjoy the advantages it
offers to the affiliated, without being himself bound to certain
little services."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"In short,"
stammered Baisemeaux, "that would be intelligible, if - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well," resumed
Aramis, "there is in the society of which I speak, and of which,
as it seems you are not a member - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Allow me," said
Baisemeaux.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "I should not
like to say absolutely."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"There is an
engagement entered into by all the governors and captains of
fortresses affiliated to the order." <span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Baisemeaux grew pale.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Now the
engagement," continued Aramis firmly, "is of this nature."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux rose,
manifesting unspeakable emotion: "Go on, dear M. d'Herblay: go
on," said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis then spoke,
or rather recited the following paragraph, in the same tone as if
he had been reading it from a book: "The aforesaid captain or
governor of a fortress shall allow to enter, when need shall
arise, and on demand of the prisoner, a confessor affiliated to
the order."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He
stopped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Baisemeaux was
quite distressing to look at, being so wretchedly pale and
trembling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Is not that
the text of the agreement?" quietly asked Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monseigneur!"
began Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! well, you
begin to understand, I think."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monseigneur,"
cried Baisemeaux, "do not trifle so with my unhappy mind!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I find myself as nothing in
your hands, if you have the malignant desire to draw from me the
little secrets of my administration."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh! by no means;
pray undeceive yourself, dear M. Baisemeaux; it is not the little
secrets of your administration, but those of your conscience that
I aim at."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, then, my
conscience be it, dear M. d'Herblay.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But have some consideration for the
situation I am in, which is no ordinary one."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is no ordinary
one, my dear monsieur," continued the inflexible Aramis, "if you
are a member of this society; but it is a quite natural one if
free from all engagement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You are answerable only to the king."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well, monsieur,
well!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I obey only the
king, and whom else would you have a French nobleman obey?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis did not
yield an inch, but with that silvery voice of his continued: "It
is very pleasant," said he, "for a French nobleman, for a prelate
of France, to hear a man of your mark express himself so loyally,
dear De Baisemeaux, and having heard you to believe no more than
you do."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you doubted,
monsieur?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I? oh, no!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And so you doubt
no longer?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I have no longer
any doubt that such a man as you, monsieur," said Aramis,
gravely, "does not faithfully serve the masters whom he
voluntarily chose for himself."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Masters!" cried
Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, masters, I
said."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur
d'Herblay, you are still jesting, are you not?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, yes!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I understand that it is a more
difficult position to have several masters than one; but the
embarrassment is owing to you, my dear Baisemeaux, and I am not
the cause of it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Certainly not,"
returned the unfortunate governor, more embarrassed than ever;
"but what are you doing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
You are leaving the table?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Assuredly."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Are you
going?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, I am
going."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But you are
behaving very strangely towards me, monseigneur."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am behaving
strangely - how do you make that out?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Have you sworn,
then, to put me to the torture?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"No, I should be
sorry to do so."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Remain, then."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I cannot."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And why?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because I have no
longer anything to do here; and, indeed, I have duties to fulfil
elsewhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Duties, so late as
this?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes; understand me
now, my dear De Baisemeaux: they told me at the place whence I
came, 'The aforesaid governor or captain will allow to enter, as
need shall arise, on the prisoner's demand, a confessor
affiliated with the order.'<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I came; you do not know what I mean,
and so I shall return to tell them that they are mistaken, and
that they must send me elsewhere."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What! you are - "
cried Baisemeaux, looking at Aramis almost in terror.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"The confessor
affiliated to the order," said Aramis, without changing his
voice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>But, gentle as the
words were, they had the same effect on the unhappy governor as a
clap of thunder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
Baisemeaux became livid, and it seemed to him as if Aramis's
beaming eyes were two forks of flame, piercing to the very bottom
of his soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The
confessor!" murmured he; "you, monseigneur, the confessor of the
order!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, I; but we
have nothing to unravel together, seeing that you are not one of
the affiliated."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monseigneur!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And I understand
that, not being so, you refuse to comply with its command."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monseigneur, I
beseech you, condescend to hear me."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"And
wherefore?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monseigneur, I do
not say that I have nothing to do with the society."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Ah! ah!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I say not that I
refuse to obey."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Nevertheless, M.
de Baisemeaux, what has passed wears very much the air of
resistance."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, no!
monseigneur, no; I only wished to be certain."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"To be certain of
what?" said Aramis, in a tone of supreme contempt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Of nothing at all,
monseigneur."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Baisemeaux
lowered his voice, and bending before the prelate, said, "I am at
all times and in all places at the disposal of my superiors, but
- "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Very good.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I like you better thus,
monsieur," said Aramis, as he resumed his seat, and put out his
glass to Baisemeaux, whose hand trembled so that he could not
fill it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "You were saying
'but' - " continued Aramis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But," replied the
unhappy man, "having received no notice, I was very far from
expecting it."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Does not the
Gospel say, 'Watch, for the moment is known only of God?'<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Do not the rules of the order
say, 'Watch, for that which I will, you ought always to will
also.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And what pretext
will serve you now that you did not expect the confessor, M. de
Baisemeaux?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Because,
monseigneur, there is at present in the Bastile no prisoner
ill."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis shrugged his
shoulders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What do you
know about that?" said he.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"But, nevertheless,
it appears to me - "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"M. de Baisemeaux,"
said Aramis, turning round in his chair, "here is your servant,
who wishes to speak with you;" and at this moment, De
Baisemeaux's servant appeared at the threshold of the door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is it?" asked
Baisemeaux, sharply.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur," said
the man, "they are bringing you the doctor's return."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis looked at De
Baisemeaux with a calm and confident eye.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well," said he,
"let the messenger enter."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The messenger
entered, saluted, and handed in the report.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Baisemeaux ran his eye over it, and
raising his head, said in surprise, "No. 12 is ill!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"How was it, then,"
said Aramis, carelessly, "that you told me everybody was well in
your h&ocirc;tel, M. de Baisemeaux?"<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And he emptied his glass without
removing his eyes from Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>The governor then
made a sign to the messenger, and when he had quitted the room,
said, still trembling, "I think that there is in the article, 'on
the prisoner's demand.'"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes, it is so,"
answered Aramis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "But see
what it is they want with you now."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>And that moment a
sergeant put his head in at the door.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What do you want now?" cried
Baisemeaux.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Can you not
leave me in peace for ten minutes?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Monsieur," said
the sergeant, "the sick man, No. 12, has commissioned the turnkey
to request you to send him a confessor."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux very
nearly sank on the floor; but Aramis disdained to reassure him,
just as he had disdained to terrify him.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "What must I answer?" inquired
Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Just what you
please," replied Aramis, compressing his lips; "that is your
business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style=
'mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i> am not the governor of the
Bastile."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Tell the
prisoner," cried Baisemeaux, quickly, - "tell the prisoner that
his request is granted."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>
The sergeant left the room.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "Oh! monseigneur, monseigneur,"
murmured Baisemeaux, "how could I have suspected! - how could I
have foreseen this!"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Who requested you
to suspect, and who besought you to foresee?" contemptuously
answered Aramis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> "The
order suspects; the order knows; the order foresees - is that not
enough?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is it you
command?" added Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"I? - nothing at
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am nothing but a
poor priest, a simple confessor.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have I your orders to go and see the
sufferer?"</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"Oh, monseigneur, I
do not order; I pray you to go."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'>"'Tis well; conduct
me to him."</p>
